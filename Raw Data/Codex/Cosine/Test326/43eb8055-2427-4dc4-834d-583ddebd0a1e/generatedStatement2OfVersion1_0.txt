Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles non-square matrices:**  It now checks if the matrix is square before transposing.  If not, it prints an error message and returns (you could also throw an exception here if preferred).
* **More efficient transposition:**  The inner loop now starts from `j = i + 1`.  This is because we only need to swap elements above the main diagonal with elements below it.  The previous version swapped elements twice, effectively undoing the transpose.
* **Clearer comments and formatting:**  The code has been slightly reorganized and commented to improve readability.
