Key improvements:

* **Clearer Method Names:**  `count_nums_not_7` is a slightly better name (though `countNumbersWithout7` would be more standard Java style).
* **Helper Function:** The `contains7` function makes the code more readable and modular.
* **Comments:**  Added Javadoc-style comments to explain the purpose of each method and parameter.
* **Example Usage:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `count_nums_not_7` function with a couple of examples.


This improved version adheres to best practices, making it more readable, understandable, and maintainable.
