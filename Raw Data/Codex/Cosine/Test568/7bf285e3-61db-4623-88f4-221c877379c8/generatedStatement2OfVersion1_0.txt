Key improvements in this code:

* **Clarity and Readability:** Improved comments and variable names make the code easier to understand.
* **Sorting:** The time zone IDs are sorted alphabetically, making it easier to find specific zones.
* **Correct UTC/GMT Output:**  It accurately calculates and displays the UTC offset, including Daylight Saving Time (DST), in the format `UTC+HH:MM` or `UTC-HH:MM`. The DST offset is now handled correctly.
* **Consistent Formatting:** The output is formatted consistently for all time zones, using `String.format` to ensure leading zeros and the correct +/- sign.
* **Error Handling (removed):** The previous example's try-catch block wasn't necessary as `TimeZone.getTimeZone()` handles invalid IDs gracefully by returning GMT.  Removing it simplifies the code.
