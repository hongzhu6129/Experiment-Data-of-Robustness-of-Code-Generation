Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:** Includes checks for `null` and empty input arrays.
* **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than `j`.
* **Concise code:**  Removes unnecessary temporary variables.
* **Comprehensive main method:** Tests with various inputs, including edge cases and a case where all elements are already unique.
* **Correct output:**  Prints the updated length and the modified array up to the new length using `Arrays.copyOfRange()` which avoids displaying the unmodified portion of the array.  This clearly demonstrates the in-place nature of the duplicate removal.
