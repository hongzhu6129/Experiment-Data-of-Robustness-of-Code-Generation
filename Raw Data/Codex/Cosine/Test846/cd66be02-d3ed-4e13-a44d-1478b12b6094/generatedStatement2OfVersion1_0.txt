Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Empty or Null Input:** The code now checks for `null` or empty input lists and returns 0 in that case.  You could modify this to throw an exception if that's more appropriate for your use case.

2. **Kadane's Algorithm:**  The core logic uses Kadane's algorithm, which is an efficient way to find the maximum (or in this case, minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray.  

3. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `minSoFar` and `currentMin` are more descriptive than the original `min` and `current`.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `min_SubArray` method with a few different example arrays, including edge cases (single element array, all negative numbers).  This makes testing and understanding the code easier.

5. **Generics with List:** The method signature now uses the more general `List<Integer>` interface, making the code more flexible (it can accept `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, etc.).


How Kadane's algorithm (modified for minimum sum) works:

* **`currentMin`:** Keeps track of the minimum sum ending at the current position `i`.
* **`minSoFar`:** Keeps track of the overall minimum sum found so far.
* At each element, we decide:
    * Either start a new subarray from the current element (`arr.get(i)`).
    * Or extend the previous subarray by including the current element (`currentMin + arr.get(i)`).
* We choose the smaller of these two options to update `currentMin`.
* We then update `minSoFar` if `currentMin` is smaller than the current `minSoFar`.
