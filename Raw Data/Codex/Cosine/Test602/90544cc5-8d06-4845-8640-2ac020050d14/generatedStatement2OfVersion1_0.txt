Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Includes various scenarios:
   - Regular binary numbers.
   - All ones and all zeros.
   - Single digit (0 and 1).
   - Power of 2.
   - Alternating 1s and 0s.
   - **Corner Cases:** Empty string, invalid characters (non-binary digits) like "12345", and leading zeros ("000101")

2. **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles potential `NumberFormatException` if the input is truly invalid (like an empty string). The `valid` flag is used to explicitly check for non-binary characters within the string. This makes the error messages more specific and user-friendly.

3. **Clear Output:**  The output clearly labels the binary input and the corresponding decimal output or indicates "Invalid Input" with some additional information about the error type in the case of invalid input.

4. **No external functions except `main`:**  The code adheres strictly to the requirement, calculating powers of 2 directly within the main method.



This revised version is more robust, handles edge cases correctly, provides informative output, and is well-tested.
