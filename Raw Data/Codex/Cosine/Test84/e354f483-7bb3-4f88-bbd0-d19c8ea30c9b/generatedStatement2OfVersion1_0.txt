Key improvements:

* **Efficiency:**  The Sieve of Eratosthenes is implemented correctly, marking multiples of `p` starting from `p*p` for efficiency.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Comments explain the logic, making the code easier to understand.  Variables are named meaningfully (e.g., `prime`, `primeCount`).
* **Correctness:** The code accurately finds and prints all prime numbers up to the given limit.
* **Demonstrative `main` method:** The `main` method provides examples of how to use the `generatePrimes` method with different input values.
* **Returns an array:**  The `generatePrimes` method now correctly returns an `int[]` containing the prime numbers found. This makes it more reusable.
