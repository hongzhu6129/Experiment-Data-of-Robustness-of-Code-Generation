Key improvements and explanations:

1. **TreeNode Class:**  A `TreeNode` class is introduced to represent the nodes of the binary tree. This makes the code more structured and easier to understand.

2. **Clearer Example Usage:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to create `TreeNode` objects and use the `is_Identical_tree_node` method with various test cases, including cases where one or both trees are `null`, and where the trees have different structures.

3. **Handles Null Cases:** The `is_Identical_tree_node` method explicitly handles cases where one or both input `TreeNode` objects are `null`.  This prevents `NullPointerExceptions` and ensures correct behavior.

4. **Recursive Comparison:** The method uses recursion to efficiently compare the left and right subtrees of the input nodes. The base cases for the recursion are when both nodes are null (identical) or when one is null and the other isn't (not identical).

5. **Value Comparison:** The values of the nodes (`p.val` and `q.val`) are compared before the recursive calls. This is crucial because even if the structures are the same, the trees are not identical if the values at corresponding positions differ.


This improved version is robust, handles edge cases correctly, and clearly demonstrates the logic of comparing two binary trees for identity.
