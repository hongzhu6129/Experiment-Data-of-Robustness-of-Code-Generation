**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10 | 5 | Sum: 15.0 <br> Difference: 5.0 <br> Product: 50.0 <br> Quotient: 2.0 <br> Remainder: 0.0 | Basic positive integers |
| 2 | -5 | 2 | Sum: -3.0 <br> Difference: -7.0 <br> Product: -10.0 <br> Quotient: -2.5 <br> Remainder: -1.0 | Negative and positive integers |
| 3 | 7.5 | 2.5 | Sum: 10.0 <br> Difference: 5.0 <br> Product: 18.75 <br> Quotient: 3.0 <br> Remainder: 0.0 | Positive floating-point numbers |
| 4 | 0 | 10 | Sum: 10.0 <br> Difference: -10.0 <br> Product: 0.0 <br> Quotient: 0.0 <br> Remainder: 0.0 | Zero as the first number |
| 5 | 10 | 0 | Sum: 10.0 <br> Difference: 10.0 <br> Product: 0.0 <br> Division by zero is not allowed. <br> Remainder (modulo) by zero is undefined.  | **Corner Case:** Division by zero |
| 6 | -10 | -2 | Sum: -12.0 <br> Difference: -8.0 <br> Product: 20.0 <br> Quotient: 5.0 <br> Remainder: 0.0 | Negative integers |
| 7 | 0 | 0 | Sum: 0.0 <br> Difference: 0.0 <br> Product: 0.0 <br> Division by zero is not allowed. <br> Remainder (modulo) by zero is undefined. | **Corner Case:** Both numbers are zero |
| 8 | Double.MAX_VALUE | 2 | Sum: 1.7976931348623157E308 <br> ... | **Corner Case:** Check for potential overflow with very large numbers.  |
| 9 | Double.MIN_VALUE | 2 | ... | **Corner Case:** Check handling of very small numbers close to zero. |
| 10 | 10 | Integer.MAX_VALUE |  ... | Check operations with a mix of double and integer types (implicit type conversion) |


**How to Run the Tests:**

You can manually test these cases by entering the values when prompted by the program. For more automated testing, you could use a testing framework like JUnit.  You would create separate test methods for each test case and use assertions to check the actual output against the expected output.


This comprehensive set of test cases helps ensure that the `ArithmeticOperations` program handles a wide range of inputs and potential issues, making it more robust.
