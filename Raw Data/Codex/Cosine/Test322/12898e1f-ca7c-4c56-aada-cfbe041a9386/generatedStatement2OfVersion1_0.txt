**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner/edge cases:

1. **Regular Positive Numbers:**
   - num1 = 125, num2 = 24 (Given example)
   - Expected Output:  As provided in the problem description.

2. **Zero as Second Operand:**
   - num1 = 10, num2 = 0
   - Expected Output:  The program should throw an `ArithmeticException` (division by zero) for division and remainder operations.  Addition, subtraction, and multiplication should work correctly.

3. **Negative Numbers:**
   - num1 = -5, num2 = 2
   - Expected Output:  Correct results for all operations, handling negative values properly.
   - num1 = 5, num2 = -2
   - Expected Output: Correct results for all operations, handling negative values properly.
   - num1 = -5, num2 = -2
   - Expected Output: Correct results for all operations, handling negative values properly.


4. **Large Numbers:**
   - num1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE, num2 = 2
   - Expected Output:  Multiplication might cause integer overflow (wrap around).  Other operations should produce expected (potentially large) results.

5. **Minimum Integer Values:**
   - num1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, num2 = -1  (Important corner case for overflow!)
   - Expected Output: Division should produce `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.  Multiplication will likely overflow to `Integer.MIN_VALUE` (check Java's overflow behavior).

6. **Zero as First Operand:**
    - num1 = 0, num2 = 5
    - Expected output: Correct results for all operations.
