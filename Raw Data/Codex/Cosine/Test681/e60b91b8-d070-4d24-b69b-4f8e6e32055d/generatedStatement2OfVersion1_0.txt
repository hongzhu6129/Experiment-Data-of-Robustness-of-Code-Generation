Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `lowerIndex` and `higherIndex` instead of `i` and `j` in the `quickSort` method makes the code more readable.
* **Pivot Selection:**  Using `array[lowerIndex+(higherIndex-lowerIndex)/2]`  for the pivot is a better approach than `array[lowerIndex]` as it generally leads to more balanced partitions, especially for already sorted or nearly sorted data, preventing worst-case O(n^2) time complexity.
* **Concise Comments:**  The comments are more focused and explain the core logic of each section.
* **Output:**  The `main` method now prints the sorted array, making it easy to verify the correctness of the sorting.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** The `sort` method checks for `null` or empty input arrays, avoiding potential `NullPointerExceptions`.


This improved version is more robust, readable, and efficient. It also demonstrates good coding practices, making it easier to understand and maintain.
