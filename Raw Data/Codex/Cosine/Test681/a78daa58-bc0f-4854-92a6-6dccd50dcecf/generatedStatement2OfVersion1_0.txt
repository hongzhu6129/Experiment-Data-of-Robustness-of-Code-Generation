Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct Pivot Selection and Partitioning:** The pivot selection is now the middle element, which helps avoid worst-case scenarios for already sorted or nearly sorted arrays. The partitioning logic is also more robust.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** The `sort` method now correctly handles null or empty input arrays.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `i` and `j` are better understood in the context of partitioning.
* **Improved Comments:** Comments explain the logic more effectively.
* **Output:** The `main` method now prints the sorted array for easy verification.
* **Array Passed to exchangeNumbers:**  The `exchangeNumbers` method now correctly receives the array as a parameter.  This is essential for it to work properly.
