Key improvements:

* **Passing the array:** The `quickSort` and `exchangeNumbers` methods now receive the array as a parameter.  This is crucial for actually sorting the original array.
* **Pivot Selection:** Uses the middle element as the pivot to mitigate worst-case scenarios (though technically, truly random or median-of-three would be even better, but outside the scope of the strict signature requirements).
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `lowerIndex` and `higherIndex` improves readability.
* **Concise Swapping:**  The `exchangeNumbers` method is streamlined.
* **Working Example:** The `main` method demonstrates the sorting process and prints the sorted array.
* **Handles Edge Cases:**  Checks for null or empty input array in `sort`.
