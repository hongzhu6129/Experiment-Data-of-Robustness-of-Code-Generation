Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles null and empty arrays:** The `removeDuplicates` method now explicitly checks for `null` or empty input arrays and returns 0 appropriately. This avoids potential `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueCount` replaces `k` for better readability.
- **More comprehensive tests:** The `main` method includes tests with different input arrays, including empty and `null` arrays, to demonstrate the robustness of the code.
- **Prints the updated array:**  The `main` method now prints the updated array (with duplicates removed) using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid showing the original, unaltered elements beyond the new length. This clarifies the effect of the `removeDuplicates` function.


This enhanced version addresses edge cases, uses more descriptive variable names, and provides a clearer demonstration of the code's functionality.
