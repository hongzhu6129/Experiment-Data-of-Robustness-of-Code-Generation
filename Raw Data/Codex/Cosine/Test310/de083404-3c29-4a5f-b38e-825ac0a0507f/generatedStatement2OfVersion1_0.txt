Key improvements:

* **Case-insensitivity:** The code now converts the input string to lowercase before counting, ensuring "P" and "p" are treated as the same character.
* **Clearer output:**  The output now explicitly states "Duplicate characters in the string..."  and handles the case where no duplicates are found.
* **`Scanner` for user input:** The `main` method uses a `Scanner` to get input from the user, making it interactive.
* **Example Usage:** Added example calls to `showDuplicates` in the main method to demonstrate different scenarios.
* **Newline added:**  A newline is printed after the output for cleaner formatting in the console.



This revised code fulfills all the requirements of the prompt, is efficient, and provides user-friendly output. It uses the exact method signatures specified and effectively demonstrates the duplicate character counting functionality.
