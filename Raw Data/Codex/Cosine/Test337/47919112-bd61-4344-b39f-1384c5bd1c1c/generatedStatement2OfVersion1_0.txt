Key improvements:

1. **Clearer Method Names:** `rotateString` and `reverse` are more descriptive.
2. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic.
3. **Modulus Operator:** Used the modulus operator (%) to handle offsets larger than the string length and negative offsets correctly.
4. **Comprehensive `main` method:**  Includes various test cases, demonstrating handling of different offset values, including negative offsets, zero offset, offset equal to string length, offset greater than string length, and empty strings.
5. **Reverse In-Place:**  `reverse` method correctly reverses the sub-array in-place, which is more efficient.
6. **Output:** Added `System.out.println()` in `main` to print the rotated string, so you can clearly see the result of each test case.
