**Test Cases (Conceptual - Explained)**

Because the output of the `printFace()` method is a fixed image, traditional unit testing with assertions isn't very effective.  The primary way to "test" this is through visual inspection � does the face look as expected when you run the program?

However, if we were to make the `printFace()` method more complex (and therefore more testable), we could introduce parameters to customize the face.  Here's how we could approach testing with an enhanced version (not implemented here for simplicity, but conceptually):
