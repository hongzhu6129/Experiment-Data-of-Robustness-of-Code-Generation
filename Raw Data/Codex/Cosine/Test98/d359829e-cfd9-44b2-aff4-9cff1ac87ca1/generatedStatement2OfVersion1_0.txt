**Explanation and Test Cases:**

1. **`printFace(int faceType)` method:** This method takes an integer `faceType` as input to determine which face to print. A `switch` statement handles different face types.


2. **Test Cases in `main`:**
   - **Valid Inputs:**  Tests face types 1 (smiling), 2 (frowning), and 3 (surprised).
   - **Default Case:** Tests with `faceType = 0` and other invalid numbers like `4` and `-1` to ensure the default (neutral) face is printed when an invalid `faceType` is provided. This covers corner cases where the user might input an unexpected value.


**How to Run:**

1. Save the code as `Faces.java`.
2. Compile: `javac Faces.java`
3. Run: `java Faces`


**Output:**  You'll see the different faces printed to the console based on the test cases.  The default face will be printed for invalid inputs.



This improved answer addresses the previous issues by:

- Providing more descriptive test cases.
- Including corner cases (invalid inputs).
- Adding comments to explain the code better.
- Using a `switch` statement for cleaner code.
