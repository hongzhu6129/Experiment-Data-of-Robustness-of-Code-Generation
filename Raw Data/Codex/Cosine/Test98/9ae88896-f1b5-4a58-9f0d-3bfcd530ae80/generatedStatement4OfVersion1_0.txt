   Then, examine the `output.txt` file.


3. **Different Operating Systems (if possible):**  If you have access to different OS environments (Windows, macOS, Linux), test the program on each to ensure consistent output.  This helps catch any OS-specific issues related to newline characters (\r\n vs. \n).

4. **Console Size (Less critical but good to consider):**  Although less crucial for a simple program like this, resizing the console window shouldn't affect the face's structure.  It should still be rendered correctly, even if the console becomes very narrow or very wide.


**Example of a more testable approach (if you wanted to demonstrate unit testing principles):**

If you wanted to create a more testable version, you could separate the face construction from the printing:
