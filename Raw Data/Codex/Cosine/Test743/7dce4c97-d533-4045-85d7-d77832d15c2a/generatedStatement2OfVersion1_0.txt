Key Improvements:

* **Handles Unequal Division:**  The code now explicitly checks if the string's length is divisible by `n`. If not, it prints a message indicating that equal division is not possible.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes handling for `null` or empty input strings, preventing `NullPointerException` or other unexpected behavior.
* **Clearer Output:**  Added newlines to separate the output for different test cases, making it more readable.
* **More Test Cases:** Demonstrates various scenarios, including successful splits and cases where the string can't be divided equally. This makes the code more robust and easier to understand.
