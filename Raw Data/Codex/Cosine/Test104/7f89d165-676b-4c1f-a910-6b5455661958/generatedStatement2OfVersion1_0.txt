Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException`. This is crucial because if the input string `str` cannot be parsed into a number (e.g., it contains letters or special characters), the program would crash without error handling.  The error message now also outputs the string that caused the error, making debugging easier.
2. **Clearer Output:** The `println` statements are more descriptive, making it clear which value is being printed (int, long, float, double).
3. **+6 Clarification:**  The code now explicitly adds 6 to the integer value and prints the result, addressing the "+6" requirement in a more understandable way.  If you meant something different by "+6" (e.g., adding "6" to the string, or something else), please clarify.
4. **Example String:** An example string "12345" is provided.  You can change this to test with different inputs.


How to run:

1. Save the code as `StringConversions.java`.
2. Compile: `javac StringConversions.java`
3. Run: `java StringConversions`


Example Output (with `str = "12345"`):
