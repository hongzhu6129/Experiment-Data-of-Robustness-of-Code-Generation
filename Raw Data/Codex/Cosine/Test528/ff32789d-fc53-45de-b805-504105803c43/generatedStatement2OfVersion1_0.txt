**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Example Case (Provided in Prompt):**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -74
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0 
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

4. **Antipodal Points (Opposite sides of Earth):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 106  (180 degrees away in longitude)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)



5. **Points near the Prime Meridian/International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0.1  (Near Prime Meridian)
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: -179.9 (Near Date Line, but still close)
   - Expected Distance: A small value.  This tests handling of the longitude wrapping.

6. **Large Longitude Difference (crossing date line):**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Distance: A small value (since these points are close). This tests handling of longitude differences exceeding 180 degrees.


7. **Invalid Input (optional):**  You could add tests with invalid latitude/longitude values (e.g., latitude > 90 or < -90) to ensure your program handles them gracefully (perhaps by throwing an exception or printing an error message).



**How to Run Tests:**

The simplest way to test is to manually input these values into your Java program and check the output against the expected values using a calculator. For more automated testing, you could use a Java testing framework like JUnit.  You could create test methods, each using  `assertEquals()` to compare the calculated distance with the expected distance within a small tolerance (to account for floating-point precision).
