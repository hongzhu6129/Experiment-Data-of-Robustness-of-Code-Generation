Key improvements:

1. **Input Validation:**  The code now checks if the `startPosition` is valid (within the bounds of the LinkedList).  This prevents `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if an invalid position is provided.

2. **Clearer Output:** The output is more informative, indicating the starting position.

3. **ListIterator:** Uses `ListIterator` which is the most efficient way to iterate from a specific position in a `LinkedList`. `ListIterator`  also allows both forward and backward iteration.

4. **Example of Backwards Iteration:** Added a demonstration of how to iterate *backwards* from a given position using `hasPrevious()` and `previous()`.


This revised version is more robust and demonstrates best practices for iterating through `LinkedList` elements from a specified point.
