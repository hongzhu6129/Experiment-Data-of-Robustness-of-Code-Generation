Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Comparator Implementation:** The code now demonstrates both descending and ascending sort order using separate examples.  The `StringComparator` class implements the `Comparator<String>` interface correctly.  It's made `static` because it's a nested class and we don't want it to have an implicit reference to the enclosing `TreeMapSortByKey` instance.

2. **Demonstrates both Ascending and Descending Order:** The code shows how to create TreeMaps sorted in both ascending and descending order, making it easier to understand how Comparators control sorting.

3. **Improved Comments:**  The comments explain the code more clearly.

4. **Better Structure:** The code is structured more logically, separating the main logic from the Comparator implementation.

5. **`putAll()` for Copying:**  The code now uses `putAll()` to efficiently copy elements from one TreeMap to another when demonstrating the ascending sort order.

How to compile and run:

1. Save the code as `TreeMapSortByKey.java`.
2. Compile: `javac TreeMapSortByKey.java`
3. Run: `java TreeMapSortByKey`


This will output the TreeMap sorted first in descending order (due to `StringComparator`) and then in ascending order (due to the anonymous Comparator in the second example).
