Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles Maximum Week and Day:**  Uses `getActualMaximum()` to correctly determine the maximum week of the year and the maximum day of the month. These values can vary slightly from year to year and month to month.
- **Clearer Output:**  The output now explicitly labels the current and maximum values and provides context (e.g., 0-indexed for the month). Also the name of the maximum month.
- **getMonthName() helper function:** Extracts month name display logic into a separate function, making the code more organized and easier to understand.  It also includes bounds checking for robustness.
- **Comments:** Added more comments to explain the purpose of different parts of the code and the nature of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
- **Practical Limit for Year:** Clarified that `Integer.MAX_VALUE` represents a practical limit for representing the year within the `int` data type, rather than a true calendar limit.


This revised code provides a more complete and accurate solution to the problem.
