To run this from the command line with an argument:

1. **Compile:** `javac ExtractFirstHalf.java`
2. **Run:** `java ExtractFirstHalf your_string_here`  (Replace `your_string_here` with your desired even-length string).


If you don't provide a command-line argument, the hardcoded `pythonpyt` string will be used. If you uncomment the command-line argument section, it will prioritize taking the input from the command line.
