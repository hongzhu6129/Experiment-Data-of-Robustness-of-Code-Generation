Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer separation of concerns:** The code to be measured is placed within the timing block, making it easy to change or add more code to measure without modifying the timing logic.
* **More realistic example:** The example code now includes a loop and a calculation, which is more representative of real-world code than a simple print statement.
* **Illustrates multiple code blocks:** Demonstrates that you can measure the combined execution time of several pieces of code within the `main` method.
* **Simpler output:** Prints only the execution time, making it easier to analyze the results.





To measure a specific portion of code, enclose it between `startTime` and `endTime`.  For example:
