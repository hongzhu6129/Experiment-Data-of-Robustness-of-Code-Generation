Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles empty arrays and null input.
* **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` makes the purpose more obvious.
* **Concise logic:** The core logic remains efficient and easy to understand.
* **Comprehensive testing in `main`:** Includes various test cases, including empty, null, and arrays with and without duplicates, to demonstrate correct functionality.
* **Output Formatting:**  Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` and `Arrays.toString` in `main` to neatly print only the relevant portion of the modified array (up to the new length). This prevents displaying leftover elements from the original array that are no longer considered part of the result after duplicate removal.



This revised code addresses potential issues and provides more robust and well-tested solution while adhering to the requested method signatures.
