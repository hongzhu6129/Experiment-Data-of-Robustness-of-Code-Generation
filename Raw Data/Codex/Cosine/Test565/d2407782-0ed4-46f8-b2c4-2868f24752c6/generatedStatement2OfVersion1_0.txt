**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`isPrime()` helper function:**  This function efficiently checks if a number is prime. It handles the base cases (n <= 1) and optimizes the loop by only checking divisors up to the square root of `n`.

2. **`prime_cell()` function:** This function now uses the `isPrime()` helper to determine the value of each cell.  It returns 0 for false and 1 for true to be consistent with the boolean values later assigned.

3. **`main()` function:**
   - It creates a 2D boolean array `a` of size `m x m`. You can modify `m` to change the array's dimensions.
   - It iterates through the array using nested loops, calling `prime_cell()` to determine the value of each cell `a[i][j]`. The result (0 or 1) is then converted to a boolean value (false or true) using  `prime_cell(i, j) == 1`.
   - It prints the boolean values with spaces in between. A newline is added at the end for cleaner output.

**Example Output (with `m = 3`):**
