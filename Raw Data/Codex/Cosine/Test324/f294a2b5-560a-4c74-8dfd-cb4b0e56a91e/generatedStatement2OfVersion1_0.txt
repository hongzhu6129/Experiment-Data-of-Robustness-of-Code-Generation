This code demonstrates three ways to insert at the end of a LinkedList:

1. **`add(element)`:**  The most common and straightforward approach.
2. **`offerLast(element)`:** Functionally similar to `add()`, but returns a boolean indicating success. In the case of `LinkedList`, it will always return `true` since it's not capacity-constrained.  It's more useful in queue-like scenarios where capacity might be an issue.
3. **`addLast(element)`:**  Explicitly adds at the end and is functionally equivalent to `add()`.

The example includes inserting both `String` and `int` elements to showcase the flexibility of `LinkedList`. Java's autoboxing automatically converts `int` to `Integer` when adding to the `LinkedList<Integer>`.
