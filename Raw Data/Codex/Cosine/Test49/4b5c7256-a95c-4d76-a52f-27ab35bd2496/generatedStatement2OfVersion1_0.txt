Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`java.time` API:**  Uses the modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8) which is significantly better than older date/time classes like `Date` and `Calendar`.  It's much clearer, easier to use, and handles time zones and other complexities more effectively.

2. **Input Validation:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle `DateTimeParseException`. This is crucial for robust code.  It prevents the program from crashing if the user enters dates in the wrong format.

3. **Clear Prompts:**  Provides clear prompts to the user, making it easier to understand what input is expected.

4. **`Period` Class:** Uses the `Period` class to calculate the difference between dates, directly giving the difference in years, months, and days.

5. **Absolute Difference:** Uses `Math.abs()` to ensure the output always shows the positive difference regardless of which date is earlier.

6. **Resource Management:** Closes the `Scanner` using `scanner.close()` to release the resource. This is good practice, especially in larger applications.
