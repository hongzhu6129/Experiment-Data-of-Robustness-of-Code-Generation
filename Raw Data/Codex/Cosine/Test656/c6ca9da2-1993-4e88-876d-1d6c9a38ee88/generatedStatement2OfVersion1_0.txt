Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles null and empty arrays:** The `compareFirstLast` method now explicitly checks for `null` arrays and empty arrays.  This prevents `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` errors.
* **Clearer variable names:**  Using `arr1` and `arr2` is slightly more descriptive than `a` and `b`.
* **More test cases:** The `main` method includes more test cases to demonstrate the handling of different array scenarios, including empty arrays and arrays with a single element.  This improves testing thoroughness.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the purpose of the code sections.
* **Conciseness:** The comparison logic is streamlined and easier to read.
