Key improvements:

* **Handles null and empty arrays:** The code now explicitly checks for `null` arrays and empty arrays to prevent `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This makes the code much more robust.
* **Clearer logic:** The comparison of first and last elements is now more concise and easier to understand.
* **Example Usage and Output:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `compareFirstAndLast` method and prints the expected output for different test cases, including edge cases like empty and null arrays.  This makes the code easier to test and understand.
* **Helper Method:** The comparison logic is encapsulated within the  `compareFirstAndLast` method, making the `main` method cleaner and promoting code reusability.


This improved version addresses the potential issues of the previous version and makes it more reliable and practical.
