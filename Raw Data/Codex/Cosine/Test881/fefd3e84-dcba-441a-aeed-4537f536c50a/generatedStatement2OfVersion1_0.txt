Key improvements in this version:

* **Input Validation:** It now handles potential `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters an invalid date format.  This makes the code more robust.
* **Clear Error Message:**  If the date format is wrong, a user-friendly error message is displayed.
* **Conciseness:** The code is a bit more concise while maintaining readability.
* **Standard Date/Time Library:** Uses `java.time` (introduced in Java 8), which is the preferred way to handle dates and times in modern Java.  It's much better than older classes like `Date` and `Calendar`.
* **`Period` for Age Calculation:**  Uses `Period.between()` for accurate calculation of years, months, and days, handling leap years and other date/time complexities correctly.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CalculateAge.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:  `javac CalculateAge.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code with: `java CalculateAge`


The program will then prompt you to enter your birthdate.
