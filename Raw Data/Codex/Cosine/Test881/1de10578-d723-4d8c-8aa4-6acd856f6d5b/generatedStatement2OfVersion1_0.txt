This improved version:

1. **Handles invalid input:** It uses a `try-catch` block to catch `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters the date in the wrong format. This prevents the program from crashing.
2. **Uses `LocalDate` and `Period`:** These classes from the `java.time` package provide a much cleaner and more reliable way to work with dates and calculate age compared to manual calculations.
3. **Clear prompts and output:** The program provides clear instructions to the user and formats the output nicely.
4. **Good coding practices:**  Uses meaningful variable names and includes comments where necessary.
