Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Prompts:**  More descriptive prompts guide the user on what to input.
* **Detailed Output Summary:**  A formatted summary makes the results easy to understand.
* **Net Income Analysis:**  Provides feedback based on whether the net income is positive, negative, or zero.
* **Resource Management:** Closes the `Scanner` using `input.close()` to prevent resource leaks.  This is good practice.
* **Error Handling (Basic):** Using `nextDouble()` assumes the user will input valid numbers. More robust error handling (e.g., using `try-catch` blocks) could be added if desired to handle invalid input gracefully.


How to compile and run:
