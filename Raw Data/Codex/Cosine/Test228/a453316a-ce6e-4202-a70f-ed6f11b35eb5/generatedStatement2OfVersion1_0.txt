Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

1. **Multiple Copying Methods:**  The code now demonstrates three different ways to copy a LinkedList:
   - **Constructor:**  `LinkedList<String> copiedList1 = new LinkedList<>(originalList);` This is the most concise and often preferred way.
   - **`addAll()`:** `copiedList2.addAll(originalList);`  This method is also very efficient.
   - **Iterative Copy:**  The iterative approach (using a `for-each` loop) is included to illustrate the fundamental logic behind copying � iterating through the original list and adding each element to the new list.  Understanding this basic approach can be helpful for other data structure manipulations.

2. **Verification and Clarity:** The code includes `System.out.println()` statements to print the original and copied lists, making it easy to verify that the copying process worked correctly.

3. **Demonstrating Independence:** The code adds a section that modifies both the original and a copied list *after* the copying. This crucial step shows that changes made to one list do *not* affect the other, proving that a true copy (not just a reference assignment) has been created.

4. **Comments:** Clear and concise comments explain each part of the code, improving readability and understanding.  The importance of creating independent copies (not just shared references) is emphasized.


This improved example provides a more comprehensive and educational demonstration of copying LinkedLists in Java.
