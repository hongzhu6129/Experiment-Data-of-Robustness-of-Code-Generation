**Explanation and Key Points:**

1. **`.equals()` Method (Recommended):**  The `equals()` method is the primary way to compare the *content* of two strings in Java.  It checks character by character to see if the strings are identical in value. *Always use `equals()` for string content comparison.*

2. **`==` Operator (Use with Caution):** The `==` operator compares *references* or memory addresses.  For string literals (strings directly written in the code like "hello"), the Java compiler often optimizes by using the same memory location for identical literals (string interning).  However, if you create strings using the `new String()` constructor, they will have different memory locations even if their content is the same. Therefore, `==` might give unexpected results and should be avoided for string content comparison unless you specifically intend to check for reference equality.

3. **NullPointerException Avoidance:**  Attempting to call a method on a `null` object results in a `NullPointerException`.  When comparing strings where one or both could be null, the safe approach is:
   - Use `object1.equals(object2)`  (if you are sure object1 is not null).
   - Use `Objects.equals(object1, object2)` (Java 7 and later). This handles nulls correctly for both strings.

4. **Example Demonstrations:** The provided code demonstrates all of these cases so you can see the differences in behavior.


**In Summary:** To reliably check if two strings contain the same data (characters), *always* use the `.equals()` method or `Objects.equals()` for null safety.  Avoid `==` unless you specifically need to compare memory addresses.
