Explanation:

1. **TreeMap:** We use a `TreeMap` because it stores keys in a sorted order, which makes finding the greatest key less than a given key efficient.

2. **lowerKey() method:** The `TreeMap` class provides the `lowerKey(K key)` method. This method directly returns the greatest key strictly less than the given key.  If no such key exists, it returns `null`.

3. **Generics:** The `getGreatestKeyLessThan` method uses generics `<K, V>` so it can work with TreeMaps of any key-value type.

4. **Example Usage in main():** The `main` method demonstrates how to create a TreeMap, add some entries, and then call the `getGreatestKeyLessThan` method to find the desired key.  It includes examples with both `Integer` and `String` keys to show the generic nature of the method.
