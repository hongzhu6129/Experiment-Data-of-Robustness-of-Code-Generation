**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handle Remainder 0:** The crucial part is handling the case where the remainder is 0. In Excel's column naming system,  Z is represented as 26, and AA as 27.  When `n % 26` is 0, it indicates that the character should be 'Z', and we need to adjust `n` by subtracting 1 before the next division ( `n = (n / 26) - 1`).

2. **StringBuilder for Efficiency:** Using `StringBuilder` is more efficient than string concatenation using `+` for repeated modifications, especially in loops.

3. **Reverse the String:** Since we build the column name from right to left, we reverse the `StringBuilder` at the end to get the correct order.

4. **Clearer Character Conversion:** The character calculation `(char) ((rem - 1) + 'A')` is a concise way to convert the remainder to its corresponding uppercase letter.

5. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes a variety of test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the `Column` method, including edge cases like 26, 27, 52, 702, and larger numbers.


This improved code correctly generates Excel column names for any given positive integer input, addressing the issues of the previous versions.
