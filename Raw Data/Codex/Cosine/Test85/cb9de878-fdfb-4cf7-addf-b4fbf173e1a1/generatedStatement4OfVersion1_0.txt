This makes it easy to automate the testing process. You can compare the program's output with the expected output for each test case.


Key improvements in this version:

- **Input Validation:** Handles `InputMismatchException` to prevent crashes due to invalid input.
- **Resource Management:** `scanner.close()` in the `finally` block ensures that the scanner is closed even if exceptions occur.
- **Clearer Error Message:** Provides a more user-friendly error message in case of invalid input.
- **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Includes a more robust set of test cases, including edge cases and clear expected outputs.
- **Testing Instructions:** Provides instructions for how to efficiently test the program using input redirection.
