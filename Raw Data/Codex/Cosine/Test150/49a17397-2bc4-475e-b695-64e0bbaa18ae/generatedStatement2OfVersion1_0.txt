**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` input, returning 0 in both cases.

2. **Clearer Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` is used to explicitly represent the index of the last unique element, improving readability.

3. **Concise Logic:** The core logic within the loop is simplified and easier to understand.

4. **Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method includes various test cases, including empty arrays, null input, arrays with duplicates, and arrays without duplicates, to demonstrate the robustness of the code.

5. **Output Clarity:** The `main` method prints the updated length *and* the relevant portion of the modified array (using `Arrays.copyOfRange`) to showcase the changes.  This avoids showing the "garbage" values that might remain after the unique elements.


This revised version is more efficient, handles edge cases correctly, and is easier to understand and maintain. It effectively addresses the problem requirements within the specified method signature constraints.
