Key improvements and explanations:

* **Uses `java.time`:** This modern Java date/time API is preferred over the older `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes.  It's much cleaner and easier to use.
* **`DateTimeFormatter`:**  Handles the formatting logic clearly and efficiently.
* **`LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`:**  These classes represent dates, times, and combined date-times, respectively. Use the appropriate class for the type of value you're working with.
* **Clearer Formatting Patterns:** Uses standard format pattern letters (e.g., `MM`, `dd`, `yyyy`, `HH`, `mm`, `ss`, `MMMM` for full month name, `MMM` for abbreviated month name).
* **Example with Specific Date/Time:** Demonstrates how to format a date and time that you set yourself.
* **Comments:**  Explains the purpose of each section of the code.


This improved code is more robust, easier to understand, and uses best practices for date and time handling in Java.
