4. **Delta/Tolerance in Assertions:**  When comparing floating-point numbers, it's essential to use a delta/tolerance value in your assertions because of the way floating-point numbers are represented. The `0.000001` or `1e-30` in the `assertEquals` calls provide this tolerance.


How to Run the Tests:

If you are using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you should be able to right-click on the `CircleCalculationsTest` class and select "Run Tests".  If you're using the command line and have JUnit 5 set up, you can typically use a command like `./gradlew test` (Gradle) or `mvn test` (Maven).



This revised answer provides a much more complete and robust solution, with comprehensive tests to ensure the correctness of your `calculatePerimeter` and `calculateArea` functions.
