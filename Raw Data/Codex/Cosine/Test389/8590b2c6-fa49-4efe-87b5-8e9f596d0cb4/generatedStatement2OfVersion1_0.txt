Key improvements and explanations for the test cases:

* **JUnit 5:** The test cases now use JUnit 5, a standard and powerful testing framework for Java. This makes the tests more organized, easier to run, and provides better reporting.  Make sure you have the JUnit 5 library in your project.  If using Maven or Gradle, add the dependency for JUnit Jupiter.
* **Assertions:** Assertions (like `assertEquals`) from JUnit are used to verify the expected results of the calculations.
* **Delta for Double Comparisons:** When comparing floating-point numbers (doubles), it's essential to use a delta to account for potential rounding errors. `assertEquals(expected, actual, delta)` checks if the `actual` value is within `delta` of the `expected` value.
* **Corner Cases:**
    * **Zero Radius:** Tests the behavior with a radius of 0.
    * **Large Radius:** Tests with a large radius to check for potential overflow or precision issues.
* **Negative Radius:** The `testNegativeRadius_ExceptionExpected()` now correctly tests for an `IllegalArgumentException` using JUnit 5's `assertThrows`.  This is the preferred way to test for exceptions.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** The assertions now have more descriptive error messages. This makes it easier to understand which test failed and why.




How to run the JUnit Tests:

1. **IDE:** If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you should be able to right-click on the test class or individual test methods and select "Run".  The IDE will handle running the tests and displaying the results.

2. **Command Line (Maven):** If you're using Maven, you can run the tests from the command line using:  `mvn test`

3. **Command Line (Gradle):**  If using Gradle, run the tests with: `gradlew test`



These improvements make the code more robust, easier to test, and adhere to best practices for Java development.
