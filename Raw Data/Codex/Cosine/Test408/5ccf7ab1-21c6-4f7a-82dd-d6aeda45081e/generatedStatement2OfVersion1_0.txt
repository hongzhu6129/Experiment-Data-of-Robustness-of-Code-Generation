Key improvements in this version:

* **More Robust Regex:** The regular expression now handles a wider variety of phone number formats, including those with or without parentheses, hyphens, and optional country codes (e.g., +1).
* **Clearer Code:** The code is more organized and easier to read.
* **More Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method includes multiple test cases to demonstrate the validator's capabilities.
* **Conciseness:** The `validate` method is concise and focused solely on validation logic.
* **Correct Return Type:** The `validate` method now correctly returns a `Boolean` (true or false).



This revised code provides a much more reliable and practical solution for validating phone numbers in Java.  You can easily adjust the regular expression to match even more specific phone number formats if needed.
