Key improvements in this educational version:

* **Clearer Comments:**  Comments explain each step within the `reverse` method.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** Demonstrates how the code behaves with a single-node list and an empty list, making it more robust.
* **Output Enhanced:** The `printList` method and `main` method now provide clearer output labels, making it easier to understand the process.
* **Conciseness:**  The code is streamlined while maintaining clarity.


This improved version addresses the prompt's requirements for an educational resource effectively by showing the reversal algorithm's logic and handling different scenarios.
