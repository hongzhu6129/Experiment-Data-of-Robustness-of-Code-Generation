Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:** Added comments to explain the logic, especially the role of `k`.
* **Output Formatting:** Used `Arrays.toString()` for cleaner output of array contents.
* **Preserving Original Array in Output:**  Used `Arrays.copyOf()`  so that the printed "original array" isn't affected by the `removeElement` modifications.  Now the output accurately reflects the initial state and the modified state (up to the new length).
* **Added Test Cases:** Included a couple more test cases to demonstrate how it handles different scenarios.
