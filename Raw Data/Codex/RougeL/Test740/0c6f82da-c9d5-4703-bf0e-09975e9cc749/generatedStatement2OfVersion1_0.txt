Explanation:

1. **TreeMap:** We use a `TreeMap` because it stores keys in sorted order, making it efficient to find the greatest key less than a given key.

2. **lowerKey() method:** The `lowerKey(K key)` method of `TreeMap` directly returns the greatest key strictly less than the given `key`.  If no such key exists, it returns `null`.

3. **Handling null:** We check if `lowerKey()` returns `null`. If it does, we print "No such key" to indicate the absence of a smaller key; otherwise, we print the returned key.

4. **Example Usage:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use `TreeMap` and `lowerKey()` with both integer and string keys, providing clear examples of how to handle cases where a smaller key exists and where it doesn't.
