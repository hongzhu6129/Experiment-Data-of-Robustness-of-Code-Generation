Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer variable names:** `evenCount` and `oddCount` improve readability.
* **Enhanced comments:**  The comments explain the example array and show an alternative (less flexible) way to manually populate the array in `main` if needed.
* **Commented out alternative:** The less common manual input method is commented out to avoid confusion but is there if someone specifically needs to see that approach.



This adheres strictly to the `void main(String[])` requirement while providing a complete, testable solution. It also demonstrates how to manually create and populate an array within `main` if absolutely necessary.
