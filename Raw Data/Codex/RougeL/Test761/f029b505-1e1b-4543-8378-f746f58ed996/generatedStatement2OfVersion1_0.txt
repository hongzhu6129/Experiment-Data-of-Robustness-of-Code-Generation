Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Dummy Node:** The `dummy` node simplifies edge cases, especially when removing the head of the list.  It eliminates the need for special handling.

2. **Fast and Slow Pointers:** The fast and slow pointers are the most efficient way to find the nth node from the end without needing to know the list's length.  The `fast` pointer moves `n` steps ahead, and then both pointers move together until `fast` reaches the end.

3. **`<= n` in Fast Pointer Loop:**  The loop that advances the `fast` pointer is now `for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)`. This subtle change is crucial for correctly handling cases where you need to remove the very first node (when `n` equals the list length).  Without this, the code would fail in those cases.

4. **Handling `n` Greater than List Length:** The `if (fast == null)` check within the `fast` pointer advancement loop handles cases where `n` is larger than the number of nodes in the list. This gracefully handles this invalid input by returning the original list unchanged.

5. **Clearer Comments and Variable Names:** The comments and variable names are now more descriptive, making the code easier to understand.

6. **Test Cases in `main`:**  Added multiple test cases in the `main` method to demonstrate the correctness of the code, including edge cases (empty list, removing head, and `n` greater than list length).

7. **printList Helper Function:** Added a helper function to neatly print the linked list for easier testing and demonstration.



This revised code is more robust, handles edge cases correctly, and is easier to understand.
