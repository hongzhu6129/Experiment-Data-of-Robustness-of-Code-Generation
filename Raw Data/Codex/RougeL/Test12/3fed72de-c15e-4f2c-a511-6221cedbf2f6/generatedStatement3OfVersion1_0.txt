   * **Corner cases** for a modified face would include empty strings, very long strings for the facial features (to see how they affect the overall layout), and strings containing special characters that might need escaping (e.g., newline characters).



These testing strategies help ensure that the `printFace()` method behaves correctly and produces the desired output under various conditions.  While true unit tests require capturing and comparing the output, the conceptual test cases provide a good starting point for verifying the visual correctness of the output.  The example with `ByteArrayOutputStream` illustrates how to capture output for automated tests if you introduce parameters to customize the face.
