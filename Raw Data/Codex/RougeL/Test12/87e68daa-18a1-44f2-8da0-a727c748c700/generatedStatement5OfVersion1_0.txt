For this simple face-printing program, the visual inspection and file comparison tests are likely sufficient. The more advanced testing techniques become valuable as the complexity of your output and program logic increases.  Using a testing framework like JUnit (as shown in the last example) makes automated testing much easier and more robust.


**Corner Cases:**

While there aren't true "corner cases" for this specific program that would lead to unexpected behavior or errors, the concept of corner case testing is important to understand.  In a more complex drawing program, you might consider:

* **Large outputs:** If your program dynamically generated a much larger face, you might want to test performance or memory usage.
* **Invalid input:** If your program allowed customization of the face (e.g., specifying eye characters), invalid input (like extremely long strings) could be a corner case to handle.
* **Resource limitations:** If the drawing relied on external resources (e.g., loading images), you would test scenarios where those resources are unavailable or corrupt.
