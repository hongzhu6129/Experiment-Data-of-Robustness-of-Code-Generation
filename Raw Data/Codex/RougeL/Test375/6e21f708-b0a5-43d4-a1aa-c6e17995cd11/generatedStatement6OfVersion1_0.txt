**Key Improvements:**

* **Input Validation:** The `main` method now checks for:
    * Correct number of command-line arguments.
    * Whether the input is a valid positive integer.
    * Handles `NumberFormatException` if the input is not an integer.
* **Clear Usage Instructions:**  Prints a usage message if the input is incorrect.
* **`printMatrix` Method:** The `printMatrix` method is now more focused and only handles the matrix printing logic.  It receives the size `n` as input.
* **Clear Output:**  Uses `System.out.println()` to ensure each row of the matrix is printed on a new line, making the output easy to read.



Now, you have a robust and user-friendly Java program to print an n-by-n matrix!  You can change the `System.out.print("1 ")`  line in `printMatrix` to print any desired element within the matrix (e.g., `i`, `j`, a calculated value, etc.) if you need a different pattern.
