**Explanation and Enhancements:**

1. **Method Signatures:** The code adheres strictly to the provided method signatures: `public static void main(String[])` and `public static void printMatrix(int)`.

2. **Nested Loops:**  The `printMatrix` method uses nested loops to iterate through rows (outer loop `i`) and columns (inner loop `j`) of the matrix.

3. **Printing:** Inside the inner loop, `System.out.print("X ")` prints the placeholder "X" followed by a space.  You can replace "X" with:
   - `i` to display row numbers.
   - `j` to display column numbers.
   - `i * n + j` to display sequential numbers from 0 to n*n - 1.
   - Any calculated value based on `i` and `j`.

4. **Newline:** `System.out.println()` after the inner loop ensures each row is printed on a new line.

5. **Example in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to call `printMatrix` with a sample size (5 in this case). You can change this value to print matrices of different dimensions.


**Example Output (with "X"):**

If `n = 5`, the output will be:
