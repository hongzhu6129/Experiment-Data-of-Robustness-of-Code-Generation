Key improvements in this version:

* **Input Validation:**  It now includes error handling using a `try-catch` block to catch `DateTimeParseException`. This prevents the program from crashing if the user enters an invalid date format.  It provides a helpful error message.
* **Clearer Prompts:**  The input prompts are more specific, asking for dates in "yyyy-MM-dd" format.
* **`java.time` API:** It uses the modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8), which is preferred over the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes.  `LocalDate` and `Period` make date calculations much cleaner.
* **Direct Calculation:** Uses `Period.between()` for direct calculation of the difference, simplifying the logic.
