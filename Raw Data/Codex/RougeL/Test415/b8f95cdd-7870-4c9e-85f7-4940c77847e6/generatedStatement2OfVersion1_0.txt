**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The `polyEval` method efficiently implements Horner's method for polynomial evaluation.  This method minimizes the number of multiplications required, making it faster than a naive approach.

2. **Clearer Coefficient Handling:** The coefficients are stored in a `List<Double>`.  This allows for polynomials of any degree.  The order of coefficients in the list corresponds to the powers of x (from constant term to the highest power).

3. **Iterative Approach:** The `polyEval` method uses a simple `for` loop to iterate through the coefficients in reverse order, applying Horner's rule.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to create a list of coefficients and call the `polyEval` function.  It also prints the result to the console.


**How Horner's Method Works (in `polyEval`):**

Let's take the example polynomial -19 + 7x - 4x^2 + 6x^3 and x = 3:

1. **Initialization:** `result = 0`
2. **Iteration 1 (i = 3):** `result = (0 * 3) + 6 = 6`
3. **Iteration 2 (i = 2):** `result = (6 * 3) + (-4) = 18 - 4 = 14`
4. **Iteration 3 (i = 1):** `result = (14 * 3) + 7 = 42 + 7 = 49`
5. **Iteration 4 (i = 0):** `result = (49 * 3) + (-19) = 147 - 19 = 128`

So, the final result is 128, which is the correct evaluation of the polynomial at x = 3.
