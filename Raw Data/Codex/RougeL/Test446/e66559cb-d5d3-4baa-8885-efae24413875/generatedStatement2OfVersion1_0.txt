Key improvements in this version:

* **BigDecimal for Accuracy:** Uses `BigDecimal` to handle rounding, avoiding floating-point precision issues that can occur with `Math.round()` or `DecimalFormat`.
* **HALF_UP Rounding:**  Uses `RoundingMode.HALF_UP` which is the standard rounding mode (rounds towards the nearest neighbor, and if equidistant, rounds away from zero).
* **Error Handling:**  Includes a `try-catch` block to handle `NumberFormatException` which can occur if the program arguments provided by the user aren't valid numbers. Also handles `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if arguments are missing. This makes the program more robust.
* **Clearer Example Usage:** Provides multiple examples demonstrating the function with different inputs, including negative numbers and rounding to 0 decimal places.
* **User Input and Error Messages:** Accepts input from the command line (program arguments) for the number and decimal places. Provides helpful error messages and usage instructions if the input is invalid.
* **Exit code:** Now uses `System.exit(1)` to signal an error when the input is incorrect. This allows scripts or other programs that call this Java program to detect and handle failures properly.


This revised version addresses the limitations of using `DecimalFormat` or `Math.round()` and provides a more robust and accurate solution for rounding floating-point numbers.
