Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:** The code now checks for `null` or empty strings and `n <= 0`, preventing errors.
* **Distributes remainder:**  The extra characters are distributed as evenly as possible among the parts.
* **Clearer output:** The `main` method includes examples and labels the output for better understanding.
* **More robust:**  Uses `substring` properly to avoid potential `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
