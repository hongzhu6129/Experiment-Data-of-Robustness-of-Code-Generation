**Explanation and Example:**

1. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - This is the entry point of the program. 
   - It calls `permutationWithRepeation()` with the input string.

2. **`permutationWithRepeation(String str)`:**
   - This method initializes the recursive process by calling `showPermutation()` with the input string and an empty prefix.

3. **`showPermutation(String str, String prefix)`:**
   - This is the recursive method that generates and prints the permutations.
   - **Base Case:** When the length of the `prefix` equals the length of the input `str`, it means a complete permutation has been formed.  The `prefix` is printed, and the function returns.
   - **Recursive Step:**  It iterates through each character of the input `str`. In each iteration, it adds the current character to the `prefix` and makes a recursive call to `showPermutation()` with the same input string and the extended `prefix`.  This explores all possible combinations with repetition.

**Example with "abc" as input:**

The recursion unfolds like this (simplified):

1. `showPermutation("abc", "")`
2. `showPermutation("abc", "a")`
3. `showPermutation("abc", "aa")`
4. `showPermutation("abc", "aaa")`  (Prints "aaa")
5. `showPermutation("abc", "aab")`  (Prints "aab")
6. `showPermutation("abc", "aac")`  (Prints "aac")
7. ... and so on until all combinations like "bbb", "abc", "cab", "ccc" are printed.


**Key point about Repetition:**  Notice how in the recursive step, we always pass the original `str` in the recursive call. This is what allows characters to be repeated. For example,  `showPermutation("abc", "a")` can lead to `showPermutation("abc", "aa")` because we are picking from the original "abc" again, allowing 'a' to be selected a second time.
