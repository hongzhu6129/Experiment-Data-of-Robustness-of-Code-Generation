**Test Cases:**

**Corner Cases:**

* **Empty feedback string:** The program should handle an empty feedback string by returning an empty HashMap.
* **Feedback string with only special characters:** The program should ignore special characters and return a HashMap with empty counts.

**Positive Test Cases:**

* **Feedback string with one word:** The program should count the single word and return a HashMap with a count of 1.
* **Feedback string with multiple words, including duplicates:** The program should count all words, including duplicates, and return a HashMap with the corresponding counts.
* **Feedback string with special characters:** The program should ignore special characters and count only the words, returning a HashMap with the correct counts.

**Negative Test Cases:**

None, since the program is designed to handle any valid feedback string.
