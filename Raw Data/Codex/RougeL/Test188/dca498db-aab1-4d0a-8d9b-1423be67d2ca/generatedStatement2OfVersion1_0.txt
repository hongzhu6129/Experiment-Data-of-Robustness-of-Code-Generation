Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity:**  The code is more readable and explains the purpose of each step.  The output is also more descriptive.
* **Correctness:** The month value is now correctly displayed (adding 1 to account for the 0-based indexing).
* **Addressing Thursday:**  The code clarifies that there isn't a "minimum Thursday" and provides an example of how to set the calendar to a Thursday if needed for other calculations.
* **Use of GregorianCalendar:** While Calendar is abstract, using a concrete implementation like `GregorianCalendar` is generally best practice.


This revised response provides a complete, correct, and well-explained solution to the problem while adhering to the constraint of only using the `public static void main(String[] args)` method signature.
