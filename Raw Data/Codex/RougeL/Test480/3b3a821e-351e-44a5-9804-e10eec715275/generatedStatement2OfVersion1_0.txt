Key improvements:

* **Handles empty arrays:**  Added a check at the beginning of `removeDuplicates` to correctly handle empty input arrays.
* **Clearer variable names:**  Used `uniqueCount` instead of just `count` for better readability.
* **Comprehensive test cases:** Included examples in `main` with empty array, already unique array, and the given test cases to demonstrate the function's robustness.
* **Output formatting:**  Used `Arrays.copyOfRange` and `Arrays.toString` to print only the relevant part of the modified array after removing duplicates. This avoids displaying the leftover original elements that are no longer part of the unique section.
