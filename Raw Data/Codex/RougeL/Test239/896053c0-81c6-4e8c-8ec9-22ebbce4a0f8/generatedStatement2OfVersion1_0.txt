Key improvements:

* **Adjusted Stripe Length:** The length of the stripe section (`==...`) was adjusted to 32 characters to create a more rectangular flag shape and match the given example output more closely.
* **Spacing:** The spacing was fine-tuned to maintain correct alignment and proportions.
* **Loop Counts:** The loop counts were corrected to print the accurate number of star and stripe rows as per the desired output (5 star rows alternating with stripes, followed by 6 stripes).
* **Clarity and Readability:** Added some extra spacing and comments to make the code slightly easier to understand.


This revised code should produce a much better representation of the American flag when run.
