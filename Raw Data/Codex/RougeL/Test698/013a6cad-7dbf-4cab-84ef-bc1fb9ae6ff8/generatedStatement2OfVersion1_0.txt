Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature:** The `Saddleback` method now clearly takes the 2D array, its dimensions (m and n), and the target value as input.  It returns an `int[]` representing the row and column index (or {-1, -1} if not found).

2. **Saddleback Search Implementation:** The core logic of the Saddleback (or Staircase) search is implemented correctly.  It starts from the top-right corner of the matrix and efficiently eliminates rows or columns based on the comparison with the target.

3. **Return Array for Coordinates:**  The method returns an `int[]` containing the row and column indices. This is a better approach than just printing the values within the `Saddleback` function, as it keeps the searching logic separate from output.

4. **Handling Target Not Found:** The method returns `{-1, -1}` if the target is not found.  This is a standard way to signal an unsuccessful search.

5. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function, including how to handle the returned array and print the results or a "not found" message.

6. **More Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method includes two test cases to demonstrate finding a target and the behavior when a target is not present.


This improved version provides a more robust, reusable, and well-structured implementation of the Saddleback search algorithm.
