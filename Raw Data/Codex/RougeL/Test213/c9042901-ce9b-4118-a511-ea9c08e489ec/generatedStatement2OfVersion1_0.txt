**Test Cases:**

**1. Basic Case:**
   - Input: {1, 2, 3, 4} (as in the code)
   - Expected Output: 24 unique three-digit numbers (4 * 3 * 2 = 24 permutations) and the numbers themselves printed.  Verify that all numbers are unique and within the range 123 to 432.


**2. Repeated Digits:**
   - Input: {1, 1, 2, 3}
   - Expected Output: 12 unique numbers.  The repetition of '1' reduces the number of unique permutations.  Ensure that no number contains two '1's next to each other.


**3. Fewer Digits:**
   - Input: {1, 2, 3}
   - Expected Output: 6 unique three-digit numbers (3 * 2 * 1 = 6). All permutations of 1, 2, and 3.


**4. More Digits (Corner Case -  Won't affect the output significantly):**
   - Input: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   - Expected Output: Still 24 unique three-digit numbers. The program only uses the first four digits because it's designed for three-digit numbers. This tests robustness to slightly incorrect input.



**5.  Empty Input (Corner Case - Should handle gracefully):**
   - Input: {}
   - Expected Output:  0 unique numbers. No output or a clear message indicating no valid input.  The program should not crash.
