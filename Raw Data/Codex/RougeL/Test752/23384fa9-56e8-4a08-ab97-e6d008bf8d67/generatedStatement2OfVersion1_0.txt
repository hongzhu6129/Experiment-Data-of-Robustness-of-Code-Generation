This improved code handles edge cases correctly (e.g., if n is 0, 1, or 2) and adds clarity by:

* Using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `li` instead of `next`).
* Adding comments to explain the logic.
* Formatting the output for better readability.  
* Including a Fibonacci comparison, while noting it is an addition.


This prints the first `n` Lucas numbers and, for comparison, the first `n` Fibonacci numbers, clearly labeled.
