**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Empty and Null Arrays:**  The `streamAvg` method now explicitly checks for `null` and empty arrays to prevent `NullPointerException` and division by zero errors, providing more robust error handling. It prints a message indicating when no numbers are provided.

2. **Uses Arrays.stream for Summation:** The code uses `Arrays.stream` to efficiently calculate the sum of the elements in the array. This is generally more concise and readable than manually iterating through the array.

3. **Simplified `getAvg`:** The `getAvg` method now takes the sum and the count as parameters and returns their quotient as the average. The placeholder parameter is maintained to satisfy the specified method signature.

4. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly labels the results as "Average:" to make the output more informative.

5. **Multiple Test Cases:**  The `main` method includes several test cases, including different arrays, an empty array, and a `null` array, to demonstrate the error handling and functionality of the code.


This improved version is much more robust, readable, and adheres to best practices. It utilizes Java's stream API where appropriate for clarity and efficiency.
