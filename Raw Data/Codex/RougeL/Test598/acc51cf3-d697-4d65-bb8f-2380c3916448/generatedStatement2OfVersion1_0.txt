Explanation:

1. **`public static void main(String[] args)`:**
   - This is the main method where the program execution begins.
   - We create a `TreeMap` with a custom `Comparator` object.

2. **`public int compare(String s1, String s2)` (inside StringComparator):**
   - This method is part of the `Comparator` interface. It defines the logic for comparing two strings (`s1` and `s2`).
   - In this example, `s2.compareTo(s1)` is used. The `compareTo()` method of String returns:
     - A negative integer if `s2` is lexicographically less than `s1`.
     - Zero if `s2` is equal to `s1`.
     - A positive integer if `s2` is lexicographically greater than `s1`.
   - By reversing the order in the `compareTo` call (using `s2` then `s1`), we ensure the keys are sorted in *descending* order in the `TreeMap`.


Key improvements in this version:

- **Clearer Explanation:**  Comments explain the code's purpose and the logic behind the comparison.
- **Nested Comparator Class:** The `StringComparator` is now an inner class within the `TreeMapSortKeys` class, making it more organized.
- **Example of Different Comparator:** The code now demonstrates how to create a `TreeMap` with a different `Comparator` (for ascending, case-insensitive sorting), illustrating flexibility.
- **More Concise and Readable:**  Improved formatting and variable names enhance readability.
