Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Empty Array:**  Added a check at the start of `removeDuplicates` to handle the case where the input array is empty. This prevents potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. **Clearer Variable Name:** Renamed `j` to `uniqueIndex` for better readability. This variable represents the index where the next unique element should be placed.

3. **In-place Modification:** The function modifies the original array `nums` directly, as the prompt suggests.  The unique elements are moved to the beginning of the array.

4. **Return Value:** The function returns the length of the updated array (the number of unique elements), which is `uniqueIndex + 1`.

5. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes several test cases, including an empty array, an array with no duplicates, and arrays with various duplicate patterns, demonstrating the correctness of the code.

6. **Output Formatting:** The `main` method uses `Arrays.toString(Arrays.copyOfRange(nums, 0, len))` to neatly print only the relevant part of the modified array (up to the new length) , avoiding printing the remaining elements that are no longer considered part of the updated array.  This makes the output much clearer and easier to interpret.
