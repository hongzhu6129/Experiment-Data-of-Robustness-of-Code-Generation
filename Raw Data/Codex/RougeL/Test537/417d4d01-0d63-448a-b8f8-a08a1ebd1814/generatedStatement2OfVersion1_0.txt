This improved example demonstrates:

1. **Removing by Value:** Using `remove(Object o)` to remove a specific element.  It handles the case where the element might not be present.
2. **Removing by Index:** Using `remove(int index)` to remove an element at a given index. Includes error handling for `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
3. **Handling Duplicates:**  Shows how `removeFirstOccurrence(Object o)` and `removeLastOccurrence(Object o)` can be used when you have duplicate elements and want to remove specific instances.
4. **Clearer Output:** Provides more informative output to show the state of the list at each step.


Remember to import `java.util.LinkedList` at the top of your file.
