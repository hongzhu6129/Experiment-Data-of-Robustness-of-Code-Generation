Key improvements in this version:

* **Uses `Collections.swap()`:** This is the most concise and efficient way to swap elements in a `List` (including `LinkedList`). It handles the swapping internally without manual get/set operations.
* **Input Validation:**  The code now checks if the provided indices are valid (within the bounds of the list) before attempting the swap, preventing potential `IndexOutOfBoundsException` errors.
* **Clearer Output:** The output messages now clearly indicate the original list and the list after swapping.
* **Example with Integers:**  Demonstrates how to use the same logic with a `LinkedList` of a different data type (integers).


This revised answer directly addresses the prompt's requirement to use only the `main` method while providing a more robust and efficient solution.
