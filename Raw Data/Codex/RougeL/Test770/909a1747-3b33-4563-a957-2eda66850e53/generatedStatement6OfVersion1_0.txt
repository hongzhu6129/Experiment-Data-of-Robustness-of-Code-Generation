   Then examine `output.txt` to ensure the tabs and newlines are written correctly.




In a more complex program where the poem's text might be loaded from a file or a database, you would need to add tests for:

* **File Not Found:**  Handle the case where the input file doesn't exist gracefully.
* **Invalid File Format:** Test with incorrectly formatted input files (e.g., missing newlines).
* **Empty File:**  Test with an empty input file.
* **Large File:** Test with a large file to ensure performance isn't significantly impacted.
* **Database Errors:** If the poem were stored in a database, you would simulate database connection errors and test error handling.



Since this example is quite simple, the visual inspection of the output covers the essential aspects.  The more complex your program becomes, the more thorough your testing strategy should be.
