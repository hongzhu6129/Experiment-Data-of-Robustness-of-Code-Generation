**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Input (n) | Expected Output | Reason/Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 |  0 + 00 + 000 = 0 |
| 1 | 123 | 1 + 11 + 111 = 123 |
| 5 | 615 | 5 + 55 + 555 = 615 |
| 9 | 1107 | 9 + 99 + 999 = 1107 |
| -1 | Exception |  Input validation should throw an exception (or handle it appropriately) |
| 10 | Exception | Input validation should throw an exception |



**How to Run the Test Cases (Example):**

While you could manually enter these inputs, a more robust approach would be to create automated tests (using JUnit, for example). Here�s a basic example to get you started with JUnit:
