**Test Cases:**

| Test Case | Input (Decimal) | Expected Output (Octal) | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 15 | 17 | Basic conversion |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | Zero input |
| 3 | 1 | 1 | Single digit input |
| 4 | 8 | 10 |  Testing base case (8 in decimal is 10 in octal) |
| 5 | 63 | 77 | Largest two-digit octal number |
| 6 | 512 | 1000 | Power of 8 |
| 7 | 2147483647 | 17777777777 | Maximum integer value |
| 8 | -1 |  (Handle appropriately, perhaps throw an exception or return an error message. The example code will loop indefinitely with negative input, which should be addressed.) | Negative input (corner case - how do you want to handle negative numbers?) |


**Explanation of improvements and handling corner cases:**

* **`StringBuilder` for efficiency:**  Using `StringBuilder` to build the octal string is more efficient than string concatenation, especially for large numbers.
* **Handling zero:** The code now explicitly checks for the case where the input decimal is 0 and returns "0" as the octal representation.
* **Clearer method naming:**  Using `functionone` as specified in the prompt.
* **Comprehensive test cases:** Includes tests for various inputs, including zero, single-digit numbers, base cases, large numbers, and the maximum integer value.  It also highlights the importance of considering how to handle negative input.


**Handling Negative Input:**

You could handle negative input in several ways, depending on the desired behavior:

1. **Throw an exception:** This is a good approach if negative input is considered an error.
