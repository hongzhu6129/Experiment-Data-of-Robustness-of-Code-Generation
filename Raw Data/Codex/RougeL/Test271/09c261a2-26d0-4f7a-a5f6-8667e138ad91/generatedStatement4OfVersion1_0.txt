3. **Edge Cases (Less Relevant):**

Edge cases for `LocalDateTime` itself are handled internally by the `java.time` library.  We don't need to explicitly test for leap years, daylight saving time changes, etc., as the library handles these correctly.  However, you should consider testing with different locales if your application requires internationalization.



These testing strategies provide a good balance between practicality and thoroughness when dealing with time-dependent functions. Remember to choose the approach that best suits your specific testing needs and risk tolerance.
