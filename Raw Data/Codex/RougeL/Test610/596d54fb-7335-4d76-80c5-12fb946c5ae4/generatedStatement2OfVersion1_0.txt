**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Two Pointers:** The `split_sorting_array` method uses the two-pointer technique ( `left` and `right`).  `left` starts at the beginning and `right` starts at the end of the array.

2. **Efficient Swapping:** The `swap` method is a standard and efficient way to exchange elements in the array.

3. **While Loop Condition:** The `while (left < right)` condition ensures that the pointers don't cross each other, preventing unnecessary comparisons and swaps.

4. **Inner While Loops:** The inner `while` loops efficiently skip over elements that are already in the correct position (negatives on the left, positives on the right).  This avoids unnecessary swaps and makes the code more efficient.

5. **Return the Modified Array:** The `split_sorting_array` method returns the modified `arr`.  Although the array is modified in-place (because arrays are passed by reference in Java), returning the array is generally good practice and makes the code clearer.

6. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The `main` method includes a wider variety of test cases to demonstrate the code's correctness in different scenarios, including arrays with all positive, all negative, and mixed values.  Good testing is essential.


This improved version addresses the potential inefficiencies and edge cases mentioned in the previous response and provides a more robust and effective solution.
