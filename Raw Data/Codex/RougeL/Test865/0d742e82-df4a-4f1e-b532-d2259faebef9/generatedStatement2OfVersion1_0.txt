Key Improvements:

* **`Holidays` Class:**  Encapsulates holiday-related logic in a dedicated class for better organization.
* **`HashSet` for Holidays:** Uses a `HashSet` to store holidays for efficient checking ( `contains()` is O(1) on average).
* **Static Initializer:**  The `static` block populates the `holidays` set when the class is loaded.
* **`isHoliday()` Method:** Provides a clean way to check if a date is a holiday.
* **`findNextHoliday()` Method:** Demonstrates a useful function to find the next upcoming holiday.
* **Clearer Examples in `main()`:** Provides various example usages, including creating a date, checking if a date is a holiday, and finding the next holiday.
* **Error Handling:**  Includes a check in `findNextHoliday()` to handle cases where no future holidays are found.
* **Comments:**  Added more comments to explain the code's functionality.
