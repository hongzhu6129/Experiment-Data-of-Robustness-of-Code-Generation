**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The `isCube` method now correctly handles negative numbers by checking if the absolute value of the number is a cube.

2. **Efficiency with Binary Search:** Instead of iterating up to the cube root, I've implemented a binary search approach. This significantly improves the efficiency for larger numbers.

3. **Handles Overflow with `long`:**  Cubing an `int` can quickly lead to integer overflow (exceeding the maximum `int` value).  The code uses `long` to store the cubed value (`cube`) to prevent this issue.  This is crucial for correctness.

4. **Clearer Output:** The output messages are slightly more informative.

5. **Input Handling (Optional):**  For a more complete program, you can replace the hardcoded `number = 8` with code to take user input from the console using the `Scanner` class. Example:
