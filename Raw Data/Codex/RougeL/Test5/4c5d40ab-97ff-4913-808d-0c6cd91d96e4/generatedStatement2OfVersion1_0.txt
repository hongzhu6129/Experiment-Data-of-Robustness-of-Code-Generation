Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Node Class:**  A `Node` class is defined to represent the nodes of the ternary tree. Each node stores an integer `data` and references to its `left`, `middle`, and `right` children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):**
   - **Base Case:** If `node` is `null` (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**
     - Recursively calculate the depth of the left, middle, and right subtrees.
     - Return the maximum of these depths plus 1 (to account for the current node).

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - Creates an instance of the `TernaryTreeMaxDepth` class.
   - Builds example ternary trees to demonstrate the `maxDepth` method.  I added a few more examples to test different scenarios (left-deepest, middle-deepest, and empty tree).
   - Prints the maximum depth of each tree.


Key improvements in this version:

- **Clearer Node class:** Encapsulates the node structure.
- **More comprehensive testing:** Includes examples with different tree structures and an empty tree case.
- **Concise code:** The `maxDepth` method is very efficient and readable using the `Math.max` function to simplify finding the maximum depth.  
- **Comments:**  Explanatory comments are added to help understanding.
