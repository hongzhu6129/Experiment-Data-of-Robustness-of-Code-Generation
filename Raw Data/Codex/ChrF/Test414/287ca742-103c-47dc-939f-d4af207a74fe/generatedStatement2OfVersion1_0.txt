**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Shrink Factor:** The code uses the commonly recommended shrink factor of 1.3 for calculating the gap.  This value has been empirically shown to be efficient.

2. **Minimum Gap:** The gap is ensured to be at least 1. This ensures that in the final stages, the algorithm functions like a regular bubble sort, catching any remaining small elements out of order.

3. **`swapped` Flag:**  The `swapped` boolean variable is crucial for optimization.  If no swaps occur during a pass, it means the array is already sorted, and the algorithm can terminate early.  This significantly improves performance in cases where the array is nearly sorted.

4. **Clearer Structure and Comments:** The code is well-commented and structured for readability.

5. **Adherence to Method Signatures:** The code adheres strictly to the provided method signatures `CombSort(int[])`, `swap(int[], int, int)`, and `main(String[])`.


This improved version provides a more accurate and efficient implementation of the Comb Sort algorithm while respecting the given constraints.
