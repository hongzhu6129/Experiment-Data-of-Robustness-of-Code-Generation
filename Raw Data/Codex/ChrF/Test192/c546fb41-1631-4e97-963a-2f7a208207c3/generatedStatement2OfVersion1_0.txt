Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic and potential issues.
2. **`GregorianCalendar`:**  Uses `GregorianCalendar` which is the concrete implementation typically used.
3. **Minimum Year Handling:**  The minimum year is already known (1997), so no comparison is needed.
4. **Month Indexing:** Clarified that months are 0-indexed in `Calendar`.
5. **Week of Year Caution:**  Added a cautionary note about the `WEEK_OF_YEAR` field.  Its interpretation can vary depending on locale and calendar systems, so direct comparison may not always be what you expect. If you need more consistent week calculations, consider using libraries like `java.time` (Java 8+).
6. **Direct `Math.min()`:**  Used `Math.min()` for a more concise way to get the minimum values.


If you're using Java 8 or later, consider using the `java.time` package (e.g., `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, etc.) as it provides a more modern and robust approach to date and time handling.
