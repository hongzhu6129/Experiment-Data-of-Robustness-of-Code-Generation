**Test Cases:**

1. **Positive side length:**
   - Input: `side = 5`
   - Expected Output: `64.9519` (approximately)

2. **Zero side length (corner case):**
   - Input: `side = 0`
   - Expected Output: `Error: Side length must be a positive value.` (due to the exception handling)

3. **Negative side length (corner case):**
   - Input: `side = -2`
   - Expected Output: `Error: Side length must be a positive value.` (due to the exception handling)

4. **Very small positive side length (corner case):**
   - Input: `side = 0.001`
   - Expected Output: `0.000002598` (approximately) � Tests handling of small values.

5. **Very large positive side length (corner case):**
   - Input: `side = 10000`
   - Expected Output: `259807621.1353316` (approximately) � Tests handling of large values.



**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You can manually enter these values when prompted by the program.  For more automated testing, you could create a separate test class (best practice) using a testing framework like JUnit:
