Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Recursion:** The `maxDepth` method uses recursion to calculate the depth. The base case is when the `node` is `null` (empty subtree), returning 0.  Otherwise, it recursively calculates the depth of the left, middle, and right subtrees and returns the maximum of those depths plus 1 (for the current node).

2. **Comprehensive `main` method:** The `main` method now includes several test cases:
   - A basic ternary tree.
   - A tree with different depths in different branches.
   - An empty tree.
   - A tree with a single node. This helps demonstrate the correctness of the `maxDepth` method in various scenarios.

3. **`Node` class:** The `Node` class encapsulates the structure of a node in the ternary tree.  It has a `data` field and `left`, `mid`, and `right` pointers to its children.

4. **Conciseness and Readability:**  The code is written in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand and follow.  Good variable names and comments further enhance readability.
