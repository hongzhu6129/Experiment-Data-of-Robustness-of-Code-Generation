Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles `null` inputs:**  It now checks for `null` values for `mainString` and `removeString` and returns the original string if either is `null`.  This prevents `NullPointerExceptions`. You could also modify it to throw an exception if `null` is not acceptable input.
* **Clearer Examples:** The `main` method provides multiple test cases, demonstrating how the `removeString` method behaves with different inputs, including cases where the `removeString` is not found and when it appears multiple times.
* **More Robust:**  The use of `String.replace()` is a more reliable way to remove all occurrences of a substring than manually iterating or using `String.replaceAll()` (which involves regular expressions and can be less efficient for simple string replacements).
* **Better Explanation:** Comments and output demonstrations make the code's behavior clearer.
