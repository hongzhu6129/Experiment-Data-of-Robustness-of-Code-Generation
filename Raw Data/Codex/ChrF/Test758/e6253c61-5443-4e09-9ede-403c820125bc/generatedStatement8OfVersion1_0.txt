   - **How to test:**  Run and verify the Unicode characters are displayed correctly. Ensure your console or output environment supports the required encoding (usually UTF-8).

4. **System.out Error Handling (Advanced):** (While unlikely, it's theoretically possible)

   - Although extremely rare in normal circumstances, you could simulate a `System.out` error (e.g., by closing `System.out` in a separate thread before the print statements execute � don't do this in production!).
   - **Expected Behavior:** You should expect either an exception to be thrown or the output to be suppressed. The precise behavior might be platform-dependent.
   - **How to test:** This would require more advanced techniques like using a separate thread to manipulate `System.out` and using a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions.  This is mostly an academic exercise for this simple program, but a valuable concept for more complex I/O operations.


For this simple "Hello, World" type program, the first three tests are more than sufficient. The last one is more for illustrative purposes to show a more comprehensive approach to testing that would be relevant for programs with more complex I/O.
