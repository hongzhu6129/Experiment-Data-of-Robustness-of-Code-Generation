Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Empty or Null Array:**  Added a check at the beginning of `exponentialSearch` to handle cases where the input array is `null` or empty. This prevents `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. **Clearer Range Calculation:**  The range calculation for the binary search is simplified and made more robust using  `Math.min(i, n - 1)` and `Math.min(i, n)`.  This ensures we don't go beyond the array bounds, especially if `i` becomes larger than the array size.  Using `n - 1` in the starting index is because  `Arrays.binarySearch` expects the *toIndex* to be exclusive.

3. **Direct Binary Search Integration:** Uses `Arrays.binarySearch()` directly for the binary search part, which is more efficient and concise than implementing binary search manually.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method now includes test cases to demonstrate the functionality with:
   - Element present in the array
   - Element not present in the array
   - Empty array



This improved version is more robust, efficient, and adheres to best practices.
