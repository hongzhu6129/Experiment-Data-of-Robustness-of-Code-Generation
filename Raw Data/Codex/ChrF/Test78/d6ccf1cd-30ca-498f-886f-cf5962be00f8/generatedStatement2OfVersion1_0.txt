**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Saddleback Search Algorithm:** The `Saddleback` (or Saddleback Search) method efficiently searches a sorted 2D array.  It starts from the top-right corner.
   - If the current element is equal to the target, the search is successful.
   - If the current element is smaller than the target, move down to the next row (because elements increase as you move down).
   - If the current element is larger than the target, move left to the previous column (because elements decrease as you move left).

2. **Return an `int[]`:** The `Saddleback` method now returns an `int[]` of size 2.  The array contains the row and column indices of the target if found. If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.  This is a standard way to indicate that the element is not present.

3. **Clearer Main Method:** The `main` method is more concise and demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` method and interpret its results.

4. **Error Handling:**  The `main` method now checks the result from `Saddleback` and prints an appropriate message whether the element is found or not.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SaddlebackSearch.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:
