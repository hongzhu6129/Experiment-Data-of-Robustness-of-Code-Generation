Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `m` and `n` are used for rows and columns, making the code easier to follow.

2. **Return an Array for Coordinates:** The `Saddleback` function now returns an `int[]` to store both row and column indices. This is cleaner than using separate variables or printing directly from within the function.  `{-1, -1}` is returned if the target is not found.

3. **Boundary Checks:** Explicit checks `row < m` and `col >= 0`  in the `while` loop condition prevent potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

4. **Concise Return:** The code now uses `new int[]{row, col}` for a more compact and efficient way to return the coordinates.

5. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function and handles the case where the target is not found. I've added a second example to test this case explicitly.


This revised code provides a robust and efficient implementation of the Saddleback search algorithm for sorted 2D arrays in Java.
