Key improvements in this version:

- **Clearer Helper Function:** The `containsDigit7` function is now private and clearly named, improving readability and encapsulation.
- **Comprehensive Tests in `main`:** The `main` method now includes several test cases with different inputs, including numbers containing 7 and a larger input (1000) to demonstrate correctness more robustly.
- **Comments:**  Added more comments to explain the purpose of the code and methods.
- **Efficiency:** The core logic is already fairly efficient for moderate values of `n`, though for extremely large ranges, further optimizations using number theory might be explored.  However, the prompt explicitly asked to only use the two specified method signatures, so I have maintained this simplicity and clarity in the solution.
