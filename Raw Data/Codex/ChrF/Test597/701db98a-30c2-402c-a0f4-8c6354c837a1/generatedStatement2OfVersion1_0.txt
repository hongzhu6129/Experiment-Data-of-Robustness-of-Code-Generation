**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Same Coordinates:**
   - lat1 = 45, lon1 = 90
   - lat2 = 45, lon2 = 90
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

2. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1 = 90, lon1 = 0    (North Pole)
   - lat2 = -90, lon2 = 0   (South Pole)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (half the Earth's circumference)

3. **Opposite sides of the Earth (Antipodes):**
   - lat1 = 45, lon1 = 0
   - lat2 = -45, lon2 = 180
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km

4. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1 = 0, lon1 = 0
   - lat2 = 0, lon2 = 90
   - Expected Distance: ~10007.54 km (quarter of the Earth's circumference at the equator)

5. **Small Distance:**
   - lat1 = 40.7128, lon1 = -74.0060 (New York City)
   - lat2 = 34.0522, lon2 = -118.2437 (Los Angeles)
   - Expected Distance: ~3935.75 km (This is an approximate real-world example)


6. **Near the International Date Line:**
   - lat1 = 0, lon1 = 179
   - lat2 = 0, lon2 = -179
   - Expected Distance: ~222.64 km  (The distance should be small, not a huge jump)

7. **Invalid Input (latitude out of range):**
   - lat1 = 100, lon1 = 0 //Latitude should be between -90 and +90.
   - lat2 = 45, lon2= 0
   - Expected:  The program should gracefully handle this either by throwing an exception or printing an error message and exiting (or prompting the user to re-enter valid input).  You could add input validation to your code.

8. **Zero Longitude and Latitude:**
    - lat1 = 0, lon1 = 0
    - lat2 = 30, lon2 = 45
    - Expected:  Calculate the distance correctly. This tests the handling of zero values.



These test cases help to ensure that the `EarthDistance` program correctly calculates distances across various locations on Earth, including edge cases and potential error scenarios. You can add these tests to a testing framework (like JUnit) for automated testing in your Java project.
