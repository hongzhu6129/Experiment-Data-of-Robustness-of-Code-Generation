**Explanation of Test Cases:**

* **`testDifferentLengths()`:**  Tests the core functionality with strings of different lengths, ensuring the correct combination.
* **`testNullInput()`:** Covers the corner case where one or both input strings are `null`.  These should throw `IllegalArgumentException`.
* **`testEqualLengths()`:** Tests the scenario where the strings have equal lengths, which should also throw `IllegalArgumentException`.
* **`testEmptyString()`:** Tests cases where one of the strings is empty.  This checks that the empty string is correctly identified as the shorter string.
* **`testWhitespaceStrings()`:** Tests strings containing only whitespace. This ensures that whitespace is handled correctly and not treated as empty strings.


This improved version provides more comprehensive testing and handles edge cases, making it more robust.  The use of JUnit makes the testing process more organized and automated.
