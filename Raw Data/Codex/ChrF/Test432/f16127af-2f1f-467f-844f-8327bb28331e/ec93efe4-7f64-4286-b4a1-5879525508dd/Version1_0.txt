```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        double num1 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        double num2 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Sum: " + (num1 + num2));
        System.out.println("Difference (num1 - num2): " + (num1 - num2));
        System.out.println("Product: " + (num1 * num2));


        if (num2 != 0) {
            System.out.println("Quotient: " + (num1 / num2));
            System.out.println("Remainder: " + (num1 % num2));
        } else {
            System.out.println("Division by zero is not allowed.");
            // In a real application, you might throw an exception here.
        }

         input.close(); // Close the scanner to prevent resource leaks
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 2 | -5 | 2 | -3 | -7 | -10 | -2.5 | -1 |
| 3 | 0 | 10 | 10 | -10 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 7 | 0 | 7 | 7 | 0 | "Division by zero" | "Division by zero" |  *(Corner Case: Division by zero)*
| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | "Division by zero" | "Division by zero" | *(Corner Case: Both numbers zero, division by zero)*
| 6 | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13 | 8 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0 | *(Handles decimals)*
| 7 | -2.5 | -1.5 | -4 | -1 | 3.75 | 1.666... | -1  (approx, due to floating-point limitations)
| 8 | Integer.MAX_VALUE | 1 | Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1 (overflow) | Integer.MAX_VALUE -1 | Integer.MAX_VALUE | Integer.MAX_VALUE | 0 | *(Corner Case: Integer overflow on addition/multiplication)*
| 9 | Integer.MIN_VALUE | -1 | Integer.MIN_VALUE -1 (underflow) | Integer.MIN_VALUE + 1 | Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1 (overflow) | Integer.MIN_VALUE | 0|  *(Corner Case: Integer underflow/overflow)*



**How to Run Test Cases:**

While you could manually input these test cases, it's much more efficient (and less prone to errors) to automate testing.  Here are some ways:

1. **Unit Testing (Recommended):** Use a testing framework like JUnit. Create a separate test class where you write test methods to assert the expected outputs against the actual outputs of your `ArithmeticOperations` class.

2. **Input Redirection:** You can create a text file with the input values and redirect it to the standard input of your program.  For example:

   ```bash
   java ArithmeticOperations < input.txt > output.txt
   ```

   Then, compare the `output.txt` with your expected output.

3. **Scanner Modification (Less Recommended):** For simple testing within the `main` method itself, you could temporarily modify your code to read from an array of test cases instead of `System.in`.


Using a testing framework like JUnit is the standard and most robust approach, especially as your program grows in complexity. It allows you to easily run and manage a suite of tests, automate assertions, and generate test reports.
