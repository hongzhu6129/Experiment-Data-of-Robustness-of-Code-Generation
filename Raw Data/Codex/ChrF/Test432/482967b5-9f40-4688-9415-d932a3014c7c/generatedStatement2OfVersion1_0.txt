**Test Cases:**

**Normal Cases:**

1. **Fraction 1:** 1/2, **Fraction 2:** 1/4
   - Addition: 3/4
   - Subtraction: 1/4
   - Multiplication: 1/8
   - Division: 2/1 (or 2)
   - Remainder of numerators: 1

2. **Fraction 1:** 3/5, **Fraction 2:** 2/3
   - Addition: 19/15
   - Subtraction: -1/15
   - Multiplication: 6/15 = 2/5 (simplified)
   - Division: 9/10
   - Remainder of numerators: 1


**Corner Cases:**

1. **Zero Denominator:**  
   - **Fraction 1:** 1/0, **Fraction 2:** Any � Should print "Error: Denominator cannot be zero."
2. **Division by Zero:**
   - **Fraction 1:** Any, **Fraction 2:** 0/Any  � Should print "Error: Cannot divide by zero." or "Error: Cannot calculate remainder with a divisor of zero." (depending on which operation).
3. **Large Numbers:**
   - **Fraction 1:** 12345/67890, **Fraction 2:** 98765/43210 � Test for potential integer overflow issues (though with int, overflow is likely).
4. **Negative Numbers:** 
   - **Fraction 1:** -2/3, **Fraction 2:** 4/5 � Ensure correct handling of signs.
5. **Whole Numbers:**
   - **Fraction 1:** 4/1 (or just 4 entered), **Fraction 2:** 2/1 � Make sure simplification returns a whole number like "4" instead of "4/1."


6. **Remainder with Zero Divisor**
   - **Fraction 1:** 5/3, **Fraction 2:** 0/4 - Should print "Error: Cannot calculate remainder with a divisor of zero".


By running these test cases, you can ensure that the program handles various inputs correctly, including error conditions and simplified results.
