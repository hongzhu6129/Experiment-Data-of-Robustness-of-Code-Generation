**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Encapsulation:** The `Rectangle` class now has private `length` and `width` fields and public methods (`getArea`, `getPerimeter`) to access and calculate values. This is good object-oriented practice.

2. **JUnit Tests:**  I've added JUnit 5 tests to thoroughly verify the `getArea` and `getPerimeter` methods.  Testing is crucial for ensuring correctness.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The tests now include corner cases:
   - Zero length
   - Zero width
   - Both length and width zero
   - A square (a special case of a rectangle)

4. **Clearer Main Method:** The `main` method provides a couple of example usages.

**How to Run the Tests:**

If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you can right-click on the test class or methods and select "Run".  If you're using the command line:

1. Compile: `javac Rectangle.java RectangleTest.java`
2. Run tests: `java -cp . org.junit.platform.console.ConsoleLauncher --select-class RectangleTest` (Make sure JUnit is on your classpath).



This revised version is more robust, testable, and follows best practices for Java development. It handles the corner cases you requested and demonstrates how to use JUnit for testing.
