Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles 0 correctly:**  The previous version had an issue where an input of `0` or numbers that resulted in intermediate calculations of `0` would cause problems. This version explicitly checks for a remainder of `0` and handles it appropriately by appending 'Z' and decrementing the quotient by 1.
* **Clearer logic:** The `if/else` structure makes the special handling of `0` remainder much more obvious.
* **StringBuilder for Efficiency:**  Uses `StringBuilder` instead of string concatenation for better performance, especially for larger column numbers.
* **More comprehensive test cases:**  Includes a wider range of test cases to demonstrate the code's correctness, including edge cases and larger numbers.


This improved version addresses the shortcomings of the previous versions and provides a more robust and efficient solution.
