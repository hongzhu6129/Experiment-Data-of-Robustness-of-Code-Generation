Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles the case where 10 is not present:** The code now checks if the value 10 actually exists in the original array.  If it doesn't, it prints a message indicating that. I've also included commented-out code that shows how you could create a simple copy of the original array if desired, even if 10 isn't found.
* **Clearer variable names:** `last10Index` makes the purpose of the variable more obvious.
* **More concise output:** The output is formatted better for readability.
* **No unnecessary array creation if 10 is the last element:** The code avoids creating an empty array in the case where the last element is 10. This is more efficient.  (A zero-length array was a minor edge-case issue in the previous version.)


This revised version addresses the potential issues and makes the code more robust and understandable.
