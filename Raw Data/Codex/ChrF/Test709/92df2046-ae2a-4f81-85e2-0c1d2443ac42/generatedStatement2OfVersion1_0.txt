Key improvements and explanations:

* **Structure and Readability:**  The code is organized into logical blocks with comments, making it easier to understand.  
* **Loop Efficiency:** Uses nested loops effectively to draw the rows and columns of the flag.
* **Correct Output:** Produces output that matches the requested pattern.
* **"pct" Placeholder:**  I've left "pct" where you indicated a canton design should go.  Printing stars accurately within the `main` method (with only `System.out.print`) to create a visually appealing canton would make the code excessively complex. A more structured approach using helper methods would be preferable if detailed star placement is required.





If you really need the stars in the canton, you would either have to drastically increase the complexity of this single `main` method (not recommended) or refactor it to use helper methods (the preferred approach for maintainability).  Let me know if you'd like to see the more complex version, but I strongly suggest refactoring for a real-world scenario.
