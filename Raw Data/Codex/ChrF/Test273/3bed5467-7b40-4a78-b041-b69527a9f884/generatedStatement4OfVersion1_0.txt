Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles all lowercase English alphabet characters:**  Uses an array of size 26 to store character counts.
* **Clearer variable names:**  `charCount` is more descriptive than `freq`.
* **Returns -1 if no unique character is found:** Though the prompt specifies there will always be a unique character,  it's good practice to handle edge cases, even if they are not expected.
* **Added more test cases in `main`:** Demonstrates the function's behavior with different string inputs, including cases where the unique character appears later in the string or when there are multiple unique characters (it correctly finds the *first* unique one).
* **Efficiency:**  The code is efficient, performing the task in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the string. It makes a single pass to count character frequencies and another single pass to find the first unique character.
