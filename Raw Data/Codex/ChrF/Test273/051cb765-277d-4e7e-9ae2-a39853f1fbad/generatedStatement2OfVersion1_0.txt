Key improvements:

* **Handles all lowercase English alphabet characters:** Uses an array of size 26 to efficiently store character counts.
* **Clearer variable names:** `charCounts` instead of `freq`.
* **More efficient:**  Iterates through the string only twice.
* **Handles edge cases (for completeness):** Returns -1 if no unique character is found, even though the problem statement guarantees at least one.  This makes the function more robust in general.
* **Added more test cases in `main`:**  Demonstrates the function's behavior with different inputs, including one with a unique character appearing later in the string, and the LeetCode example, plus one demonstrating what happens when there are *no* unique chars. This more thoroughly tests the code.
* **Comments:** Added comments explaining the logic.


This revised code is efficient, correct, and easier to understand.
