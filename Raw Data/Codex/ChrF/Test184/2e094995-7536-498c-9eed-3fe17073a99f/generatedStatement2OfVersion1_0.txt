Key improvements:

* **Uses `java.time`:** This is the modern Java date/time API.  It's much better than the old `Date` and `Calendar` classes.
* **Handles invalid input:** The `try-catch` block catches `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters dates in the wrong format.
* **Clearer output:**  The output is formatted more clearly, labeling the years, months, and days.
* **`Period.between()`:** This method directly calculates the difference between two `LocalDate` objects, making the code more concise and easier to understand.  It also handles the complexities of calendar calculations correctly.
* **Includes user input:** The code now prompts the user to enter the two dates.
