Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:** Uses a `try-catch` block to handle `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters dates in an incorrect format. This prevents the program from crashing.
* **Clearer Prompts:**  Provides specific instructions to the user on the expected date format.
* **Resource Management:** Closes the `Scanner` to release the resource.
* **Modern Date/Time API:** Uses `java.time` (introduced in Java 8), which is significantly better than the old `Date` and `Calendar` classes.  It's simpler, clearer, and handles time zones more effectively (though time zones aren't relevant in this specific example).
