The output will list the available character sets on your system and the results of the test cases.  The test cases are demonstrative � for proper testing, integrate with a testing framework (JUnit is recommended).


**Key Improvements over Previous Versions:**

- **No longer relies on the `CharsetEncoder` class:** The previous versions used `CharsetEncoder` unnecessarily, which made the code more complex. The `Charset.availableCharsets()` method is the correct and more straightforward approach.
- **Handles exceptions correctly:**  The `testGetCharset` function demonstrates proper exception handling.
- **More informative output:** The output clearly distinguishes between canonical and display names.
- **Clearer test cases:** The test cases are separated and more descriptive.


This revised version is more concise, efficient, and robust. It addresses the original requirements and includes valuable test cases to ensure correctness.
