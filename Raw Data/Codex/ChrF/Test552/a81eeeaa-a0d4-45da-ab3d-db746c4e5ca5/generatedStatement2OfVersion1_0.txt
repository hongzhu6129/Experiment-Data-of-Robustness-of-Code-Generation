Key improvements and explanations:

1. **BigDecimal for Accuracy:**  Using `BigDecimal` is crucial for accurate rounding, especially when dealing with potential floating-point representation issues that can arise with `double` values.

2. **RoundingMode.UP:**  Explicitly specifies rounding up, ensuring the desired behavior.

3. **Clearer Example Usage:**  Provides more example values, including one that demonstrates the importance of using `BigDecimal` (the 10.0/3.0 case).

4. **Error Handling:**  Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the input is not a valid number and `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if no command line argument is provided. It provides helpful feedback to the user and defaults to an example value.

5. **Concise Method:** The `roundUp` method is now more focused and efficient.

6. **Commented Alternative:** Shows the simpler `Math.ceil()` alternative for comparison, though `BigDecimal` is generally preferred for precision.



This improved version addresses the potential inaccuracies, provides better examples, and demonstrates robust error handling, making it a more complete and reliable solution.
