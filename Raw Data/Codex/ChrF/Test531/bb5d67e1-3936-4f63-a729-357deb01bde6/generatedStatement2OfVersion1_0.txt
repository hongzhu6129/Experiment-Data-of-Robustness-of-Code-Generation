**Test Cases (though for simple output, visual inspection is primary):**

1. **Basic Test:**  Run the program and visually verify that the output matches the expected face. This confirms the basic functionality.

2. **Character Encoding:**  Ensure the output looks correct on different systems with varying character encodings.  This is less of an issue with basic ASCII characters used here, but worth checking if you were to add more complex characters like emojis.

3. **Output Stream Redirection (Less applicable, but for completeness):** If you were using this face printing in a larger application, test redirecting the output to a file or another stream to confirm it behaves correctly. For example:
