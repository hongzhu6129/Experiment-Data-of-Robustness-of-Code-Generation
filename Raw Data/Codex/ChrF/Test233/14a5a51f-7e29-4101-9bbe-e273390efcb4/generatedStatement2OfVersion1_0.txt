Here's how this code fulfills the requirements:

1. **`public static void main(String[] args)`:** This is the main method where the program execution begins.  It handles user input, counts character occurrences, and displays the results.

2. **`private static void displayExecutionTime(long elapsedTime)`:** This method takes the elapsed time (calculated in `main`) as input and prints it to the console.

3. **Character Counting Logic:** The core logic is inside the `main` method.  It iterates through the input string and increments the `count` whenever the `targetChar` is found.

4. **User Input:**  The `Scanner` class is used to get the string and the character to search for from the user.

5. **Execution Time Measurement:** The `System.nanoTime()` method is used at the beginning and end of the core logic to measure execution time, which is then passed to `displayExecutionTime`.

6. **Resource Management:** The `scanner.close()` statement ensures proper resource management by closing the `Scanner` after it's no longer needed.
