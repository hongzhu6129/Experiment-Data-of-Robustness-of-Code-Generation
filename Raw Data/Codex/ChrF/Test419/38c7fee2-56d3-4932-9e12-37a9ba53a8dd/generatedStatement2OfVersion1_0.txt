**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Input Validation:** The code now includes a check to ensure that `k` is within a valid range (1 to the array length).  This prevents `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if `k` is out of bounds.

2. **Clearer Output:** The output messages are more descriptive, indicating the value of `k` used.

3. **`Arrays.sort()`:** Uses the built-in `Arrays.sort()` method which is generally efficient for moderate-sized arrays.

4. **Conciseness:** The code is concise and focused on the core logic.

**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `KthSmallestLargest.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:
