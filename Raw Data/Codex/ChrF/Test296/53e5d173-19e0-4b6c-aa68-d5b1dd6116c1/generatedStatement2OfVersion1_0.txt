Key improvements and explanations in the code:

* **Clearer Test Cases:**  The test cases are now separated and labeled for better readability, covering various scenarios.
* **Corner Case:** The inclusion of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` tests the swap logic with extreme values, addressing a potential overflow/underflow issue (important if you were using the addition/subtraction method).
* **Temp Variable Method is Safest:**  The primary method using a temporary variable (`temp`) is emphasized as the most reliable and generally preferred approach because it avoids potential overflow/underflow issues.
* **Alternative Methods (With Caveats):** The addition/subtraction and XOR methods are included for demonstration, but with clear warnings about potential overflow/underflow for the former.  XOR is generally safe but can be less intuitive.
* **Comments:**  More comments explain the logic and highlight potential issues.




This improved version provides a more comprehensive and robust demonstration of swapping variables in Java, including handling of corner cases and alternative approaches.
