Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:** The code now explicitly checks for `null` or empty matrices, preventing potential `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` errors.
* **Clearer variable names:** Using `rows` and `cols` instead of `m` and `n` improves readability.
* **Efficient binary search:** The code utilizes a single binary search across the entire matrix (treated as a sorted 1D array), which is more efficient than searching row by row or column by column.
* **Midpoint calculation:**  Uses `mid = left + (right - left) / 2` to prevent potential integer overflow when calculating the midpoint.
* **Comprehensive `main` method:**  Provides several test cases, including edge cases (empty matrix, null matrix), to demonstrate the functionality of the `searchMatrix` method.  This makes the code easier to understand and test.
