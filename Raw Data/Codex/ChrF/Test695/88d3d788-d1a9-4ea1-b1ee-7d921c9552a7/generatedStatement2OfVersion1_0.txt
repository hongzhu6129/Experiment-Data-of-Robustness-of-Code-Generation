This improved version includes:

* **Clearer output:**  The output now labels each ArrayList (original and reversed) to make it easy to follow.
* **String example:**  It demonstrates reversing an ArrayList of Strings as well as integers.
* **Manual reversal method:** It shows how to reverse an ArrayList *without* using `Collections.reverse()`, which can be useful for learning purposes or if you have a specific reason to avoid the built-in method. This manual method uses a two-pointer approach, swapping elements from the beginning and end of the list until it reaches the middle.
