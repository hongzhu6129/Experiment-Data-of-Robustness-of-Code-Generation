**Explanation and Handling Leading Zeros:**

1. **`countBitsTozeroBasedOnString(int n)`:**
   - Takes an integer `n` as input.
   - Converts `n` to its binary string representation using `Integer.toBinaryString(n)`.
   - Iterates through each character (bit) in the binary string.
   - Increments `zeroCount` if the character is '0'.
   - Returns the final `zeroCount`.

2. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - Provides example usage with different integer inputs.
   - Prints the number of zero bits for each example.

**Important Note about Leading Zeros:**

The `Integer.toBinaryString()` method *doesn't* include leading zeros.  If you want to consider the full 32-bit representation (including leading zeros for positive numbers), you would need to modify the code slightly.  Here's how:
