This uses `String.format("%32s", ...)` to create a 32-character string, padding with spaces as needed. Then `.replace(' ', '0')` replaces those spaces with zeros, giving you the full 32-bit representation with leading zeros.


Choose the version (with or without leading zero handling) that best suits your specific requirements. The examples in the `main` method demonstrate the difference.
