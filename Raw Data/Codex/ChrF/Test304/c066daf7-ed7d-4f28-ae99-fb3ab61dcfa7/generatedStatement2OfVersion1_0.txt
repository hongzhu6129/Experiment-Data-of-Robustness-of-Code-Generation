**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The provided computation method is known as Horner's method.  It's an efficient way to evaluate polynomials, minimizing the number of multiplications.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `coefficients` instead of `a` makes the code more self-documenting.

3. **ArrayList for Coefficients:**  Using an `ArrayList` to store the coefficients makes the code more flexible. You can easily change the polynomial by modifying the list.

4. **Reverse Iteration:**  The `polyEval` method iterates through the coefficients from highest degree to lowest (backwards through the list), directly implementing Horner's method. This eliminates the need for manual index calculations or reversed lists.

5. **Example in `main`:**  The `main` method provides a clear example of how to use the `polyEval` method, including creating a sample polynomial and evaluating it at x=3.

6. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the code's logic and purpose.

7. **Double Precision:** Using `double` for both the coefficients and `x` provides better precision for the calculation.


This improved version is more efficient, readable, and robust than a direct translation of the initial nested parentheses approach.
