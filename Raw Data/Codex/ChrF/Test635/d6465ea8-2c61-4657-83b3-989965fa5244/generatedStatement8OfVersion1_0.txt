**4. Large Integer:**  (Not a corner case in terms of program breaking, but tests for potential overflow if the data type were smaller, like `byte` or `short`.)

* **Input:** 12345
* **Expected Output:**  (Check that the results are correct for the large number.)


**5.  Input Validation (Corner Case):**

* **Input:**  "abc" (or any non-integer input)
* **Expected Behavior:** The program should handle this gracefully.  The best approach is to catch the `InputMismatchException` that the `Scanner` will throw if the input is not an integer.  A robust version of the code would include this error handling:
