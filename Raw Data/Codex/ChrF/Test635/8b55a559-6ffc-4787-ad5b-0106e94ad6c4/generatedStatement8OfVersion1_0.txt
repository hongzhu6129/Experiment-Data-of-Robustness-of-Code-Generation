4. **Large Positive Number:**  (Not a true corner case, but tests for potential overflow if you were using a smaller data type like `byte` or `short` which you are not here)
   - Input: 100000 
   - Expected Output: The table up to 100000 x 10 = 1000000

5. **Large Negative Number:** (Similar overflow check as above)
   - Input: -100000
   - Expected Output: The table up to -100000 x 10 = -1000000



**How to Run the Tests:**

1. **Manual Testing:** Run the program multiple times, entering each test case input manually and verifying the output against the expected output.

2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  You could create a testing class using a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a basic example:
