4. **Large Positive Number:**
   - Input: `100000`  (Tests for potential overflow issues if you were using smaller data types like `byte` or `short`, but `int` handles this fine)
   - Expected Output: (check a few lines to make sure the multiplication is correct)


5. **Large Negative Number:**
   - Input: `-100000`  (Similar overflow check as above)



6. **Invalid Input (Non-Integer):**
   - Input: `abc` or `3.14`
   - Expected Behavior: The program should either gracefully handle the error (e.g., using a `try-catch` block to catch `InputMismatchException`) and prompt the user again for a valid integer or terminate with an error message.  The provided code will throw an exception if the input isn't an integer.  A more robust version is below.
