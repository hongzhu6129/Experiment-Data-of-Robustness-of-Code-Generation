These test cases cover positive, negative, zero, and large magnitude integers, ensuring the program handles different input scenarios correctly.  They also implicitly test the loop logic to ensure it iterates the correct number of times.


If you were handling input from a file or other source where invalid input (non-integer) is possible, you should add error handling (a `try...catch` block) to catch `InputMismatchException` and provide appropriate feedback to the user. This makes the program more robust.
