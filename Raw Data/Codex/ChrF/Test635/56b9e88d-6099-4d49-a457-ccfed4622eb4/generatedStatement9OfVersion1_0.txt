**How to Run the Tests:**

You can manually run these tests by compiling and running the Java program, entering each input value and verifying the output against the expected results.  For more automated testing, you would use a testing framework like JUnit.  JUnit allows you to write test methods that automatically run and verify the output of your `printMultiplicationTable` function.



This enhanced set of test cases and the explanation of input validation provide a more comprehensive testing approach.  Remember to handle exceptions appropriately in your code to make it robust.
