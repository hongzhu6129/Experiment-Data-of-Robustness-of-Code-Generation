This improved version:

1. **Handles Invalid Input:** Uses a `try-catch` block to gracefully handle `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters the date in the wrong format.
2. **Clear Prompts and Output:** Provides clear instructions to the user and formats the output nicely.
3. **Uses `java.time`:** This modern Java date/time API is much preferred over older classes like `Date` and `Calendar`.  It's cleaner and easier to use.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CalculateAge.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type:  `javac CalculateAge.java`
3. **Run:**  `java CalculateAge`


The program will then prompt you to enter your birthdate.  Enter it in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 1990-05-15).  The program will then calculate and display your age.
