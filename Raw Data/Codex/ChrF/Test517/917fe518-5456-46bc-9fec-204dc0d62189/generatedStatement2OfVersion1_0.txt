This improved version:

1. **Handles invalid input:**  It uses a `try-catch` block to catch `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters the date in the wrong format. This prevents the program from crashing.
2. **Uses `java.time`:** The `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8) is the modern and preferred way to work with dates and times in Java.  It's much cleaner and easier to use than older classes like `Date` and `Calendar`.
3. **Calculates the precise age:**  `Period.between()` calculates the exact difference between two dates, including years, months, and days.
4. **Clear prompts and output:**  The program provides clear instructions to the user and displays the age in a user-friendly format.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CalculateAge.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run `javac CalculateAge.java`.
3. **Run:**  After successful compilation, run `java CalculateAge`. The program will prompt you to enter your birthdate.
