**Test Cases and Corner Cases:**

While this program doesn't have inputs that can cause logical errors (like calculations or data processing), we can still consider a few aspects for testing:

1. **Basic Functionality:**  Does the program compile and run without errors? Does it print the face as expected?  This is the most important test. Run the program and visually verify the output.

2. **Character Encoding:** Ensure the output is displayed correctly with the special characters like ", [, ], ^, -, +.  This might depend on your console or terminal's character encoding settings. Try running the program in different environments (e.g., IDE, command line) to check for discrepancies.

3. **Output Redirection:** Test redirecting the output to a file. This verifies that the program's output stream works as intended.  You can do this from the command line: `java FacePrinter > output.txt`  Then check the contents of `output.txt`.

4. **Integration (if applicable):** If this `printFace()` method were part of a larger program, you'd want to test its integration with other parts of the system.  For example, if the face was printed in response to a user action or as part of a graphical user interface, you would need to test those scenarios.


Although these tests might seem trivial for this simple program, the principles are important.  Thinking about these aspects, even for simple code, helps develop good testing habits for more complex projects.
