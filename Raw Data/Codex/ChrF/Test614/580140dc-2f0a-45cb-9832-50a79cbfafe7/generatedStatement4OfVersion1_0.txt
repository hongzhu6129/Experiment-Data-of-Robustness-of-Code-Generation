2. **Whitespace Sensitivity Test:** Pay close attention to the whitespace (tabs and newlines). Even a single incorrect space or tab will change the formatting. The test should explicitly check for the correct indentation using tabs (`\t`).


3. **Platform Independence Test (Optional but Good Practice):**  Although less critical here, it's a good idea to test on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to ensure consistent output regarding newline characters. Java handles newlines relatively well cross-platform, but variations can sometimes occur.  You could automate this with a testing framework if you had a larger project.


4. **Character Encoding Test (Optional for advanced scenarios):** If your program were to handle international characters or different encodings (like UTF-8, UTF-16), you would want to test with strings containing those characters to ensure they are printed correctly.  This is not a concern with the basic "Twinkle Twinkle" text.
