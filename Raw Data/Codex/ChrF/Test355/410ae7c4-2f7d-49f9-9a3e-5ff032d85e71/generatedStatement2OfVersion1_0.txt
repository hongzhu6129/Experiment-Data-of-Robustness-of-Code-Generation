**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`main` Method:** The `main` method now initializes a sample 2D boolean array.
2. **`printBooleanArray` Method:** This helper method iterates through the 2D array using enhanced `for` loops (also known as for-each loops).  This makes the code more concise and readable.
3. **Clear Representation:** The `printBooleanArray` method uses a ternary operator (`value ? "t " : "w "`) to print "t" for `true` and "w" for `false`, as requested in the problem description.  It also adds a space after each element for better readability.
4. **Newlines:**  A `System.out.println()` is added after each row to format the output correctly, making it a clear 2D representation.



**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.java` file (e.g., `PrintBooleanArray.java`).
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using the Java compiler:
