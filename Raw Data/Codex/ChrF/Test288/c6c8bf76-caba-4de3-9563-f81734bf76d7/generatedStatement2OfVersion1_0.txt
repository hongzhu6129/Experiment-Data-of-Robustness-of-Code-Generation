Key improvements and explanations:

* **Handles edge cases:** The `sort` method now correctly handles `null` and empty input arrays without throwing exceptions.  This makes the code more robust.
* **Clearer pivot selection:**  The pivot is now calculated as the middle element using `array[lowerIndex + (higherIndex - lowerIndex) / 2]`. This avoids potential integer overflow issues that could occur with `(lowerIndex + higherIndex) / 2` for very large arrays.
* **Improved `exchangeNumbers`:** The `exchangeNumbers` method is now more efficient and clear as it directly operates on the provided array using its indices.
* **Comprehensive testing in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates the QuickSort functionality with a sample array, an empty array, and a `null` array to show proper handling of different input scenarios.
* **Comments and formatting:** The code includes clear comments explaining the logic and proper formatting for enhanced readability.


This revised version addresses the potential issues of the previous response and provides a more robust and understandable implementation of QuickSort in Java.
