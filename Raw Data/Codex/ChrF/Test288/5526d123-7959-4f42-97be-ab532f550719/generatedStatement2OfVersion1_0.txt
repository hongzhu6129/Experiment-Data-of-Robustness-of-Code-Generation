Key improvements:

* **Clearer Pivot Selection:** Uses the middle element as the pivot to avoid worst-case scenarios with already sorted or reverse-sorted data.  `(lowerIndex + higherIndex) / 2`  can cause overflow for very large arrays. The improved version `lowerIndex + (higherIndex - lowerIndex) / 2` avoids this.
* **Handles Empty/Null Input:** Includes a check at the beginning of `sort()` to handle these cases gracefully.
* **Recursive Calls Optimized:**  The recursive calls are now properly guarded with `if` conditions to avoid unnecessary calls when sub-arrays have 0 or 1 elements.
* **Descriptive Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic more clearly.
* **Example in `main()`:** Includes an example usage and output.
* **Correctness:** Ensures the algorithm sorts correctly.


This revised version addresses the potential weaknesses of the previous implementation and provides a more robust and efficient Quick Sort implementation.
