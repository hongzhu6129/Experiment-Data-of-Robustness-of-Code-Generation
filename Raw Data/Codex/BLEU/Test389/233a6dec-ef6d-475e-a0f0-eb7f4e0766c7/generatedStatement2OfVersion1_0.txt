**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Corrected Formula:** The original prompt had a slight error in the formula (an extra + sign).  The correct alternating signs (-, +, -, +...) are implemented now.

2. **Use of Doubles:** The code explicitly uses `1.0`, `3.0`, etc. to ensure floating-point division.  If you use integers like `1/3`, Java performs integer division, which truncates the decimal part and would lead to an incorrect result.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly labels each approximation for better understanding.


**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a file named `ApproximatePi.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the command:
