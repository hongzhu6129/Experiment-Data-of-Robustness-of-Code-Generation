Explanation and improvements:

1. **Case-Insensitivity:** The code now converts both the `word` and the `item` to lowercase using `toLowerCase()` before comparison. This ensures that the check is case-insensitive, as requested in the prompt's examples (e.g., "Sun" matching "Sound" and "sunday").

2. **Character Sorting:**  The code sorts the character arrays of both `word` and `item`.  This is a crucial step to make the comparison efficient.  We only need to check if all the characters in `word` exist in `item`, not their order.

3. **Efficient Comparison:** The nested loops have been replaced with a more efficient comparison using two pointers (`i` and `j`).  This significantly improves performance, especially for longer strings.

4. **Clearer Output:** The code now prints the `item` only if it contains all the characters of `word`.

5. **Additional Test Cases:** I've included extra test cases in `main` to demonstrate the code's handling of different scenarios, including those demonstrated in the prompt.  This is good practice for thorough testing.

6. **List of Items:** The `items` are now stored in a `List<String>`, which is more flexible and scalable than using separate string variables.


This improved version addresses the issues of case sensitivity, efficiency, and provides a more robust and clear solution. It also adheres to the method signature restrictions given in the prompt.
