Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Clear Method Signature Adherence:**  The code strictly uses `static void checkExistance(String, String)` and `public static void main(String[])` as required.

2. **Improved Logic in `checkExistance`:** The method now iterates through the `languageChars` and checks if *each* character is present in the `item` string.  It uses a boolean flag `containsAll` to track whether all characters are found.  This is more efficient and accurate than previous versions.

3. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `checkExistance` method with a sample list of items and a "language" string.  The output clearly indicates which items contain all the required characters.

4. **Case Sensitivity:**  The current code is case-sensitive. If you want case-insensitive checking, you can convert both the `item` and `languageChars` to lowercase before the comparison:
