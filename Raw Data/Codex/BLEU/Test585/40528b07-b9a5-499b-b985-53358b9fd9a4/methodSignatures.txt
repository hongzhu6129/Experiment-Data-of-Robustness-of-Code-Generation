 Only use the method signatures  static BigInteger rev(BigInteger),  static Tuple lychrel(BigInteger), public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program to find the number of seed Lychrel number candidates and related numbers for n in the range 1..10000 inclusive. (With a 500-iteration limit). A Lychrel number is a natural number that cannot form a palindrome through the iterative process of repeatedly reversing its digits and adding the resulting numbers. This process is sometimes called the 196-algorithm, after the most famous number associated with the process. The first few Lychrel numbers are 196, 295, 394, 493, 592, 689, 691, 788, 790, 879, 887, ... . : 5 Lychrel seeds: [196, 879, 1997, 7059, 9999] 244 Lychrel related 5 Lychrel palindromes: [196, 879, 1997, 7059, 9999]\n\n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n
