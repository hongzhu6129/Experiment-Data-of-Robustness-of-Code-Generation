Key improvements and explanations in this code:

* **Case-Sensitivity of Environment Variables:** Environment variables are often case-sensitive (especially on Unix-like systems like Linux and macOS).  The code now correctly handles both the Windows (`Path`, `TEMP`, `USERNAME`) and Linux/macOS/etc. (`PATH`, `temp`, `USER`) versions for more robust retrieval.  It checks for common variations to be more comprehensive.

* **Clarity and Readability:** The output is formatted more clearly to indicate which environment variable is being printed.

* **Error Handling (Optional):**  If you need to handle the case where an environment variable might *not* be set, you can add a check for `null` before printing the value:
