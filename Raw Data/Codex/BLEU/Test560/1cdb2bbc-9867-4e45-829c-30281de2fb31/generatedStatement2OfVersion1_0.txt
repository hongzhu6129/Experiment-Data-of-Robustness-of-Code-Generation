Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is now well-formatted and easier to understand.  Comments explain the logic.
* **Efficiency:** Using a `HashSet` (as opposed to a `List`) to store seen numbers significantly improves efficiency when checking if a number has already occurred in the sequence. `HashSet` has O(1) average time complexity for `contains()`, while `List` has O(n).
* **Helper Function:** The `sumOfSquaresOfDigits` function makes the code cleaner and more modular.
* **Correctness:** The logic accurately determines happy and unhappy numbers.
* **Main Method with Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates the usage of the `isHappy_number` function with clear examples and output.
