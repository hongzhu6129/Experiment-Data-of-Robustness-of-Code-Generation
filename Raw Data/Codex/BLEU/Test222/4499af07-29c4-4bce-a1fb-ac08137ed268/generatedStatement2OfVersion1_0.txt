Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Case-Insensitive Counting:**  The `CountCharacters` method now converts the input string to lowercase using `str.toLowerCase()` to ensure that 'P' and 'p' are considered the same character.
2. **Clearer Output:** Added a newline character (`System.out.println()`) after printing the duplicates to separate the output for different input strings.  Also added a "No duplicates found" message for clarity.
3. **Handles Non-Letters:** Includes `Character.isLetter(c)` in `CountCharacters` to only count letters.  This avoids potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` errors if the input string has characters outside the 'a'-'z' range.
4. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates the functionality with various examples, including strings with uppercase characters, no duplicates, and strings containing spaces.


This improved version addresses potential issues, handles various input scenarios more robustly, and produces clearer output.
