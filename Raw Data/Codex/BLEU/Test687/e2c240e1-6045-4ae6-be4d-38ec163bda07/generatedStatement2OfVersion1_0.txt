Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is now well-commented and follows standard Java naming conventions.
* **Efficiency:** The `generatePrimes` function is optimized. We only iterate up to the square root of `n` in the outer loop, which is a standard optimization for the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
* **Correctness:** The code accurately handles edge cases and produces the correct output.
* **Conciseness:** The logic is expressed clearly and concisely.
* **Output Formatting:** The output is formatted to clearly indicate what the program is doing.  A newline is added for better readability.


This improved version is more efficient, easier to understand, and provides a more professional solution to the problem.
