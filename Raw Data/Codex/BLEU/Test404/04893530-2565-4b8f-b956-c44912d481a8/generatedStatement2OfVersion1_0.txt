**How to Run (with command-line arguments):**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StringEndsWith.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:  `javac StringEndsWith.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with two string arguments: `java StringEndsWith "This is a test" "test"`  (Replace the strings with your desired inputs.  The double quotes are important, especially if your strings contain spaces.)

**Explanation:**

* **`endsWith()` method:** The simplest and most direct way to check if a string ends with another string is to use the built-in `endsWith()` method.  It's case-sensitive.
* **Alternative approach (without `endsWith()`):** The code also demonstrates how you could implement this check manually using a loop and character comparisons. This can be useful for understanding how `endsWith()` might work internally.  This part of the code takes input from command-line arguments (using `args`).
* **Command-line arguments:** The `args` array in the `main` method stores the command-line arguments passed to the program when it's run. `args[0]` is the first argument, `args[1]` is the second, and so on.
* **Error handling:** The code includes a basic check to ensure that two arguments are provided.  It also handles the case where the first string is shorter than the second, in which case it can't possibly end with the second string.
