Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Clearer Interval Class:** The `Interval` class is well-defined with `start` and `end` fields and appropriate getter methods.

2. **Concise toString():**  The `toString()` method in `Interval` makes printing the results much cleaner.

3. **Comprehensive Comments:** The code is well-commented, explaining the logic at each step, making it easier to understand.

4. **Handles Edge Cases:** The `merge` method handles cases where the input `intervals` list is `null` or has 0 or 1 elements correctly.


5. **Correct Merging Logic:** The merging logic is now accurate, handling both partially and fully overlapping intervals.

6. **Adds Last Interval:** The code correctly adds the last processed `current` interval to the `merged` list after the loop finishes. This was a common mistake in earlier versions.


This improved version provides a much better educational example for merging intervals in Java. It's clear, concise, and correctly handles all the important aspects of the problem.
