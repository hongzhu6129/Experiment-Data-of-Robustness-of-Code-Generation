4. **Very Large Radius:**
   - Input: `radius = 100000`
   - Expected Output:  (Check for potential overflow issues, though doubles have a large range)
     - Perimeter and Area will be very large values.  Verify the calculations are still correct.

5. **Small Radius:**
   - Input: `radius = 0.001`
   - Expected Output: Check for correct handling of small decimal values.

6. **Integer Radius:**
   - Input: `radius = 10`
   - Expected Output: Verify that integer inputs are handled correctly.


**How to Test:**

1. **Manual Input:**  Run the program and enter the test case input values one by one. Compare the output with the expected values.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):** Use a testing framework like JUnit to automate the tests.  This is much more efficient, especially for regression testing.  Here's a simple JUnit example:
