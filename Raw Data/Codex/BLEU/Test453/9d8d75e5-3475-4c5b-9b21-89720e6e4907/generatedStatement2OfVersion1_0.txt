**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner and edge cases, to test the Java program:

1. **Normal Case:**
   - Input: radius = 7.5
   - Expected Output: 
     - Perimeter:  47.12388980384689
     - Area: 176.71458676442586


2. **Zero Radius:**
   - Input: radius = 0
   - Expected Output:
     - Perimeter: 0.0
     - Area: 0.0


3. **Negative Radius (Invalid Input):**
   - Input: radius = -5
   - Expected Behavior:  While the code will run and produce results,  a negative radius doesn't make sense geometrically.  Consider adding input validation in your program to handle such cases:
