Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Test Cases:**  The code now includes comprehensive JUnit 5 test cases.  These tests cover:
   - Positive radius values.
   - Zero radius (a boundary case).
   - Negative radius (an invalid input � now throws `IllegalArgumentException`).
   - A test case for very large numbers to check for potential overflow or precision issues.

2. **Exception Handling:**  The `calculateArea` and `calculatePerimeter` methods now throw `IllegalArgumentException` if a negative radius is provided.  This is important for robust code.  The tests verify this behavior.

3. **Delta for Double Comparisons:** When comparing floating-point numbers (doubles), you should never use exact equality.  Instead, use `assertEquals(expected, actual, delta)` where `delta` is a small tolerance value to account for potential rounding errors.

4. **Clearer Output:**  The `main` method now prints the radius, perimeter, and area with labels, making the output easier to understand.

5. **Test Organization:**  The test cases are organized logically using `@Test` annotations, making them easy to run and maintain.

6. **Large Number Test:** Includes a test case with a large radius value to check how the calculations behave with large numbers and uses an appropriately adjusted delta for comparison.


How to run the tests (assuming you have JUnit 5 set up):

1. **IDE:** Most IDEs (IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans) have built-in support for running JUnit tests.  Right-click on the test class or method and select "Run."

2. **Command Line:** If you're using Maven or Gradle, you can run the tests from the command line using `mvn test` or `gradle test`, respectively.



This improved version is more robust, testable, and handles edge cases appropriately, making it better quality code overall.
