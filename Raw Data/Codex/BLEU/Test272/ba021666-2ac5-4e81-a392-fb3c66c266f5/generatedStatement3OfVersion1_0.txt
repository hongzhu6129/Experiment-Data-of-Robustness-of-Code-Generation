In the improved `ArithmeticOperations` class, you would create separate methods like `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`, and `modulo()`.  This makes testing much cleaner and more organized. This also helps to avoid catching the `ArithmeticException` within the main method which makes testing harder.


By using a testing framework, you ensure that your code works as expected and that changes you make in the future don't introduce bugs.  Automated tests make the development process much more robust.
