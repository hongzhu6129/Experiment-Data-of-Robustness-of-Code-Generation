**Test Cases:**

**Normal Cases:**

1. **Input:** num1 = 10, num2 = 5
   **Expected Output:**
   Sum: 15.0
   Difference: 5.0
   Product: 50.0
   Quotient: 2.0
   Remainder: 0.0

2. **Input:** num1 = 7.5, num2 = 2.5
   **Expected Output:**
   Sum: 10.0
   Difference: 5.0
   Product: 18.75
   Quotient: 3.0
   Remainder: 0.0

3. **Input:** num1 = -8, num2 = 3
   **Expected Output:**
   Sum: -5.0
   Difference: -11.0
   Product: -24.0
   Quotient: -2.6666666666666665
   Remainder: -2.0


**Corner Cases:**

4. **Division by Zero:** num1 = 10, num2 = 0
   **Expected Output:**
    Division by zero is not allowed.
    Remainder can not be calculated as divisor is zero.

5. **Zero divided by Zero:** num1 = 0, num2 = 0
   **Expected Output:**
    Division by zero is not allowed.
    Remainder is undefined for division by zero.


6. **Large Numbers:** num1 = Double.MAX_VALUE, num2 = Double.MAX_VALUE
   **Expected Output:** (Results may vary slightly due to floating-point precision limitations)
   Sum: Infinity
   Difference: 0.0
   Product: Infinity
   Quotient: 1.0
   Remainder: NaN


7. **Small Numbers:** num1 = Double.MIN_VALUE, num2 = Double.MIN_VALUE
   **Expected Output:**  (Results may vary slightly due to floating-point precision limitations)
   Sum: 4.4501477170144023E-308
   Difference: 0.0
   Product: 0.0
   Quotient: 1.0
   Remainder: 0.0


8. **One number is zero:** num1 = 0, num2 = 5
   **Expected Output:**
   Sum: 5.0
   Difference: -5.0
   Product: 0.0
   Quotient: 0.0
   Remainder: 0.0



These test cases cover various scenarios, including normal operations, division by zero, and using very large and small numbers, to ensure the program functions correctly in different situations.  When testing, compare the actual output of your program with the expected output for each test case to verify its correctness.
