**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **`main` Method:**  The `main` method now initializes a sample 2D boolean array and calls the `printBooleanArray` method to handle the printing logic.

2. **`printBooleanArray` Method:** This helper method takes the 2D boolean array as input.  It uses nested enhanced `for` loops (also known as for-each loops) to iterate through the array:
   - The outer loop iterates through each row of the array.
   - The inner loop iterates through each boolean element within a row.

3. **Conditional Printing:** Inside the inner loop, the ternary operator (`condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`) is used to print "t" if the boolean element is `true` and "f" if it's `false`.  This makes the output more concise and readable.

4. **Newlines:** `System.out.println()` is used after each row is printed to ensure the output is formatted correctly as a 2D array.

**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `PrintBooleanArray.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using the Java compiler:
