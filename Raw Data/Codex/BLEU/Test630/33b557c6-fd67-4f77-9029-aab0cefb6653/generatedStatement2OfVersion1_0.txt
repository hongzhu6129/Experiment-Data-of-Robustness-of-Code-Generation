Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly deals with `null` strings, negative or zero `n` values, and `n` values greater than the string length.  It returns the original string in these cases, as per good practice.
- **Clearer method signature:**  The method now takes three arguments: the string, the number of characters to repeat, and the number of times to repeat them.  This is more flexible and intuitive.
- **Uses StringBuilder for efficiency:**  For repeated string concatenation, `StringBuilder` is significantly more efficient than using `+` or `String.concat()`.
- **More comprehensive testing in `main`:**  Includes examples with various inputs, including edge cases, to demonstrate the method's behavior.
- **Javadoc Documentation:**  Added Javadoc comments to clearly explain the method's purpose, parameters, and return value, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
