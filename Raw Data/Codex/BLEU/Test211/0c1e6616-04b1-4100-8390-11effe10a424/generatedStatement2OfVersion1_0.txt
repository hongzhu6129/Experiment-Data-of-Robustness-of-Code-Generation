Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly adheres to the requested method signatures: `public static void main(String[])` and `private static int[] Saddleback(int[][], int, int, int)`.

2. **Saddleback Search Implementation:** The `Saddleback` method correctly implements the saddleback search algorithm. It starts at the top-right corner of the matrix and efficiently eliminates either a row or a column in each step.

3. **Return Value:**  The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` where the first element is the row index and the second element is the column index. If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}` to indicate failure.

4. **Example Usage in main():** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` method with a sample 2D array and target value.  It also handles the case where the target isn't found.

5. **Added test case:** A second test case is added with a target value that isn't present in the matrix. This demonstrates that the code handles the "not found" condition correctly.


How Saddleback Search Works:

The algorithm starts at the top-right corner of the matrix.  In each step:

- If the current element is equal to the target, the search is successful.
- If the current element is smaller than the target, the entire row can be eliminated as all elements to the left are also smaller.  Move down to the next row.
- If the current element is larger than the target, the entire column can be eliminated as all elements below are also larger. Move left to the previous column.


This process continues until the target is found or the search goes out of bounds, indicating that the target is not present.
