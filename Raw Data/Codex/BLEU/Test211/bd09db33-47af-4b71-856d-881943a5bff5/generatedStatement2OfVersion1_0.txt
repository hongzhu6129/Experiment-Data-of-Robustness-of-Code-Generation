Key improvements and explanations in this refined version:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `m` and `n` for dimensions makes the code more readable than `rows` and `cols` (especially in the context of matrix algorithms).

2. **Concise Return:** Returning `new int[]{-1, -1}` directly is more efficient and easier to understand than creating a separate `result` array within the `Saddleback` method.

3. **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method now demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` method with sample data and handles the case where the target is not found.  It also includes a second example search.

4. **Comments:** Comments have been added to explain the logic and the purpose of the code sections.

5. **Error Handling:** The `main` method checks the returned array to see if the target was found and prints an appropriate message.


How the Saddleback search works:

The algorithm starts at the top-right corner of the matrix.  It then compares the current element with the target:

- **If they are equal:** The target is found, and the row and column indices are returned.
- **If the current element is less than the target:**  The target cannot be in the current row (because the row is sorted in ascending order), so we move down to the next row.
- **If the current element is greater than the target:** The target cannot be in the current column (because the column is sorted in ascending order), so we move left to the previous column.


This process continues until either the target is found or we go out of the bounds of the matrix (meaning the target is not present).
