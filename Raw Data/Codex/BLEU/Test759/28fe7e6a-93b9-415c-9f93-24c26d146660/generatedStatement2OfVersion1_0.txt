Key improvements and explanations:

1. **TreeNode Class:** Added a `TreeNode` class to represent the structure of the binary tree.  This makes the code more organized and easier to understand.

2. **Comprehensive Example Usage in `main()`:** Added several test cases in the `main` method to demonstrate how to use the `is_Identical_tree_node` function with different scenarios, including:
   - Two identical trees.
   - Two trees with a difference in value.
   - Cases with null trees (both null, one null, one not null).  This handles edge cases robustly.

3. **Clearer Explanation in `is_Identical_tree_node()`:**  Added comments to explain the logic of each step in the recursive function.

4. **Base Cases for Null Handling:** The code now explicitly handles the cases where one or both of the input `TreeNode`s are null.  This is essential for correctness.

5. **Recursive Check:** The core logic uses recursion to traverse and compare the left and right subtrees of both trees.  This is the most efficient way to solve this problem.
