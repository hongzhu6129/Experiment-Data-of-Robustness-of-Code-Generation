Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles Locale-Specific Weeks:** The code now demonstrates how to use `WeekFields` to correctly calculate the first and last day of the week according to different locale settings. This is important because the first day of the week (Sunday or Monday) and the week numbering itself can vary by region.

* **Clearer Looping:** The loop now iterates directly through the desired number of weeks, making the logic clearer.

* **ISO Standard and Locale Example:** The code provides examples using both the ISO standard (Monday start) and a specific locale (US, which has a Sunday start).  This highlights the importance of using `WeekFields` for correct results in different regions.

* **Incrementing with ISO:** The loop now increments by adding days to the last day calculated using the ISO standard week.  This avoids accidentally skipping weeks if the locale defines weeks differently.



This revised code is more robust and adaptable to different cultural contexts.  It also more clearly demonstrates how to calculate the first and last day of a week accurately.
