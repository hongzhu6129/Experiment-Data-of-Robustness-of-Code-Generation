 Only use the method signatures public static void main(String[]), private static void bucketSort(int[]), private static int hash(int, int, int), public static int max(int[]), public static int min(int[]) to generate code for the Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the Bucket Sort Algorithm.\nBucket sort is a sorting algorithm that distributes the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. It is a distribution sort, a generalization of pigeonhole sort, and a cousin of radix sort in the most-to-least significant digit flavor. \n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n Avoid using Solution as the class name.
