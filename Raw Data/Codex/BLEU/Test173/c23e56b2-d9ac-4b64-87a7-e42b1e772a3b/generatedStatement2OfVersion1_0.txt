Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles cases where 10 doesn't exist:** The code now explicitly checks if 10 is present in the original array.  If not, it prints an informative message.
* **Handles cases where 10 is the last element:** The code checks if there are any elements *after* the last occurrence of 10.  If 10 is the very last element, the new array will have a length of 0, and the code now handles this gracefully by printing a message, preventing potential `NegativeArraySizeException`.
* **Clearer output:**  The output now clearly labels the new array, making it easier to understand the results.
* **More descriptive variable names:**  Using names like `last10Index` instead of just `i` or `index` makes the code easier to read and understand.


Example Usage and Output:

**Scenario 1: 10 exists and has elements after it.**
