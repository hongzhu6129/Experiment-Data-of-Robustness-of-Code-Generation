**Explanation:**

1. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - This is the entry point of the program.
   - It takes the input string (e.g., "abc").
   - It calls `permutationWithRepeation()` to start the permutation process.

2. **`permutationWithRepeation(String str)`:**
   - This method initializes the recursive process by calling `showPermutation()` with an empty prefix.

3. **`showPermutation(String str, String prefix)`:**
   - This is the recursive function that generates the permutations.
   - **Base Case:**  If the `prefix` length equals the `str` length, it means a complete permutation is formed.  Print the `prefix` and return.
   - **Recursive Step:**
     - It iterates through each character of the input `str`.
     - For each character, it makes a recursive call to `showPermutation()`.
     - The new `prefix` in the recursive call is the current `prefix` plus the current character from `str`. This effectively builds up the permutations character by character.
