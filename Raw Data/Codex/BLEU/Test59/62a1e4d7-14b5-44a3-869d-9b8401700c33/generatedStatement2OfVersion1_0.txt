To compile and run this from the command line:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SumOfTwoNumbers.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type `javac SumOfTwoNumbers.java` and press Enter.  This creates `SumOfTwoNumbers.class`
3. **Run (with hardcoded values):** `java SumOfTwoNumbers`  This will print "74 + 36: 110".
4. **Run (with command-line input):** `java SumOfTwoNumbers 25 50`  This will print "25 + 50: 75". You can change 25 and 50 to any other numbers.



Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Output:** The output now shows the original numbers and their sum, making it easier to understand.
* **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters non-numeric input through command-line arguments.  This prevents the program from crashing.
* **Flexibility:** The program now works with hardcoded values *and* accepts command-line input, making it more versatile for teaching and learning.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the code's purpose and how to use the command-line arguments.
