   * `java SumOfSeven`:  This command executes your Java program.
   * `10 20 30 40 50 60 70`: These are the command-line arguments.  They are passed as strings into the `args` array in your `main` method.
   * The code inside the `if (args.length == 7)` block checks if you provided exactly seven arguments.
   * `Integer.parseInt(arg)` converts each string argument to an integer so you can perform the addition.
   * The `try-catch` block handles potential errors if the user enters non-numeric arguments.

**Key improvements in this version:**

* **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block prevents the program from crashing if the user provides invalid input.  It prints a helpful error message instead.
* **Flexibility:** Using command-line arguments makes the program much more reusable. You don't have to change the code every time you want to sum different numbers.
* **Clearer Instructions:** The `else` block provides instructions to the user if they don't provide enough arguments.


This revised response provides a much more robust and practical solution for summing seven numbers in Java using only the `main` method.
