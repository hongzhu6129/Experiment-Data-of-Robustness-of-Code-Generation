Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `uniqueIndex` instead of just `i` or `j` for the index tracking unique elements makes the code easier to understand.

2. **Comprehensive Comments:**  The Javadoc comment at the beginning of the `removeDuplicates` method explains its purpose, parameters, return value, and provides examples, making it an educational piece of code.  In-line comments also help to clarify the logic.

3. **Edge Case Handling:** The code explicitly handles cases where the input array is `null` or empty, ensuring robustness.

4. **Concise Logic:** The core logic for removing duplicates is kept efficient and straightforward using a single `for` loop and the `uniqueIndex` to track the position for placing the next unique element.

5. **Illustrative `main` Method:** The `main` method now demonstrates the function's behavior with multiple test cases, including edge cases (empty array, null array, single-element array), showcasing its usage and output.  The use of `Arrays.copyOfRange` in the `main` method ensures we only print the relevant part of the array (up to the new length).



This revised code provides a more educational and robust solution to the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array while adhering to the specified method signatures.
