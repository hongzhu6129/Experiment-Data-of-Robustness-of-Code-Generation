Key improvements and explanations:

* **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays, returning 0 in both cases, preventing potential `NullPointerExceptions`.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueIndex` is a more descriptive name than just `i` for the index tracking unique elements.
* **Concise Logic:** The code is now more streamlined, making it easier to understand the core logic.
* **Comprehensive Testing in `main`:**  The `main` method includes various test cases, including duplicates, no duplicates, an empty array, and a null array, to demonstrate the robustness of the `removeDuplicates` method.
* **Outputting Updated Array:** The `main` method now prints the updated array (the portion without duplicates) alongside the new length using `Arrays.copyOfRange`, which is helpful for visualization and debugging.


This improved version is more robust, readable, and effectively demonstrates the functionality of the `removeDuplicates` method through diverse test cases.
