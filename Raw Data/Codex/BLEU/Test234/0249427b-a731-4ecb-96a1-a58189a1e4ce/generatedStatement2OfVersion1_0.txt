Key improvements in this educational example:

* **Clearer Explanations:**  Comments explain the purpose of each code section.  It emphasizes the importance of the `boolean` argument in `headMap` for inclusive/exclusive behavior.
* **Multiple Demonstrations:** The code demonstrates getting the headMap with different upper bounds and both inclusive and exclusive options.
* **Handles Empty Results:** Shows how to check for and handle cases where the `headMap` returns an empty map.
* **Independent Copy:**  Explicitly points out the crucial detail that the `headMap` returns a *view*, not a copy, and provides code for creating an independent copy if needed.
* **Helper Function:** Uses a `printMap` helper function for cleaner output and better code organization.


This revised example is more comprehensive and provides a better learning experience for those unfamiliar with `NavigableMap` and its `headMap` method.
