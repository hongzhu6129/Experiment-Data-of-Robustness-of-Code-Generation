Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Clear Javadoc documentation:** The `removeDuplicates` method now has comprehensive Javadoc explaining its purpose, parameters, return value, and providing examples. This makes the code much easier to understand and use.

2. **Handles edge cases:** The code now explicitly handles edge cases like an empty array or a `null` array, making it more robust.

3. **Efficient in-place modification:** The code directly modifies the input array `nums` to remove duplicates in-place, saving memory and improving efficiency.  

4. **Clear variable names:** Using `uniqueIndex` instead of just `i` or `j` makes the logic clearer to follow.

5. **Comprehensive `main` method:** The `main` method provides multiple test cases, including edge cases (empty array, single element array), demonstrating how to use the `removeDuplicates` method and how to print the updated array. It also uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to only print the relevant portion of the modified array.


This revised version is a better educational example as it's more readable, robust, efficient, and clearly demonstrates the in-place modification of the array while handling edge cases.
