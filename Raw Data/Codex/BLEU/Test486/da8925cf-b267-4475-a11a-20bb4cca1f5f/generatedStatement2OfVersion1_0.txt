**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The code now uses `Math.abs(number)` to handle negative input correctly.  The sum of digits is calculated based on the absolute value.

2. **Clearer Output:** Added a newline character (`System.out.println()`) at the end of the `main` method to separate the output from the next command prompt line, making the output cleaner.

3. **Space Handling:**  The code avoids a trailing space after the last digit's word by including a condition `if (tempSum > 0)` before printing the space within the loop.

4. **Input Validation (in `print_number`):**  A basic input validation check is added to `print_number` to handle cases where `digit` might be outside the 0-9 range (though this is less likely given how the code is structured).

5. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain key parts of the logic.
