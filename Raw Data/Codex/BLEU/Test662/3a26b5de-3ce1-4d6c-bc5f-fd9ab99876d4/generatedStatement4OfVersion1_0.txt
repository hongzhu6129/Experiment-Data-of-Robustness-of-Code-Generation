Explanation:

1. **Create a TreeMap:**  `TreeMap<String, Integer> treeMap = new TreeMap<>();` creates a TreeMap that stores String keys and Integer values.
2. **Add elements:** `treeMap.put("key", value);` adds key-value pairs to the TreeMap.
3. **Clear the TreeMap:**  `treeMap.clear();` removes all elements (key-value pairs) from the TreeMap.  The TreeMap becomes empty after this operation.
4. **Print the TreeMap:** `System.out.println(treeMap);` displays the contents of the TreeMap.
5. **Adding back after clear():** Shows that the TreeMap is still usable after `clear()` and new elements can be added.
6. **Illustrative Example:** Reinforces that `clear()` removes *both* keys and values, not just values.



This educational example demonstrates how to create, populate, and clear a `TreeMap` in Java.  The output clearly shows the TreeMap before and after the `clear()` operation, highlighting that it effectively removes all entries. The additional code examples demonstrate the impact of `clear()` and how the TreeMap can still be used after clearing.
