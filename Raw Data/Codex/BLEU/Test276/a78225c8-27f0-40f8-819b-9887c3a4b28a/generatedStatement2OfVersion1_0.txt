**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input 1 | Input 2 | Input 3 | Expected Output | Notes                                   |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1        | 10      | 20      | 30      | 20.0           | Standard positive numbers              |
| 2        | -5      | 0       | 5       | 0.0            | Including negative and zero            |
| 3        | 0       | 0       | 0       | 0.0            | All zeros                             |
| 4        | 1.5     | 2.5     | 3.5     | 2.5            | Decimal numbers                        |
| 5        | 100000  | 200000  | 300000  | 200000.0      | Large numbers                         |
| 6        | -1000   | -2000   | -3000   | -2000.0       | Large negative numbers                |
| 7        | Double.MAX_VALUE | Double.MAX_VALUE/2 | 0  |  Infinity/NaN (implementation dependent)  |  Check for overflow possibility. Different Java versions may throw ArithmeticException or return Infinity or NaN|
| 8        | Double.MIN_VALUE | Double.MIN_VALUE | Double.MIN_VALUE | Double.MIN_VALUE     | Very small numbers                   |




**How to Run Test Cases (Example using JUnit):**

While you could manually enter these test cases, automated testing is much more efficient. Here's how you could write a JUnit test:
