**Explanation:**

1. **Node Class:** Represents a node in the binary tree. It contains the data and pointers to the left and right children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):**
   - **Base Case:** If the node is null (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**
     - Calculate the depth of the left subtree (`lDepth`) recursively.
     - Calculate the depth of the right subtree (`rDepth`) recursively.
     - Return the maximum of `lDepth` and `rDepth`, plus 1 (to account for the current node).

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - Creates a `BinaryTreeMaxDepth` object.
   - Creates a sample binary tree.
   - Calls `maxDepth()` with the root node to calculate the maximum depth/height.
   - Prints the result.



This implementation uses a simple recursive approach to efficiently determine the maximum depth of the binary tree.  It adheres to the requested method signatures.
