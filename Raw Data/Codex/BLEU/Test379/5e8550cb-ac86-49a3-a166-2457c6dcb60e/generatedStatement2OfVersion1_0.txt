Explanation:

1. **Node Class:** Represents a node in the ternary tree. It holds data and pointers to its left, mid, and right children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):**
   - **Base Case:** If the node is null (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  Recursively calculate the depth of the left, mid, and right subtrees. Then, return the maximum of these depths plus 1 (to account for the current node).

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - Creates instances of the `TernaryTreeMaxDepth` class and `Node` objects to build example ternary trees.
   - Calls the `maxDepth()` method to calculate and print the maximum depth of the trees. 
   - Includes multiple test cases (including an empty tree) for better verification.


How it addresses the prompt:

- It adheres strictly to the specified method signatures: `public int maxDepth(Node)` and `public static void main(String[])`.
- It accurately calculates the maximum depth (exceeds depth is interpreted as maximum depth) of a given ternary tree using recursion.  
- The `main` method provides example usage and test cases.
- The code is well-commented and easy to understand.
