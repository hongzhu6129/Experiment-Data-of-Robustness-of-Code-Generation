This code uses `System.getProperty()` to retrieve various Java environment properties. If Java is installed, these properties will have values.  If Java isn't installed, running this code (or any Java code) will likely result in an error before the code even executes. However, if there's a very unusual setup where Java is partially or incorrectly installed, checking the properties can give some clues.


The simplified check provides a more concise way to check if Java is installed. It only prints one line indicating the installation status and version. This might be more user-friendly if you're distributing this as a small utility to end-users.
