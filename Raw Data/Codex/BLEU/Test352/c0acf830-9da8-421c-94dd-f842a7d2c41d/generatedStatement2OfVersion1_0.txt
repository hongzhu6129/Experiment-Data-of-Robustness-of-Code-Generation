**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly adheres to the provided method signatures: `main(String[])` and `removeSetofCharacters(String, String, String)`.

2. **Character Removal:** The `charsToRemove` string is iterated through, and each character is removed from the `inputString` using the `replace()` method. This handles cases where the characters to remove might appear multiple times.

3. **String Removal:** The `stringToRemove` is removed from the `inputString` using the `replace()` method.

4. **Clear Output:** The `System.out.println()` statement clearly displays the modified string after the removals.

5. **Multiple Test Cases (in main):** I added a couple of test cases in the `main` method to demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs. This is good practice for testing your code.

**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `RemoveCharacters.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac RemoveCharacters.java`
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program using: `java RemoveCharacters`



The output for the given examples will be:
