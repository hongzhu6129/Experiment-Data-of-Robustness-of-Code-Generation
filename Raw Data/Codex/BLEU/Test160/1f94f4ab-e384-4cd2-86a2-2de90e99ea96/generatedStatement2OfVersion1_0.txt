Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Clarity and Examples:**  Added comments and examples to demonstrate how to get the offset from different time zones (Kolkata and Los Angeles) and also with a fixed offset value. This makes the code easier to understand and adapt.
* **Correct Sign Handling:** The `formatOffset` method now correctly handles both positive and negative offsets using the ternary operator (`? :`) for cleaner logic.
* **Leading Zeros:** The format string `%s%02d:%02d` ensures that hours and minutes are always displayed with two digits (e.g., +05:30 or -08:00), which is the standard format for time zone offsets.
* **Absolute Value for Minutes:**  The `Math.abs()` function is used when calculating the minutes.  This avoids negative minute values, which would be incorrect in an offset representation (it should always be, for instance, +05:30, not +05:-30).
* **ISO_OFFSET_DATE_TIME Format:** Using `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_OFFSET_DATE_TIME` provides a standardized, clear output format for the date and time including the offset.


This improved version is more robust, handles different offset scenarios correctly, and provides clear, well-formatted output.
