Key improvements in this code:

* **Clearer Comments:**  Explains what "exceeds" means in this context and why the calculations are done the way they are.  Especially important for the month, which is 0-indexed.
* **Human-Readable Month:** Adds 1 to the month value when printing it so that the output shows months from 1 to 12.
* **Uses `GregorianCalendar` Explicitly (Optional but Good Practice):**  While the default calendar is usually `GregorianCalendar`, it's better to be explicit.
* **Correct Calculation of "Exceeds":** The logic for calculating the "exceeds" value is now aligned with the provided interpretation.


This revised version addresses the previous issues and makes the code more understandable and robust.
