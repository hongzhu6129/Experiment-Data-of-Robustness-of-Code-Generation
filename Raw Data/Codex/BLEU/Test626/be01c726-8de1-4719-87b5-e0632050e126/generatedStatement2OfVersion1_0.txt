**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Binary Literals:** Use `0b` prefix (e.g., `0b10`, `0b11`) to represent binary numbers directly.  This makes the code clearer.
2. **Helper Functions:**  The code is more structured and readable by using helper functions `binaryToDecimal` and `decimalToBinary` to handle the conversions.
3. **Decimal Multiplication:** The core logic converts binary numbers to decimal, multiplies them, and then converts the decimal product back to binary. This is a straightforward approach.
4. **`decimalToBinary` Improvement:** The `decimalToBinary` function was optimized to use integer math and avoid String concatenation which can be less efficient.
5. **Clearer Output:**  The output now clearly states "product of two binary numbers:" which enhances readability.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.java` file (e.g., `MultiplyBinary.java`).
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it:
