5. **Corner case: Integer.MAX_VALUE:**
   - Input: 2147483647  (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
   - Expected Output:  This will show correct multiplication for the first few lines, but eventually, integer overflow will occur, and the results will become incorrect. (This demonstrates the limitations of using `int`).  You would need to use `long` to handle larger numbers properly.  


6. **Invalid Input (Non-integer):** 
    - Input:  "abc" or "2.5" (You could test this in a separate test suite that checks for exceptions)
    - Expected behavior: The `Scanner.nextInt()` method will throw an `InputMismatchException` if the input is not a valid integer. The program should handle this gracefully (e.g., with a `try-catch` block) to avoid crashing and to provide informative error messages to the user.
