This code utilizes the `searchMatrix` method with the specified signature and includes a `main` method for demonstration purposes.  It efficiently searches the matrix by starting at the top-right corner and eliminating either a row or a column in each step, making it an O(m+n) solution where 'm' is the number of rows and 'n' is the number of columns.  The `main` method provides test cases to verify the functionality.  Important edge cases like empty matrices are also handled.
