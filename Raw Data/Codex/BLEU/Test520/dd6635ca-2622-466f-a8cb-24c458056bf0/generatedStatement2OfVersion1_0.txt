Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is formatted for better readability with consistent indentation and spacing.  Comments explain the logic.
2. **Optimizations:** Several `break` statements are added within the loops. This significantly improves performance by preventing unnecessary calculations when the sum or cube exceeds the target `n`.
3. **Distinct Pairs:** The inner loops for `b` and `d` start from `a + 1` and `c + 1` respectively. This ensures that we generate only distinct pairs (a, b) and (c, d), avoiding duplicates and self-pairs (like 1^3 + 1^3).
4. **Explicit Check for Different Pairs:**  The condition `if (a != c && a != d && b != c && b != d)` is added to explicitly verify that the pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are different.  This prevents cases where the same pair is found in a different order (e.g.,  (1, 12) and (12, 1)).
5. **Return after Finding a Solution:**  The `return` statement is added after the first Ramanujan number is found. This is the most common requirement of the problem (find *any* such number). If you want to find *all* such numbers within the range, remove the `return` statement.
6. **Parameterizable `n`:** The upper limit `n` is now a variable at the beginning of the `main` method, making it easy to test different ranges.



How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type: `javac Ramanujan.java`
3. **Run:**  Type: `java Ramanujan`


The output will be:
