Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Efficiency:**  The code includes crucial optimizations to reduce unnecessary calculations. It breaks out of inner loops when the sum of cubes exceeds `n` or the target sum.
2. **Duplicate Avoidance:** The loops are structured ( `b` starts from `a`, and `d` starts from `c`) to avoid checking duplicate pairs (e.g., 1� + 12� and 12� + 1� are the same).
3. **Clarity:** The code is well-commented, making it easier to understand the logic.
4. **Correctness:** The nested loops systematically check all possible combinations within the given range, ensuring that the first number that meets the criteria is found.
5. **Direct `return`:** After finding a solution, the program uses `return` to exit the `main` method immediately, avoiding unnecessary further computations.


This revised code provides a more efficient and correct solution to the problem of finding Ramanujan-like numbers.
