Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Clearer Prompts and Error Handling:**  The code provides specific prompts for date input and includes error handling using a `try-catch` block to manage potential `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters an invalid date format.  It loops until a valid date is entered.
* **`Period` for Accurate Calculation:** It uses `Period.between()` for accurate calculation of years and months, addressing potential inaccuracies in manual calculations involving days and months.
* **Explicit Date Format:**  It explicitly defines the date format (`yyyy-MM-dd`) and uses `DateTimeFormatter` to ensure consistent parsing.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed at the end using `scanner.close()` to release the resource.
