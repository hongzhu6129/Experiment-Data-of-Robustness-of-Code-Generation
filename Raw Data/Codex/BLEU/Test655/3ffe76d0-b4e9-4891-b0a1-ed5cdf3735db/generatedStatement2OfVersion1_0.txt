Key improvements:

1. **Clarity and Readability:**  Improved comments and variable names make the code easier to understand.
2. **Correctness:** The `exponentialSearch` method now correctly handles the edge cases, including when the target element is at the beginning of the array or not present at all. 
3. **Efficiency:** The use of  `Math.min(i, n - 1)` in the binary search range prevents potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
4. **Adherence to Prompt:** The code strictly adheres to the provided method signatures: `public static void main(String[])` and `private static int exponentialSearch(int[], int)`.  The binary search is implemented as a helper function (`binarySearch`) within `exponentialSearch`.
5. **Testability:** The `main` method demonstrates the usage of the `exponentialSearch` method with both a present and a non-present target element, making it easy to test and verify the functionality.
