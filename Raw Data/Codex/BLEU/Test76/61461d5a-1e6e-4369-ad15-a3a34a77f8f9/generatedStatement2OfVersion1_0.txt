Explanation and Educational Points:

1. **Regular Expressions:** The core of the solution is using regular expressions.  The `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from `java.util.regex` provide powerful tools for working with patterns in strings.  
   - `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` : This regular expression defines a character class that matches any character *except* lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), and digits (0-9).  The `^` inside the square brackets negates the character class.
   - `matcher.replaceAll("")`: This method replaces all occurrences of the matched pattern (non-alphanumeric characters) with an empty string, effectively removing them.

2. **`validate()` Method:**  This method encapsulates the cleaning logic.  It's good practice to separate such functionality into a method for reusability and clarity.

3. **Null Handling:**  The `validate()` method includes a check for `null` input.  This is important to prevent `NullPointerExceptions` and makes the code more robust.

4. **`main()` Method for Demonstration:** The `main()` method provides examples of how to use the `validate()` method. Including different example inputs, like a string with only alphanumeric characters, helps illustrate the function's behavior.

5. **Alternative Approaches (Mentioned for Educational Purposes):** While regular expressions are concise and efficient, you could also achieve the same result using a loop and checking each character individually:
