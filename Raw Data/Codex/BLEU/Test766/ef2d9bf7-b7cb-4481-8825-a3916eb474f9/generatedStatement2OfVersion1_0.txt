Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles negative inputs correctly:** Uses `Math.abs()` and a `sign` variable to manage negative numbers appropriately.
* **Clearer output:** Adds commas and a newline to separate the printed factors and make the output more readable.
* **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles cases where the input `n` is smaller than 3 (in absolute value).  It now prints nothing if there are no multiples of 3 within the range, or just the closest multiple of 3 if the absolute value is less than 3.
* **More comprehensive testing:** The `main` method includes more test cases to demonstrate the correct behavior in various situations.


This improved version directly addresses the prompt's requirements and provides a more robust and clear solution.
