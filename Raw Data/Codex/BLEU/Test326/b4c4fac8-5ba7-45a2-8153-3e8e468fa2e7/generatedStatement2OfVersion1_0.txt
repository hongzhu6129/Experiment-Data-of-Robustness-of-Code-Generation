**Explanation of the core logic:**

The formula `(numerator + denominator - 1) / denominator` effectively rounds up the result of integer division.  Here's why:

1. **Adding `denominator - 1`:** This ensures that even if the division is perfectly even, the result gets bumped up to the next integer if the numerator isn't a multiple of the denominator.  

2. **Integer Division `/`:** Integer division truncates any fractional part.


**Example Breakdown:**

Let's take `17 / 5`:

* Standard integer division: `17 / 5 = 3` (the remainder is discarded)

* Rounded up: `(17 + 5 - 1) / 5 = 21 / 5 = 4`

**Handling Negative Numerators:**

For negative numerators, be aware that this method rounds *towards zero*.  If you need to round "up" in the sense of away from zero (e.g., -5 / 2 should round to -3), you'll need to use a slightly different approach with `Math.ceil()`.  See the alternative solution below if this is your requirement.



**Alternative Solution using `Math.ceil()` (for rounding away from zero with negatives):**

If you need the rounding to behave differently with negative numbers (rounding away from zero), you'll need to use floating-point math and `Math.ceil()`:
