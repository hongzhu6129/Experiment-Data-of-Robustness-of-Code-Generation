This improved version includes:

1. **Input Validation:** It checks if `start` and `end` are within the valid range of the string indices to prevent `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  It also handles the case when `start` is greater than `end`.

2. **Error Handling (try-catch):** It demonstrates how to handle `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` gracefully using a try-catch block. This is crucial to prevent program crashes and provide informative error messages if the substring extraction fails.

3. **Multiple Examples:** It shows several examples with different input strings and positions, including cases that demonstrate the error handling.

4. **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted to clearly distinguish the original string and the extracted substring, as well as to provide helpful error messages.



This makes the code more robust, easier to understand, and demonstrates best practices for substring extraction in Java.
