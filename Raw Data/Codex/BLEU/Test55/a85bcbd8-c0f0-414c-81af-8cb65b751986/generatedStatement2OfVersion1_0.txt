Explanation of the methods within `main`:

1. **`Integer.toOctalString(decimal)`:** This is the simplest and most efficient way to convert a decimal number to its octal representation in Java. It directly returns the octal value as a String.

2. **Manual Conversion:**  The second method demonstrates the conversion logic mathematically using a `while` loop.  While this works, it's less efficient and more verbose than using the built-in `toOctalString()` method.

3. **User Input Example:** This section shows how you could accept a decimal number as a command-line argument.  The `try-catch` block is essential here to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters non-numeric input.  In a more complete application, you would likely want more robust input validation.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DecimalToOctal.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac DecimalToOctal.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java DecimalToOctal`  (To provide input, use: `java DecimalToOctal 255` for example).
