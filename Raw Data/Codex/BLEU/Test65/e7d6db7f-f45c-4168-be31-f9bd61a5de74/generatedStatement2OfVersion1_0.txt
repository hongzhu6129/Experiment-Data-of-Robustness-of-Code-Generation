**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -74
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0  (Longitude doesn't matter at poles)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (Earth's circumference / 2)

4. **Antipodes (opposite sides of Earth):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 106 (180 degrees opposite longitude)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (Earth's circumference / 2)


5. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 90
   - Expected Distance: ~10007.54 km (Earth's circumference / 4)

6. **Points near the International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 60
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 60
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Distance: ~133.43 km (short distance across the date line)

7. **Invalid Input (Boundary conditions):**
    - lat1: 91 (out of range) � Test how your program handles this (e.g. throwing an exception, or clamping the value to 90)
    - lon1: -181 (out of range) 
    - lat2: -91 (out of range)
    - lon2: 361 (out of range)



**How to Implement Test Cases:**

You could create a separate test class (using JUnit or TestNG) that calls your `EarthDistance` class's calculation method with these input values and asserts that the returned distance is close to the expected value (using a tolerance for floating-point comparisons).


Example using JUnit (adjust with your preferred testing framework):
