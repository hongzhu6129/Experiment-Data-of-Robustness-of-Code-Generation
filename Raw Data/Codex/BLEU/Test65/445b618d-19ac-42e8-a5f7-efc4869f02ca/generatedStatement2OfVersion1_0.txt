**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Original Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -74
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

3. **Antipodal Points (Opposite sides of the Earth):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 106 
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.09 km (approximately Earth's diameter)

4. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0  (Longitude is irrelevant at the poles)
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0 (Longitude is irrelevant at the poles)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.09 km

5. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 90
   - Expected Distance: ~10007.54 km (approximately 1/4 Earth's circumference)


6. **Points near the International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 10
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 10
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Distance: ~222.64 km  (should be a small distance)

7. **Invalid Input (e.g., latitude > 90):** The program should ideally handle invalid inputs gracefully, either by throwing an exception or printing an error message. You could enhance the code with input validation:
