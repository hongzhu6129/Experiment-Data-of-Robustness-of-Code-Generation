**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner and edge cases, to thoroughly test the Java program:

1. **Original Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -74
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

3. **Antipodal Points (Opposite sides of the Earth - maximum distance):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: -40  
   - lon2: 106 (180 degrees opposite longitude)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.09 km (approximately Earth's diameter)



4. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90 (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0   (Longitude doesn't matter at poles)
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.09 km

5. **Equatorial Points:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 180 
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.09 km

6. **Points near the Prime Meridian and International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 10
   - lon1: 0.1  (Near Prime Meridian)
   - lat2: 10
   - lon2: -179.9 (Near International Date Line)
   - Expected Distance: ~ A small distance (because these are very close geographically)


7. **Invalid Input:**
   - lat1: 91 (outside valid latitude range)
   - lon1: 181 (outside valid longitude range)
   - lat2:  (etc.) � Consider how your program should handle such input.


**How to Use the Test Cases:**

1. **Manual Testing:**  Enter the input values into your program and compare the output with the expected distance.

2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  Create a set of unit tests (e.g., using JUnit) to automatically run these tests. This is much more efficient and helps ensure your code remains correct as you make changes.  Example of JUnit test (you'll need to add JUnit to your project):
