**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner/edge cases:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Output: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40.7128
   - lon1: -74.0060 (New York City)
   - lat2: 40.7128
   - lon2: -74.0060
   - Expected Output: 0 km

3. **Antipodes (Opposite sides of the Earth):**
   - lat1: 40.7128
   - lon1: -74.0060 
   - lat2: -40.7128
   - lon2: 105.9940 (approximately)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's diameter)



4. **North Pole to Equator:**
   - lat1: 90
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 0  (Longitude doesn't matter at the poles)
   - Expected Output: ~10007.54 km (approximately � Earth's circumference)

5. **Equator to itself (different longitudes):**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 180
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's diameter, as points are antipodal on the equator)

6. **Near Antipodes (with slight offset):**
   - lat1: 45
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: -44.9
   - lon2: 180
   - Expected Output: ~19996.11 km (very close to the diameter)

7. **Dateline Crossing:**
   - lat1: 10
   - lon1: 175
   - lat2: 10
   - lon2: -175 
   - Expected Output:  ~1246.44 km (relatively short distance because these longitudes are close)

8. **Invalid Input (outside latitude/longitude range):**
   - lat1: 100  (latitude should be between -90 and 90)
   - lon1: 200 (longitude should be between -180 and 180)
   - lat2: 20
   - lon2: 30
   - Expected Behavior: Your program should ideally handle this gracefully, perhaps by throwing an exception or printing an error message.   NaN (Not a Number) might also be produced by the `Math.acos()` function if the input to it is outside the range -1 to 1.


These test cases cover various scenarios and potential edge cases to ensure your program calculates distances correctly under different conditions.  You can use a testing framework like JUnit to automate these tests.  Remember to handle invalid latitude/longitude inputs appropriately.
