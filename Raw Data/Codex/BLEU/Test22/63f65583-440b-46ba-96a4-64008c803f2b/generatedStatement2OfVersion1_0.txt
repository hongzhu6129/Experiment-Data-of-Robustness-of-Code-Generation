**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Hardcoded Example:** The code initially demonstrates the sum of 74 and 36 as requested, printing the result in the specified format.

2. **Command-Line Arguments:**  The enhanced version allows you to provide two numbers as command-line arguments when you run the program.  This makes it more flexible for testing with different inputs.

3. **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters non-integer arguments, providing a helpful error message.

**How to run with command-line arguments:**

1. **Compile:** `javac SumOfTwoNumbers.java`
2. **Run:** `java SumOfTwoNumbers 12 34`  (Replace 12 and 34 with your desired numbers).


This revised answer addresses the original problem and demonstrates how to make the program more versatile and robust.
