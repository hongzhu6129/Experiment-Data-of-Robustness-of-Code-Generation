**Test Cases:**

| Input (n) | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 |  |
| 1 | 123 |  |
| 2 | 246 |  |
| 5 | 615 | |
| 9 | 1107 | |
| -1 | "Please enter a single-digit integer (0-9)." | Negative input (corner case) |
| 10 | "Please enter a single-digit integer (0-9)." |  Input greater than 9 (corner case) |
| a | "Invalid input. Please enter an integer." |  Non-integer input (corner case) |
| 1.5 | "Invalid input. Please enter an integer." | Floating point input |
| 9999999999 | "Please enter a single-digit integer (0-9)." | Very large number (to demonstrate that it's restricted to 0-9) |





**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Input Validation:** The code now includes input validation to handle potential errors.  It checks if the input is within the range of 0-9 and also handles `InputMismatchException` if the user enters non-integer input. This makes the code more robust.
2. **Clearer Error Messages:**  The error messages are more informative, guiding the user on what kind of input is expected.
3. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed in a `finally` block. This ensures that the resource is released even if an exception occurs.
4. **Single-Digit Restriction:**  The code explicitly restricts input to single digits (0-9). This avoids potential integer overflows if the user enters a very large number and simplifies the logic (you don't need to calculate the number of digits in `n` to construct `nn` and `nnn`).  If you need to handle larger numbers, you'd have to use `String` manipulation or a different approach.


This improved version addresses the potential issues in the original code and provides a more robust and user-friendly solution.
