**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`isCube()` method:**  This helper method efficiently determines if a number is a perfect cube:
   - It handles negative numbers correctly. The cube of a negative number is negative, so we recursively check the absolute value.
   - It calculates the cube root using `Math.cbrt()`.
   - It checks if the rounded cube root, when cubed, equals the original number.  This handles potential floating-point precision issues.


2. **`main()` method:**
   -  I've added multiple test cases in `main()` to demonstrate how the `isCube()` function works with different inputs (positive, negative, and non-cube numbers).
   - **User Input (Important Enhancement):**  In a real application, you should replace the hardcoded `number` with code to take user input:
