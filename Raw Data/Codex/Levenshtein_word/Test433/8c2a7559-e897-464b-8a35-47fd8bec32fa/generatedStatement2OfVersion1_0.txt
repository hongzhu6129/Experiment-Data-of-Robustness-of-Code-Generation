Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The code now correctly handles negative numbers.  A negative number is a perfect cube if its absolute value is a perfect cube.

2. **Handles Zero:** Explicitly checks if the number is 0, as 0 is a perfect cube.

3. **Efficient Cube Root Calculation:** Uses `Math.cbrt()` to compute the cube root efficiently. `Math.round()` is used to round the result to the nearest integer. This approach avoids iterating through possible cube roots, which is less efficient, especially for large numbers.

4. **Clearer Output:** The output messages are more descriptive, indicating whether the number is or isn't a cube.

5. **Helper Function:** The `isCube()` method encapsulates the cube-checking logic, making the `main` method cleaner and easier to understand.

6. **Integer Arithmetic:** The code uses integer arithmetic for the cube root check to avoid potential floating-point precision issues.
