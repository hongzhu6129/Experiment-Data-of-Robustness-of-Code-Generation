To run the JUnit tests, you'll need to add JUnit to your project (if you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, it can usually do this automatically) and then run the tests through the IDE or through the command line using a build tool like Maven or Gradle.



Automated testing with a framework like JUnit is a much more efficient and robust way to test your code, especially as the code gets more complex.  It ensures that you don't accidentally break your code when making changes later on.
