Note that the `swap` method is not actually *needed* for the most efficient implementation of this problem,  so I've provided a solution that uses the given signatures but optimizes the zero-moving logic within `move_zero` itself.   If you *had* to use `swap`, you'd end up with a less efficient (but still functional) solution involving more swaps.  The provided solution is generally the preferred approach.
