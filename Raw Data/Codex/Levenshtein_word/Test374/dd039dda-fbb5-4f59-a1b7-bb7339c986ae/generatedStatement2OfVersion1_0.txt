**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The `binomial_Coefficient` method now handles invalid input (k < 0 or k > n) by returning 0. The `main` method also checks for negative inputs.

2. **Optimization:** The code includes the optimization `if (k > n / 2) { k = n - k; }`. This utilizes the property C(n, k) = C(n, n-k) to reduce the number of iterations in the loop, improving efficiency, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.

3. **Efficient Calculation:** The calculation within the loop `result = result * (n - i + 1) / i;` is designed to avoid potential integer overflow by performing the multiplication before the division.  It ensures that the intermediate results stay within the `long` data type's range as much as possible.

4. **Clearer User Input:** The `main` method uses `Scanner` to get input from the user and provides clear prompts.

5. **Input Validation in main:** The main method now validates the input to ensure n and k are not negative.

6. **Resource Management:** The `scanner.close()` statement is added to release the `Scanner` resource after it's used.



This improved version provides more robust and efficient calculation of binomial coefficients. It also demonstrates better coding practices with input validation and resource management.
