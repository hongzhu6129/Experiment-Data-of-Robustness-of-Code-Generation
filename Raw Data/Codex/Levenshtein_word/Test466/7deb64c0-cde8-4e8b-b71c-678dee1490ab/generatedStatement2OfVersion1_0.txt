Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Tree Definition:**  The `TreeNode` class is now defined as a static inner class within the `TreeTraversal` class, making the code more organized and self-contained.

2. **Comprehensive Traversal Methods:** The code now includes level-order (BFS), pre-order, in-order, and post-order (DFS) traversal methods, demonstrating different ways to iterate through a tree.

3. **Improved Formatting:**  The code is formatted for better readability, with consistent indentation and spacing.

4. **Comments:**  Added comments explaining each traversal method and the purpose of the `TreeNode` class.

5. **Example Usage:** The `main` method creates a sample tree and demonstrates how to call each traversal method.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `TreeTraversal.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac TreeTraversal.java`
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program: `java TreeTraversal`
