**Explanation and "Proof" (within code comments and examples):**

1. **Euclid's Algorithm (euclid method):** The code implements the standard Euclidean algorithm using a `while` loop and the modulo operator (`%`).  It iteratively calculates the remainder until `b` becomes 0. The final value of `a` is the GCD.

2. **main method (Demonstrative Examples):** The `main` method provides several examples to illustrate the algorithm's correctness. It calculates the GCD for different pairs of numbers, including a case with coprime numbers (GCD = 1).

3. **Formal Proof (Commented Out):** The code includes a comment explaining the core idea behind the formal mathematical proof of Euclid's algorithm.  A full mathematical proof would involve concepts of divisibility and the division algorithm, which is beyond the scope of the required method signatures. However, by showing examples and highlighting the invariant `gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)`, the code provides a strong indication of the algorithm's validity.

**How to compile and run:**

1. Save the code as `EuclidGCD.java`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Compile the code: `javac EuclidGCD.java`
5. Run the code: `java EuclidGCD`


The output will show the GCD calculated using Euclid's algorithm for the test cases.  By comparing the output with the expected GCDs, you can see that the algorithm works correctly, providing empirical evidence (within the confines of the problem's restrictions) of its correctness.
