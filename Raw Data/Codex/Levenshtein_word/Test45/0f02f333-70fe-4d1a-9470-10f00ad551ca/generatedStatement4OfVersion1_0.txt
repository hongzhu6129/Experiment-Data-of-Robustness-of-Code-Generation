**Important Note:** The original array is modified in-place.  The function returns the length of the new array, which is the number of elements *not equal* to `val`. The elements beyond this new length in the original array are not guaranteed to have any specific values after the function call.  That's why we use `Arrays.copyOfRange` in the `main` method to create a clean new array with just the desired elements.
