This version uses `BigInteger` and bit-shifting (which is more efficient than the double-based `Math.pow()` for integer powers of 2) to correctly calculate and display even the very large Fermat numbers.  `intValueExact()` is used to ensure we don't lose information when converting the exponent to an `int` (though this will still limit us to exponents that can fit in an `int`).  If you need even larger exponents you might need a different approach.
