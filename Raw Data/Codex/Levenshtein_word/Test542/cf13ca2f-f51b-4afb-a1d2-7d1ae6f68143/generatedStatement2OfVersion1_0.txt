Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Binary Search in `temp()`:** The most significant change is using binary search in the `temp()` method.  This makes the search for the count much more efficient, especially for larger arrays. Sorting `arr2` once in `count_smaller_number()` is a crucial step to enable binary search.

2. **Clarity and Naming:**  The code is now more readable with clearer variable names (`arr1`, `arr2`, `target`).

3. **Corrected Logic:** The logic in `temp()` is adjusted to correctly handle the case where the target is smaller than all elements in `arr`, ensuring that the count is accurate in all scenarios.

4. **Example Usage in `main()`:** Added varied example usages in the `main()` method to demonstrate the functionality.

5. **Comments:** Included comments to explain the purpose of each section and method.
