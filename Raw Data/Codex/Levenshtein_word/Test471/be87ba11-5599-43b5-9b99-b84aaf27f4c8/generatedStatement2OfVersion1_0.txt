This code efficiently handles the edge cases where remainders are zero (representing 'Z') and adjusts `n` accordingly to avoid off-by-one errors. The `StringBuilder` is used for efficient string manipulation within the loop.  The `insert(0, ...)` method is used to build the string from right to left, as the calculation proceeds from rightmost column to leftmost.
