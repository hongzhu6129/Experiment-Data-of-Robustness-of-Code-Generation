This `safeSwap` method avoids overflow issues and is the recommended approach in most real-world scenarios.  The original method with addition/subtraction is presented for educational purposes (to show potential pitfalls) and because it's often asked in interview contexts. However, for reliable code, always use the `safeSwap` method or the bitwise XOR method, which also avoids overflow.
