Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Test Cases:**  The test cases are organized and labeled for better readability and understanding of what's being tested.
* **Corner Cases:** Includes corner cases like zero values, both zeros, and large numbers (close to the limits of `int`) to check for potential issues.
* **Temporary Variable Method (Recommended):**  The primary swapping method uses a `temp` variable. This is the most straightforward, readable, and safe way to swap variables and should be the preferred method in almost all situations.
* **Arithmetic and Bitwise Methods (Discouraged with Explanation):** While the arithmetic and bitwise XOR methods are included for completeness, they are clearly marked as *not recommended* due to the potential for overflow issues (arithmetic) and reduced code clarity (bitwise). It's important to understand these alternatives, but the temporary variable method is almost always the better choice in practice.



This revised answer provides a much more comprehensive and robust demonstration of swapping variables in Java, including clear testing and explanation of best practices.
