Explanation and Educational Comments:

1. **TreeNode Class:** Represents a node in the BST. Each node stores an integer value (`val`) and references to its left and right children.

2. **`sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums)`:**
   - This is the main public method that takes a sorted integer array as input.
   - It handles the base case of an empty or null array.
   - It calls the `creation` helper method to recursively build the BST.

3. **`creation(int[] nums, int start, int end)`:**
   - This recursive helper method does the actual BST construction.
   - **Midpoint as Root:**  The middle element of the current subarray (`nums[mid]`) is chosen as the root of the subtree. This ensures a balanced tree.  `mid` is calculated carefully to prevent overflow issues with large arrays.
   - **Recursive Calls:**  The `creation` method is called recursively for the left subarray (from `start` to `mid - 1`) and the right subarray (from `mid + 1` to `end`).
   - **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `start > end`, meaning the subarray is empty.

4. **`traverseTree(TreeNode root)`:**
   - This method demonstrates an inorder traversal of the created BST.  An inorder traversal of a BST visits the nodes in ascending order (which is how the original sorted array was organized). This verifies the correct construction of the BST.

5. **`main` method examples:** Demonstrates the usage of `sortedArrayToBST` with various input arrays (including an empty array) and prints the inorder traversal of the resulting BSTs.


**Key Concepts for Minimal Height:**

* **Choosing the Middle Element:** The key to maintaining minimal height (a balanced BST) is selecting the middle element of each subarray as the root. This ensures that the left and right subtrees have roughly the same number of nodes.
* **Recursion:** Recursion elegantly handles the division of the array into subarrays and the building of the BST in a top-down manner.



This improved response provides more detailed explanations and comments to make it a good educational resource for understanding the conversion of a sorted array to a BST.  The `main` method also provides examples and handles the edge case of an empty array. The `mid` calculation is now safer against potential integer overflows.
