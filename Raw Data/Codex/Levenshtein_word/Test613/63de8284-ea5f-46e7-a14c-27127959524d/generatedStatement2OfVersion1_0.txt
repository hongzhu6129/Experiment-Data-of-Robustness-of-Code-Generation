**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The provided evaluation scheme `((((0)x+6)x+(-4))x+7)x+(-19)` is a direct application of Horner's method (also called Horner's rule or Horner's scheme). Horner's method is an efficient way to evaluate polynomials. It minimizes the number of multiplications required.

2. **Java Implementation:** The `polyEval` method implements Horner's method using a simple loop. It starts with the highest power coefficient and iteratively multiplies and adds the next coefficient until it reaches the constant term.

3. **Clarity and Readability:** The code is well-commented to explain the logic and the example usage in `main`.  Variable names are descriptive (e.g., `coefficients`, `x`, `result`).

4. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `polyEval` function with a sample polynomial and x value. The output is included as a comment for easy verification.

5. **Generality:** The code can handle polynomials of any degree. Just provide the coefficients in the `List<Double> coefficients`  in ascending order of the corresponding power of x (constant term first, then the coefficient of x, then x^2, and so on).

6. **Error Handling (Optional):**  You could add error handling to `polyEval` to check for an empty `coefficients` list and throw an exception if it is.  This makes the function more robust.  For example:
