Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Comments:** Added more comments to explain what each part of the code does, especially the `Calendar` constants.

2. **`GregorianCalendar` mentioned:** Explicitly mentioned that `GregorianCalendar` is the default calendar implementation.

3. **`DAY_OF_MONTH` clarification:** Explained that `DAY_OF_MONTH` is what you'd typically use for "Day of Month" (not `DATE`).

4. **Day of Week Explanation:** Added an explanation that `DAY_OF_WEEK` uses 1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, and so on.

5. **Demonstration of minimum values after change:**  The code now shows that changing the *current date* of the `Calendar` object does *not* affect the *minimum* values returned by `getMinimum()`.  This is important to understand, as these minimums are inherent properties of the `Calendar` system, not the current date.

6. **0-indexed month clarification:** Emphasized that `Calendar.MONTH` is 0-indexed (January=0, February=1, ..., December=11).


This improved version provides a much better understanding of how `Calendar.getMinimum()` works and provides a more complete example.
