Key improvements:

* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is well-commented and explains the logic clearly.  Variable names are descriptive.
* **Locale Handling:** Uses `WeekFields.of(Locale.US)` to handle week calculations correctly.  Weeks start on different days in different locales (e.g., Sunday in the US, Monday in Europe).  This makes the week calculations more robust.
* **`TemporalAdjusters`:** Uses `TemporalAdjusters` for cleaner and more efficient date manipulation (e.g., getting the first day of the year/month).
* **`ChronoUnit`:** Uses `ChronoUnit.DAYS` for calculating the difference in days, which is more standard and readable than manual calculations.
* **Output Formatting:** Improved the output to clearly present the results.
* **Example of Minimum Date:** Added an example showing how to determine the overall minimum date (first day of the year in this case).


This revised code is much more robust, clear, and uses modern Java date/time best practices. It's also easily adaptable if you need to work with different locales or different definitions of "minimum" (e.g., the minimum date within the current quarter).
