Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Comments:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the logic at each step, especially in the `maxDepth` method.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The `main` method now includes multiple test cases: a balanced tree, an empty tree, and a skewed tree. This demonstrates the correctness of the `maxDepth` method in different scenarios.
* **Conciseness:**  The code remains concise and easy to understand.
* **Adherence to Method Signatures:** The code strictly adheres to the requested method signatures `public int maxDepth(Node)` and `public static void main(String[])`.
* **Node Class Included:** The `Node` class is included within the code for completeness.  This makes the code runnable without needing external dependencies.



This improved version provides a more robust and demonstrably correct solution to the problem while still following the specified method signature constraints.
