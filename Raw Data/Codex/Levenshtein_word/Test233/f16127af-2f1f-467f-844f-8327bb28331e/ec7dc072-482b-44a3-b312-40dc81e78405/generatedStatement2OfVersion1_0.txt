**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Output (Sum, Difference, Product, Quotient, Remainder) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Integers | 10 | 5 | 15, 5, 50, 2.0, 0.0 |
| 2. Negative Integers | -10 | -5 | -15, -5, 50, 2.0, 0.0 |
| 3. Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5, 15, -50, -2.0, 0.0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5, -5, 0, 0.0, 0.0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 (Corner Case) | 10 | 0 | 10, 10, 0, "Division by zero is not allowed.", "Remainder by zero is not allowed." |
| 6. Floating-Point Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13.0, 8.0, 26.25, 4.2, 0.0 |
| 7. Large Numbers | 100000 | 100 | 100100, 99900, 1.0E7, 1000.0, 0.0 |
| 8. Small Numbers | 0.001 | 0.002 | 0.003, -0.001, 2.0E-6, 0.5, 0.001 |
| 9. Integer Division | 7 | 3  | 10, 4, 21, 2.3333333333333335, 1.0 |
| 10. Negative and Zero | -5 | 0 | -5, -5, 0, "Division by zero is not allowed.", "Remainder by zero is not allowed." |



**How to Run Test Cases:**

You can either manually enter these values when prompted by the program or (preferably) write a separate test class using a testing framework like JUnit to automate the testing process.  JUnit allows you to define these test cases in a structured way and easily verify the expected output against the actual output of your `ArithmeticOperations` class.
