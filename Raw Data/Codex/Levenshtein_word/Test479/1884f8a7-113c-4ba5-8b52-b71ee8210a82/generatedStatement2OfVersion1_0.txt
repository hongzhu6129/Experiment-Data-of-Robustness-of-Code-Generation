Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:** Includes checks for `null` and strings shorter than 2 characters.
* **Clearer logic:** Uses `indexOf` to ensure we are checking the *first* occurrence of a character.
* **More comprehensive test cases:** The `main` method demonstrates different scenarios, including edge cases and cases where a character appears twice but not consecutively at its first occurrence.
* **Concise and efficient:** Avoids unnecessary iterations or nested loops.
