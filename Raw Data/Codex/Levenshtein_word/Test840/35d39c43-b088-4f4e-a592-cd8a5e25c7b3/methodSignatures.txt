 Only use the method signatures public static void main(String[]), public static boolean isPrime(int), public static int circulate_func(int, int) to generate code for the problem description: write a Java program to check if a given number is a circular prime or not. circular prime: a circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number generated at each intermediate take when cyclically permuting its (base 10) digits will be prime. for example, 1193 is a circular prime, since 1931, 9311 and 3119 all are also prime. a circular prime with at least two digits can only consist of combinations of the digits 1, 3, 7 or 9, because having 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 as the last digit makes the number divisible by 2, and having 0 or 5 as the last digit makes it divisible by 5. input data: input a number: 35it is not a circular prime number.
The programming language is Java.
