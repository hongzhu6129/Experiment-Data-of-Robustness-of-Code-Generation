Explanation and Educational Enhancements:

1. **Input Handling:** The `convertBinaryToOctal` method now takes the binary number as a `String` argument.  This is more user-friendly for an educational example.
2. **Error Handling:**  A `try-catch` block is included to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters an invalid binary string (e.g., containing characters other than '0' or '1'). This makes the code more robust.
3. **Clear Output:** The output is formatted to clearly show the binary input and the corresponding octal output.
4. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `convertBinaryToOctal` method with several example binary numbers, including longer ones and examples with a mix of 1s and 0s, showcasing different scenarios.
5. **Step-by-Step Comments:** Comments explain each step of the conversion process: binary to decimal, then decimal to octal.
6. **Integer.parseInt(String s, int radix):**  This built-in Java method efficiently parses a string `s` representing a number in a given `radix` (base) and converts it to an integer. We use radix 2 for binary.
7. **Integer.toOctalString(int i):** This convenient method directly converts an integer `i` to its octal string representation.


How to Compile and Run:

1. Save the code as `BinaryToOctal.java`.
2. Compile: `javac BinaryToOctal.java`
3. Run: `java BinaryToOctal`
