**Test Cases:**

1. **Positive Radius:**
   - Input: 7.5
   - Expected Output:
     - Perimeter is = 47.123889803846898
     - Area is = 176.71458676442586

2. **Zero Radius:**
   - Input: 0
   - Expected Output:
     - Perimeter is = 0.0
     - Area is = 0.0

3. **Negative Radius (Corner Case):**
   - Input: -5
   - Expected Output: "Radius cannot be negative." (and the program should terminate)

4. **Very Large Radius (Boundary Case):**
   - Input: 1e10  (10 billion)
   - Expected Output:  (Check for potential overflow issues; output will be very large)

5. **Very Small Radius (Boundary Case):**
   - Input: 1e-10 (a very small fraction)
   - Expected Output: (Check for potential underflow or precision issues; output will be very small)


**How to run the test cases:**

1. **Manual Testing:** You can manually run the program and enter these inputs one by one to verify the output.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  You can create unit tests using JUnit (or a similar testing framework) to automate the process.  This is a much better approach for larger projects. Here's a basic example using JUnit:
