Using JUnit (or a similar testing framework) makes it much easier to run your tests repeatedly and ensures that your code continues to work as expected as you make changes.  You can run JUnit tests directly within most IDEs (like IntelliJ or Eclipse).


Key improvements in this version of the code and test cases:

* **`input.close()`:** Closing the `Scanner` prevents resource leaks.
* **Separate `calculateAverage` method:** This makes the code more modular and testable.
* **Comprehensive test cases:**  Including corner cases like `Double.MAX_VALUE`, `Double.MIN_VALUE`, `Infinity`, and `NaN` helps identify potential issues with overflow or unexpected input.
* **JUnit example:**  Provides a practical example of how to create automated tests.  Automated testing is crucial for maintaining code quality.
