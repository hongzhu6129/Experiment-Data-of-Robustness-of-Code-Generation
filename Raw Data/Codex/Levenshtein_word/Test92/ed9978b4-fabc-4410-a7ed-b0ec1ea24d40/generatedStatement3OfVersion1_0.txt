With JUnit, you can easily run all the tests and quickly identify any issues.  This is especially helpful for regression testing when you make changes to your code. You can add this testing class in same project along with `AverageCalculator.java`.  Many IDEs (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) have built-in support for JUnit.


This comprehensive set of test cases and the demonstration of automated testing provides a more robust solution to ensuring the correctness of the `AverageCalculator` program.
