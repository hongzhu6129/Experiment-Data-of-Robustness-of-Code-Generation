**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering normal scenarios and corner cases:

| Test Case | Input (num1, num2, num3) | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10, 20, 30 | 20.0 | Basic positive numbers |
| 2 | -5, 0, 5 | 0.0 | Includes negative and zero |
| 3 | 0, 0, 0 | 0.0 | All zeros |
| 4 | 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 | 2.5 | Decimal numbers |
| 5 | Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE |  Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY | Positive overflow (Java handles this gracefully with doubles) |
| 6 | Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE | Integer.MIN_VALUE (converted to double) |  Negative overflow (handled in doubles) |
| 7 | Double.MAX_VALUE, Double.MAX_VALUE, 0 | Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY | Overflow with doubles (Java handles this gracefully with doubles, resulting in Infinity) |
| 8 | Double.NaN, 1, 2 | NaN | Input with NaN results in NaN|
| 9 | 1, Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY, 2 | Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY | Infinity in input leads to Infinity in output |
| 10 | "a", 2, 3 | "Invalid input. Please enter numbers only." | Invalid input (non-numeric characters) � The program handles this gracefully.  |



**How to run the tests (Manually):**

1.  **Compile:** Save the code as `AverageCalculator.java` and compile it: `javac AverageCalculator.java`
2.  **Run:**  `java AverageCalculator`
3.  Enter the input values as prompted.  Compare the program's output with the expected output in the test case table.


**Improving Testability (using JUnit):**

For more robust testing, especially in larger projects, it's highly recommended to use a testing framework like JUnit. Here's an example of how you could write a JUnit test for the `calculateAverage` method:
