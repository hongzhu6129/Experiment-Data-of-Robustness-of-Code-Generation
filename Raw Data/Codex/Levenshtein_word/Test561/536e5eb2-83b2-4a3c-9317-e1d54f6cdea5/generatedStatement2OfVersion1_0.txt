Key Improvements:

* **Handles n <= 1:** The code now correctly handles cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1, returning 0 as per the definition of proper divisors.
* **Efficiency:** Uses `i * i <= n` in the loop condition for optimized divisor checking.
* **Handles Perfect Squares:** Avoids adding the square root twice for perfect squares.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Uses more descriptive variable names (e.g., `proper_Divs_Sum` to `properDivisorSum`).
* **Example Usage in `main`:** Demonstrates how to call the function and print the results.
* **Comments:**  Includes comments to explain the logic.
* **Optional Divisor Printing:**  Shows how to print the list of divisors if needed (commented out by default).
* **Long Return Type:**  Uses `Long` as the return type to accommodate potentially larger sums, especially for large input values of `n`.



This improved version is more robust, efficient, and easier to understand.  It addresses the potential issues with the original code and provides a clear and concise solution for calculating the sum of proper divisors.
