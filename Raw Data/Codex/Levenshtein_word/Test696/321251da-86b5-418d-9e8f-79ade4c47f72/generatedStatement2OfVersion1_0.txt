Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles Negative and Zero Inputs:** The code now correctly handles negative input by returning -1 (you could also throw an exception if that's preferred). It also handles the zero case correctly.
- **Clearer Comments:**  Comments explain the purpose of each part of the code, making it easier to understand.
- **More Test Cases:** The `main` method demonstrates the function with several examples, including negative and zero inputs, which help verify that it works correctly.
- **Better Initial Guess:** Starting with `number / 2.0f` as the initial guess can improve convergence speed, especially for larger numbers.  You could further improve the initial guess for even faster convergence in some cases, but for a basic example this is good.
