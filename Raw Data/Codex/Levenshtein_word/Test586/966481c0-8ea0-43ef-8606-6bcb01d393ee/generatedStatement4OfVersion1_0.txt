2. **Character Encoding:** (Especially important if using different operating systems or consoles) Ensure your console/terminal supports the characters used (', [, ], |, o, ^, -, +). If you see distorted output, it might be an encoding issue.  Try using a unicode-aware console.

3. **Output Redirection:** Test redirecting the output to a file.  The face should be correctly written to the file.  This tests that the program's output is being sent to the standard output stream correctly.  You can use a command like this in your terminal:  `java FacePrinter > face.txt`

4. **No Input Required:** This program doesn't take any input.  Confirm that running it without any command-line arguments produces the expected output.


**Automated Testing (using JUnit - more advanced):**

While visual inspection is the most straightforward approach, you can use JUnit (or other testing frameworks) to automate testing output if needed. This is slightly more complex because it involves comparing strings.
