.Adding 10 and 5 without arithmetic operators:
Result: 15

Adding -5 and 3 without arithmetic operators:
Result: -2

Step-by-step example with 2 and 3:
Initial values: a = 2, b = 3
Carry (a & b): 2
Sum without carry (a ^ b): 1
Shifted carry (carry << 1): 4
Now a = 1, b = 4
Carry (a & b): 0
Sum without carry (a ^ b): 5
Shifted carry (carry << 1): 0
Final result: 5
.
Time: 0.363
