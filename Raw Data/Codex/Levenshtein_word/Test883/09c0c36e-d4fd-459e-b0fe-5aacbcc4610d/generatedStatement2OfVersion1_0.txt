Here's how this code adheres to the prompt's restrictions and addresses potential issues:

1. **`public static void main(String[] args)` Only:** The entire logic resides within the `main` method, as requested.

2. **User Input:**  It uses a `Scanner` to collect elements from the user until they type "done". This makes the program interactive.

3. **ArrayList for Dynamic Size:**  An `ArrayList` is used to store the elements.  ArrayLists are more flexible than arrays because they can grow or shrink as needed.

4. **Handles Empty List:**  The code checks if the list is empty *before* attempting to remove an element, preventing potential `IndexOutOfBoundsException` errors.

5. **Clear Output:**  It clearly indicates the removed element and prints the updated list (or a message if the list becomes empty after removal).

6. **Resource Management:** The `scanner.close()` line closes the `Scanner` to release system resources, which is good practice.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `RemoveFirstElement.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac RemoveFirstElement.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with: `java RemoveFirstElement`


The program will then prompt you to enter elements.
