Key improvements and explanations:

* **Input Validation:** The code now checks if `startYear` is greater than `endYear`. If it is, it prints an error message and exits gracefully, preventing unexpected behavior.
* **Clearer Prompts:**  User prompts are more descriptive, making it easier to understand what input is expected.
* **Inclusive Calculation (up to endYear - 1):** The loop now iterates up to `endYear -1` (exclusive of the end year) to correctly calculate the number of days *between* the start and end years.  If you intend to include the full end year as well, change the loop to `year <= endYear`.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` after it's no longer needed, which is good practice for preventing resource leaks.
* **Method Signatures Followed:** The code adheres strictly to the specified method signatures: `main`, `number_of_days`, and `is_Leap_Year`.
