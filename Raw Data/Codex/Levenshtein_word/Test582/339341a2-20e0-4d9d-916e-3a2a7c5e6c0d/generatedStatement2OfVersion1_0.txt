**Test Cases:**

1. **Positive Number:**
   - Input: 12345
   - Expected Output: 15

2. **Negative Number:**
   - Input: -9876
   - Expected Output: 30  (The function handles negative numbers correctly)

3. **Single Digit Number:**
   - Input: 7
   - Expected Output: 7

4. **Zero:**
   - Input: 0
   - Expected Output: 0

5. **Large Number:**
   - Input: 1234567890
   - Expected Output: 45

6. **Number with repeating digits:**
   - Input: 11111
   - Expected Output: 5

7. **Number with leading zeros (if input is taken as a string):**  (Although the provided code takes integer input, it's good practice to consider this for string input scenarios).
   - Input: "000123" (as a string)
   - Expected Output: 6 (If you were processing string input, leading zeros would need to be handled appropriately).



**Explanation of the Code and Improvements:**

* **Handles Negative Numbers:** The code uses `Math.abs(n)` to handle negative integers correctly. This ensures that the sum of digits is calculated regardless of the sign.

* **Clear Variable Names:** Using meaningful variable names like `sum` and `number` improves readability.

* **Scanner Closure:**  The `scanner.close()` statement is included to release the resource held by the Scanner object, which is good practice.


**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SumOfDigits.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Compile the code using:  `javac SumOfDigits.java`
3. **Run:** Run the compiled code using: `java SumOfDigits`
4. **Input:** Enter each test case input when prompted.
5. **Verify:** Check if the output matches the expected output for each test case.


This improved code and comprehensive set of test cases provides a robust solution for calculating the sum of an integer's digits in Java.
