**Explanation of Corner Cases and how they are handled:**

* **Negative Numbers:** The `Math.abs(n)` function within the `function` method handles negative numbers by taking their absolute value before calculating the sum of digits. This ensures that the sum is calculated correctly regardless of the sign.

* **Zero:** The `while (n > 0)` loop condition correctly handles the case where the input is zero. The loop will not execute, and the initial value of `sum` (which is 0) will be returned.

* **Single Digit:**  The loop will execute only once, adding the single digit to the sum and then exiting. This handles single-digit inputs correctly.


This improved version provides clear handling of various scenarios, including negative numbers and zero, making it more robust and reliable. The test cases cover a range of inputs to ensure comprehensive testing.
