**Test Cases:**

While this program doesn't take any input, we can still think about testing in terms of verifying the output.  We should confirm the correct formatting, including:

1. **Correct Text:** Ensure the poem's text is reproduced accurately (including capitalization and punctuation).  Specifically, ensure the correction from "one" to "a" in the fourth line is implemented.
2. **Correct Indentation:**  The second, third, and fourth lines should have one tab, two tabs, and two tabs of indentation, respectively.  The final two lines repeat the first two lines' formatting.
3. **Newlines:** Check that each line correctly ends with a newline character, resulting in the desired visual structure.


**How to Test (Conceptual):**

1. **Visual Inspection:**  The simplest approach is to run the program and visually compare the output to the expected output.

2. **Output Redirection (for automated testing):**  You could redirect the program's output to a file and then compare that file's contents to a file containing the expected output.  This is how automated tests would typically be handled.  Here's a basic example using bash (though you could do similar things in other scripting languages):
