Key improvements and explanations in this code:

1. **Clearer Example Usage:**  Provides two example usages, including one that demonstrates handling an invalid index.
2. **Input Validation:** The code now checks if the `indexToUpdate` is within the valid bounds of the array. This prevents `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` errors, making the code more robust.
3. **Informative Output:**  It prints the updated array to the console to verify the change and also includes a message if the index is invalid, explaining why the array wasn't modified.
4. **Comments:** Added more comments to make the purpose of each section of the code clearer.
5. **Better Formatting:** Improved spacing and indentation for better readability.
