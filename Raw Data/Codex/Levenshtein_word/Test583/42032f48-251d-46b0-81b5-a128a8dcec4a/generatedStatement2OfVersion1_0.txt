Key improvements and explanations in this version:

* **Handles Edge Cases**: Explicitly handles `null` or empty input arrays, returning 0 in these cases. This makes the function more robust.

* **Clearer Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` is a more descriptive name than `k`, indicating its purpose.

* **In-Place Modification**:  Modifies the original `nums` array directly as required, without using extra space.

* **Comprehensive `main` method:** Includes several test cases demonstrating the function's behavior with different inputs, including edge cases (empty array, null input). The output also clearly shows the updated array content alongside the length.

* **Efficiency**: The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates through the array once.  It meets the O(1) space complexity requirement.

* **Doc comments**:  Added Javadoc style comments to explain the purpose of the `removeDuplicates` method, making it easier to understand.



This improved version addresses the original prompt's requirements and offers better clarity, robustness, and testing.
