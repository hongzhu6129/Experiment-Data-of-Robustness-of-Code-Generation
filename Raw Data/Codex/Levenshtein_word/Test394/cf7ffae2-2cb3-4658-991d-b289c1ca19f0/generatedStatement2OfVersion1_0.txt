Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  Empty array, single-element array, and `null` input are now correctly handled.
- **Clearer variable names:**  `uniqueCount` is more descriptive than `j`.
- **In-place modification:** The function modifies the original array `nums` directly as requested, overwriting the duplicate elements.
- **Comprehensive test cases:** The `main` method includes various test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior.
- **Output formatting:** The output clearly shows the updated length and the modified array (using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid displaying the remaining elements that are not part of the unique portion).  It also handles the `null` input case gracefully.
