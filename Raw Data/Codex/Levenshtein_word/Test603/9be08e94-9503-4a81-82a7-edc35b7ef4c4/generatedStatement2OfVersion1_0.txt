Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles exceptions gracefully:** The code now uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions`.  This prevents the program from crashing and provides a user-friendly error message.
* **Preserves original line breaks:** The `newLine()` method is used to ensure that the original line breaks in the input file are maintained in the output file.
* **Creates a new output file:**  Instead of overwriting the original file, the emblazoned text is written to a new file with the extension ".emblazoned". This protects the original data.
* **Uses `try-with-resources`:** This ensures that the `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` are closed automatically, even if an exception occurs. This prevents resource leaks.
* **Prompts for user input:**  The program now prompts the user for the file path and the text to emblazon, making it more interactive.
* **Closes the scanner:** Prevents resource leaks.



**How to compile and run:**

1. Save the code as `EmblazonText.java`.
2. Compile: `javac EmblazonText.java`
3. Run: `java EmblazonText`


The program will then ask you for the file path and the text to emblazon.  The output will be written to a new file with the ".emblazoned" extension.


Example:

If your existing file (`myFile.txt`) contains:
