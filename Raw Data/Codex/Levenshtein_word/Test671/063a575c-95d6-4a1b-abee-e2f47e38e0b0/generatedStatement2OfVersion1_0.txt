Key improvements:

- **Handles edge cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays and null input.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` makes the code easier to understand.
- **Improved efficiency:** The code iterates through the array only once.
- **Comprehensive `main` method:**  Demonstrates the function's behavior with various test cases, including edge cases like empty and null arrays, and prints the resulting arrays for verification.
- Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant portion of the modified array in `main`. This avoids printing the unchanged (and potentially duplicate) elements beyond the new length.


This revised solution adheres to the requested method signatures and effectively solves the problem while being robust and easy to understand.
