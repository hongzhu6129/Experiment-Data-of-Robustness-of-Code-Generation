**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Prompts:** The code now uses clear prompts to ask the user for input, making it more user-friendly.

2. **Scanner for Input:** A `Scanner` object is used to efficiently read integer input from the user.

3. **`abc` Condition:**  The condition `abc = "abc"` is implemented correctly using string comparison (`.equals()`). Note that in Java, string comparisons should always use `.equals()` and not `==`. `==` compares memory addresses of string objects and not the actual string contents.

4. **Logical AND and OR:** The logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators are used correctly to combine the conditions as specified in the prompt.

5. **Simplified Logic:**  Since `abc` will always be true because `"abc".equals("abc")` is always true, the condition `(abc || (num2 > num1))` simplifies to `true`.  Therefore, the final logic effectively becomes:  `result = (num3 > num2);`

6. **Resource Management:** The `scanner.close();` line is added to close the `Scanner` object, releasing system resources. This is good practice.

7. **Clear Output:** The program prints the boolean result (`true` or `false`) to the console.
