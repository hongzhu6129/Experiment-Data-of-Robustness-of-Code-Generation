**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **StringLengthComparator:** This separate inner class implements the `Comparator<String>` interface.  This is best practice for custom comparators, making the code more organized and reusable.

2. **compare() Method:** The `compare()` method inside `StringLengthComparator` now uses `Integer.compare()` for a cleaner and more robust comparison of string lengths. It handles potential integer overflow issues more effectively than manual subtraction.

3. **TreeMap Initialization:** The `TreeMap` is initialized directly with the `StringLengthComparator` instance.

4. **Clearer Output:** The `main` method now prints the sorted `TreeMap` in a more readable format and includes examples demonstrating how the `compare()` method works.

5. **Adherence to Method Signature Requirements:**  The code strictly adheres to the requested method signatures: `public static void main(String[])` and `public int compare(String, String)`.  The `compare()` method is within the `StringLengthComparator` class.


This improved version is more efficient, robust, and easier to understand and maintain. It also explicitly demonstrates the use of the `compare()` method.
