**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clarity and Comments:**  Added comments to explain the purpose of each section of code, making it easier to understand what's happening.

2. **Demonstrating Bidirectional Updates:**  The code demonstrates how changes made through the `mapView` affect the `originalMap` AND how changes to the `originalMap` are reflected in the `mapView`. This is crucial for understanding how views work.

3. **Correct Removal with `Map.entry()`:** Using `Map.entry("banana", 2)` in the `remove()` method is essential. It creates an `Entry` object for comparison, ensuring that the entry with both the correct key AND value is removed.

4. **Iteration Example:** Included an example of how to iterate through the `mapView` using a for-each loop and access the key-value pairs using `entry.getKey()` and `entry.getValue()`.

5. **`entrySet()` for Mappings View:** The `entrySet()` method is the correct way to obtain a view of the mappings (key-value pairs) of a map.

6. **Output for Clarity:** The output statements clearly show the state of both the original map and the view before and after modifications, illustrating the linked nature of the view.
