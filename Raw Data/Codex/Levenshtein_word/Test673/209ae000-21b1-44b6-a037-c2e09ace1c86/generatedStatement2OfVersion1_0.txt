Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueIndex` is used instead of `j` to improve readability.  This makes the code's purpose more self-explanatory.
2. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles the cases of an empty or null input array, preventing potential `NullPointerException` errors.
3. **In-Place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` method modifies the original array `nums` directly as requested by LeetCode.  The elements beyond the `uniqueIndex` are not relevant anymore.
4. **Return Value:**  The function correctly returns the length of the updated array (the number of unique elements).
5. **Comprehensive Testing in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates the function's usage with various test cases, including empty and null arrays,  and it now prints the updated array content using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to clearly visualize the results.  This ensures that the code is robust and works as intended in different scenarios.



This improved version addresses the potential issues of the previous version and follows LeetCode's in-place modification requirement while adhering to the specified method signatures.
