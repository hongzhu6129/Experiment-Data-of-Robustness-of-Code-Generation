Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles `null` inputs:** The `removeString` method now checks for `null` values for `mainString` and `removeString`.  This prevents `NullPointerExceptions`.  You can modify it to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` or return an empty string if you prefer different behavior for null inputs.
2. **Uses `String.replace()`:** The most efficient way to remove all occurrences of a substring is to use the built-in `replace()` method.
3. **Clearer `main()` method:**  The `main()` method provides several examples to demonstrate the functionality with different inputs, including edge cases (removing strings that don't exist, handling `nulls`).  This helps thoroughly test the code.
4. **Explanatory Comments:**  The code is well-commented to explain what each part does.
