**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **File Handling:** The code now reads the text from a file named "input.txt".  **Important:** Replace `"input.txt"` with the actual path to your file.
2. **Error Handling:**  A `try-catch` block handles potential `IOExceptions` during file reading.  If an error occurs, an error message is printed, and an empty string is returned.
3. **Splitting Words:** The `line.split("\\s+")` splits the line into words based on whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).
4. **Handling Non-Alphabetic Characters:**  `word.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z]", "")` removes any non-alphabetic characters from the words (punctuation, numbers, etc.) to ensure accurate length comparisons.
5. **Multiple Longest Words:** The code now correctly handles cases where there are multiple words with the same maximum length. They are all added to the `longestWords` list.
6. **Empty Words:** The code also avoids adding empty words (that might result after removing non-alphabetic characters) to the list of longest words using `!word.isEmpty()`.
7. **Clear List When a Longer Word is Found:**  The `longestWords` list is cleared when a word longer than the current `maxLength` is found to ensure that the list only contains the longest word(s).
8. **Returning a String:** The `findLongestWords()` method now returns a comma-separated string of the longest words.



**How to Use:**

1. **Create `input.txt`:** Create a text file named "input.txt" (or whatever you named it in the code) in the same directory as your Java file. Put the text you want to analyze in this file.
2. **Compile and Run:** Compile and run the Java code. The longest word(s) will be printed to the console.
