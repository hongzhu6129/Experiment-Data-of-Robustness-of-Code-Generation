This code uses the `NumberFormat` class with the US locale to format the number.  This automatically adds thousand separators according to the conventions of the specified locale.  If you need a different locale's formatting, you can change `Locale.US` to the desired locale (e.g., `Locale.GERMANY`, `Locale.FRANCE`, etc.).  The `NumberFormat` class handles negative numbers and zero correctly as well.


Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles different locales:** Using `NumberFormat` makes it adaptable to various number formatting conventions.
* **Clearer and more concise:** The code is now much simpler and easier to understand.
* **Correct handling of negative numbers and zero:**  The `NumberFormat` class handles these cases automatically.
* **Uses standard library:** Leverages the built-in Java libraries for better efficiency and maintainability.
