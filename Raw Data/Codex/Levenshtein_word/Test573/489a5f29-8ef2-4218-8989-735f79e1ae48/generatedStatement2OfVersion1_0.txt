Key improvements:

* **Handles corner cases:** The code explicitly checks for `null` arrays and arrays with lengths less than 2, returning `false` in these cases.  This prevents `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` or `NullPointerException`.
* **Clearer method:** The `isFirstLastEqual` method is now more focused and easier to understand.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Includes various scenarios including arrays with matching first and last elements, different lengths,  and the essential corner cases (null and empty arrays).
* **Uses Arrays.toString():** Makes the output more readable by printing the array contents along with the result.



This improved version is more robust and provides better error handling, making it suitable for a wider range of inputs.
