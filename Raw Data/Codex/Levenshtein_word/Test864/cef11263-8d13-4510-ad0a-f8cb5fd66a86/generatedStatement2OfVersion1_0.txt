Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays and null inputs.
* **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex`  is more descriptive than just `i`.
* **Comprehensive testing in `main`:**  The `main` method now tests with various inputs, including edge cases like empty and null arrays, and single element arrays, demonstrating the robustness of the solution.
* **Output formatting:** The output in `main` now clearly displays the new length and the relevant portion of the modified array using `Arrays.copyOfRange`.  This makes it easier to verify the correctness of the `removeDuplicates` method.
