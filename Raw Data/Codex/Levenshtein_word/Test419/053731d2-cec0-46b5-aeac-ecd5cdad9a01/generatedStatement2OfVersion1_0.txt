Explanation:

1. **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `b` becomes 0. In this case, the product is 0.

2. **Positive b:** If `b` is positive, we recursively call `multiply_two_nums` with `b-1` and add `a` to the result. This effectively adds `a` to itself `b` times.

3. **Negative b:** If `b` is negative, we negate the result of the recursive call with `-b`. This handles multiplication with negative numbers correctly.

Key improvements over previous responses:

* **Handles negative numbers correctly:** The code now correctly calculates the product for both positive and negative inputs for `b`.
* **Clearer base case:** The base case `b == 0` is more explicit and easier to understand.
* **More efficient for negative b:**  Avoids unnecessary recursive calls when `b` is negative.

This revised approach meets the specified restrictions (no multiplication, division, modulo, or loops) and provides a correct and efficient implementation of integer multiplication using recursion.
