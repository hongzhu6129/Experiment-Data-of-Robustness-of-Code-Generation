Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles Empty Arrays:** It explicitly checks if the arrays are empty before accessing elements, preventing `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.  This makes the code much more robust.
* **Clearer Output:**  The output now clearly shows the first and last elements of each array, making it easier to understand the comparison results.
* **Added Examples:** Demonstrates how the code handles both empty arrays and the case where one array is empty and the other is not. This illustrates the importance of the length check.


This revised answer addresses the potential error and makes the code more practical and understandable.
