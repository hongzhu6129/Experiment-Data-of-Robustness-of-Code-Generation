Key improvements:

- **Handles null cases:** Correctly handles scenarios where one or both trees are null.
- **Clearer code:**  Improved variable names (p, q) are common for comparing trees.
- **Comprehensive testing:** The `main` method includes examples demonstrating different scenarios (identical trees, different structures, different values, null trees).
- **Concise comments:**  Explaining the logic makes it more understandable.
