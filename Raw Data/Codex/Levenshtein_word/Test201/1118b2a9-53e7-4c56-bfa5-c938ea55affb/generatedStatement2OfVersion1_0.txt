Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Generics:** The `editElement` method now uses generics `<T>` to handle PriorityQueues of any type (Integer, String, custom objects, etc.), making it more versatile.

2. **Error Handling:** Added a check (`pq.contains(oldElement)`) and a print statement to handle cases where the element to be edited is not found in the queue. This prevents unexpected behavior.

3. **Clearer Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `editElement` method with both `Integer` and `String` PriorityQueues.

4. **Explanation:** The core logic of editing in a PriorityQueue is simple:
   - Remove the old element.
   - Add the new element.
   The PriorityQueue automatically re-heapifies (re-orders itself) after each add and remove operation to maintain its order based on the natural ordering or a provided comparator.  Therefore, simply removing and adding achieves the desired edit functionality.
