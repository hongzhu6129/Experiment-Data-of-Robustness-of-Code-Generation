Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is now formatted for better readability, with comments explaining each step.
* **Explicit Output:** The output now clearly states "Yes" or "No" to answer the "is lucky number?" question.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed at the end of the `main` method to release resources.
* **Efficiency:** Using a `HashSet` provides constant-time (O(1)) average-case performance for `add` and `contains` operations, making the check for duplicate digits efficient.


This improved version addresses the prompt's requirements directly and provides a more robust and understandable solution.
