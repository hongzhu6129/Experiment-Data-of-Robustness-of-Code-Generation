**Explanation and Test Cases:**

1. **`listCharsets()` function:** This function retrieves the available charsets using `Charset.availableCharsets()` (which returns a `SortedMap`). It then iterates through the map, printing the charset's canonical name and its aliases.

2. **Test Cases in `main()`:**
   - **`testContains()`:** Tests whether specific charsets are present using `containsKey()`. Includes tests for common charsets ("UTF-8", "UTF-16", "ISO-8859-1", "US-ASCII"), as well as corner cases:
     - Empty string (`""`) - should return `false`.
     - `null` input - Should be handled gracefully (either return `false` or explicitly catch the `NullPointerException`).  The code now catches and handles the `NullPointerException`.
   - **`testAliases()`:** Checks if the aliases for a given charset are retrieved correctly.
   - **`testAvailableCharsetsNotEmpty()`:** This is an essential test. It verifies that `Charset.availableCharsets()` actually returns something and isn't empty, which would indicate a problem with the Java environment.



**How to Run:**

1. Save the code as `ListAvailableCharsets.java`.
2. Compile: `javac ListAvailableCharsets.java`
3. Run: `java ListAvailableCharsets`


**Key Improvements and Corner Case Handling:**

* **Null Handling:**  The `testContains()` function now explicitly handles `null` input, which is a very important corner case to consider.
* **Empty String:** Testing with an empty string helps verify that the code correctly handles this boundary condition.
* **`testAvailableCharsetsNotEmpty()`:**  This is crucial to ensure that your Java environment is functioning as expected.  It helps prevent unexpected behavior if the charset map is empty for some reason.
* **Clearer Output:** Test output now clearly states what is being tested and the expected result. This makes it easier to understand and debug if something goes wrong.


This improved version provides a more robust solution by addressing important corner cases and enhancing testability.  It's good practice to always include tests for boundaries, invalid inputs, and to check for unexpected environmental issues.
