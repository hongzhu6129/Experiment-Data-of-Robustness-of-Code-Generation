Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  Uses more descriptive variable names (like `numDigits` instead of `n`).  The code is generally easier to follow.
* **Handles Overflow:**  Uses `long` to calculate the powers of digits. This prevents potential integer overflow issues that could occur with very large "sociopathic" numbers (although the first 15 are small enough that overflow wasn't an immediate problem in the original code).
* **Efficiency (Minor):** Uses `Character.getNumericValue()` which is a bit more direct than parsing each digit as a string. This is a small optimization.
* **Adherence to Prompt:** Strictly adheres to the requirement of only using `main` and `is_narc_dec_num` methods.


This revised solution addresses the potential overflow issue and improves overall code quality, while adhering to the prompt's method signature restrictions.
