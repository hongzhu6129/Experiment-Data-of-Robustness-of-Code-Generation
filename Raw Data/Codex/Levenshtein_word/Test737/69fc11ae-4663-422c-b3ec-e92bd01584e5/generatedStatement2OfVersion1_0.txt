Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Clearer variable names:**  Using names like `leftDepth`, `midDepth`, and `rightDepth` enhances readability.
* **Simplified logic:** The use of `Math.max` within `Math.max` makes the code concise and easier to follow.
* **Comprehensive main method:** The inclusion of test cases, including an empty tree and a single-node tree, makes the code more robust and demonstrates its handling of different scenarios.
* **Conciseness:**  Removed unnecessary comments and kept the code focused on the core logic.
* **Adherence to prompt:** Strictly adheres to the requested method signatures.


This revised code effectively computes the maximum depth of a ternary tree, is easy to understand, and includes thorough test cases to validate its correctness.
