Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer prime checking:** The `prime_cell` function is simplified and more efficient. It uses a `count` variable to track if either number is not prime.
* **Direct boolean assignment:**  The code now directly assigns the boolean value based on the result of `prime_cell`.
* **Handles 0 and 1 correctly:** The `prime_cell` logic now implicitly handles the cases where `m` or `n` are 0 or 1 (which are not prime) correctly. No special cases are needed.
* **Formatted output:**  A newline is added at the end of the output for better readability, especially if you are using a larger matrix.
* **Example usage:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `prime_cell` function and create the 2D boolean array.  It uses `m=3` as an example, but you can easily modify this to test with different matrix sizes.
