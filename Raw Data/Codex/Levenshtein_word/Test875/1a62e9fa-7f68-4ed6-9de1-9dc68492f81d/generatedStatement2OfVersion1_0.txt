Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Comments:**  Extensive comments explain each comparison method and the expected outcomes.
* **Different Scenarios:** Demonstrates comparing lists with different sizes, contents, and order.
* **`containsAll()` Explanation:**  Shows how `containsAll()` checks for element presence regardless of order and handles potential differences in behavior.
* **Empty List Comparison:** Includes a case where both lists are empty to show that `equals()` handles this correctly.
* **Conciseness:** Removed unnecessary code or redundant explanations.  The code now focuses on the core comparison methods.
