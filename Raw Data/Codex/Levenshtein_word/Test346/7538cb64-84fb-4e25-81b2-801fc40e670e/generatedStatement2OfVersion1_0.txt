**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **Data Types:**  Use `double` for floating-point calculations to maintain precision.  Using `int` in the divisions would result in integer division (truncation).  Explicitly casting  `1` and `sign` to `double` ensures floating-point division.

2. **Order of Operations:** Parentheses are crucial to enforce the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

3. **Looping for Efficiency (Second Example):** The loop makes the code more general and efficient.  You can easily change the upper limit of the series (11 in this case) without rewriting multiple terms.

4. **Alternating Signs:** The `sign` variable is used to efficiently handle the alternating addition and subtraction in the series.

5. **Output:** `System.out.println()` displays the calculated result to the console.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FormulaCalculation.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type `javac FormulaCalculation.java`. This creates a `FormulaCalculation.class` file.
3. **Run:** Type `java FormulaCalculation` to execute the program. The output (2.9760461760461765) will be printed to the console.
