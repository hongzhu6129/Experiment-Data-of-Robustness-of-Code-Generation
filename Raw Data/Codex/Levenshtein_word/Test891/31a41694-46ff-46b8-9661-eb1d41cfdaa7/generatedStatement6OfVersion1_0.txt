**Key improvements:**

* **Handles the case where no argument is provided:**  The code now checks `args.length` to prevent a `NullPointerException` if no pathname is given. It prints a helpful message to the user.
* **Uses `java.nio.file.Files`:** This is the modern and preferred way to work with files and directories in Java.  It's more efficient and provides more features.
* **Checks for existence:** The code first checks if the path exists using `Files.exists()` before checking if it's a file or directory. This avoids potential exceptions.
* **Handles other file types:** The code now acknowledges that a path could exist but not be a regular file or directory (e.g., a symbolic link, named pipe, etc.).
* **Clearer output:** The output messages are more informative.
* **Commented-out `java.io.File` example:**  The older `java.io.File` approach is included as a comment for reference, but the `java.nio.file` approach is recommended.



This improved version is more robust and handles various scenarios correctly.
