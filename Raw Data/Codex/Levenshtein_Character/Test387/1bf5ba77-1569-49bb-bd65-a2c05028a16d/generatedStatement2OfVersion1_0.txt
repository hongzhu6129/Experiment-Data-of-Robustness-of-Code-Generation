Key improvements:

* **Clearer Error Handling:** The `main` method now demonstrates how to properly catch and handle the `NumberFormatException` that arises when you try to convert a non-numeric string (like "computer") to an integer. This addresses the error you specified in the prompt.
* **Radix Parameter:** Added an overloaded `sort(int[] arr, int radix)` method to enable sorting with bases other than 10, showcasing the flexibility of radix sort.
* **Streamlined Code:**  Minor improvements for code readability and efficiency (e.g., using `Arrays.stream` for finding the maximum element).
* **Comprehensive Comments:** Added more comments to explain the logic and purpose of different parts of the code.


This revised version not only provides a correct radix sort implementation but also demonstrates how to manage the error you were encountering, making it a more complete and robust solution.
