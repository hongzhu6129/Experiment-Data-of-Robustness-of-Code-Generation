Key improvements in this version:

* **Input Validation:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle `DateTimeParseException`.  This prevents the program from crashing if the user enters an invalid date format. It provides a clear error message.
* **Clear Prompts:**  The prompts to the user are more explicit about the expected date format.
* **Conciseness:** The code is slightly more concise while remaining readable.
* **Modern Date/Time API:** It uses the `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8), which is the preferred way to work with dates and times in modern Java.  It's much cleaner and easier to use than the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes.
* **Period.between():** Uses `Period.between()` directly to calculate the difference, which is the most straightforward approach.
