**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`calculateFermatNumber(int n)` Method:** This helper method keeps the `main` method cleaner and encapsulates the Fermat number calculation logic.

2. **Using `long`:**  Fermat numbers grow very rapidly.  `int` will overflow quickly.  While `long` also has limits, it can handle the first few Fermat numbers.

3. **Clarity and Formatting:** The code is formatted for readability with clear comments.  The output is labeled to indicate what the numbers represent.

4. **Correct Calculation:** The formula for Fermat numbers is correctly implemented as 2<sup>(2<sup>n</sup>)</sup> + 1.


**Important Note about Larger Fermat Numbers:**

Even `long` will not be able to hold Fermat numbers beyond the first few.  For larger values of `n`, you would need to use `BigInteger` (if arbitrary precision is required):
