Test cases:

* **Corner cases:**
    * `sourceString` is empty
    * `targetString` is empty
    * All characters in `sourceString` are contained in `targetString`
    * No characters in `sourceString` are contained in `targetString`
* **Regular cases:**
    * `sourceString` contains some characters that are contained in `targetString` and some characters that are not
    * `sourceString` and `targetString` have the same length
    * `sourceString` and `targetString` have different lengths
