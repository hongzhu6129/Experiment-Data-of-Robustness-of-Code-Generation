**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles 0 Remainder Correctly:** The crucial improvement is the handling of the case where `n % 26` is 0.  In Excel's column naming convention,  'Z' represents 26, 'AZ' represents 52, and so on.  The original logic failed to account for this "wrap-around" effect.  Now, if the remainder is 0, we append 'Z' and  *decrement* `n/26` by 1 to correctly represent the preceding letter.

2. **StringBuilder for Efficiency:** Uses `StringBuilder` for building the column name, which is much more efficient than repeated string concatenation using `+`.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using more descriptive variable names like `columnName` and `rem` (remainder) enhances readability.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method now includes more test cases covering various scenarios, including those that caused issues in the previous versions (e.g., 26, 52, 702).


This revised code accurately converts column numbers to their corresponding Excel column names, adhering to the correct naming pattern.
