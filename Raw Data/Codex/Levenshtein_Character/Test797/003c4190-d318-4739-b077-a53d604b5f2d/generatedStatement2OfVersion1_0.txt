**Test cases:**

**Corner cases:**

* **Empty string:** The program should handle the case where the input string is empty.
* **Character not found:** The program should handle the case where the character to search for is not found in the string.

**Other test cases:**

* **Short string with a common character:** This test case will help to measure the performance of the program for small strings.
* **Long string with a rare character:** This test case will help to measure the performance of the program for large strings and rare characters.
* **String with a repeating character:** This test case will help to measure the performance of the program when the character to search for appears multiple times in the string.

**Example test cases:**

* **Empty string:** ""
* **Character not found:** "abcdefghij" (search for 'z')
* **Short string with a common character:** "hello" (search for 'e')
* **Long string with a rare character:** "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" (search for 'x')
* **String with a repeating character:** "Mississippi" (search for 's')
