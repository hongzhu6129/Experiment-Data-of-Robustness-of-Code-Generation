This code provides three different ways to achieve the same result:

1. **Using a `for` loop:**  This is the most common and generally applicable way to sum a series.  It iterates through the numbers from 1 to 10, adding each to the `sum` variable.
2. **Using the formula:** The sum of the first `n` natural numbers can be calculated directly using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`.  This is more efficient than the loop, but less general.
3. **Illustrating the additions:** This approach prints out the entire summation expression (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10) along with the final result.  This is purely for educational purposes to visually demonstrate how the sum is calculated.


This improved answer addresses the "educational" requirement more directly by showing the summation process step-by-step in the third example. It also includes the more efficient formula-based calculation.  The output is clearly labeled to explain each method.
