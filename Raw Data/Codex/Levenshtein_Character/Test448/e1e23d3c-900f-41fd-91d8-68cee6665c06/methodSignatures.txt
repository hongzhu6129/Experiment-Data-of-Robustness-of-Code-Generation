 Only use the method signatures  to generate code for the problem description: write a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the heap sort algorithm. in computer science heapsort (invented by j. w. j. williams in 1964) is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it interactively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. the improvement consists of the use of a heap data structure rather than a linear-time search to find the maximum. although somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort, it has the advantage of a more favorable worst-case o(n log n) runtime. heapsort is an in-place algorithm, but not a stable sort.
The programming language is Java.
