## Test Cases:

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Positive Number:**
   - Input: `7`
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 7 up to 10 (7x1=7, 7x2=14, ..., 7x10=70)

2. **Zero:**
   - Input: `0`
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 0 (all results will be 0). This is a corner case.

3. **Negative Number:**
   - Input: `-5`
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of -5 (e.g., -5x1=-5, -5x2=-10, etc.).

4. **Large Positive Number:**
   - Input: `10000`
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 10000.  Tests handling of larger numbers.

5. **Large Negative Number:**
   - Input: `-20000`
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of -20000.

6. **Invalid Input (Non-Integer):**
   - Input: `abc` or `3.14`
   - Expected Output: "Invalid input. Please enter an integer." and the program should exit. This is a crucial corner case to ensure robust input handling.


**How to run the test cases:**

1. **Manual Testing:**  You can run the Java program and manually enter each of these inputs to verify the output against the expected results.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  You could write unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit.  This approach is more systematic and allows you to easily re-run the tests whenever you make changes to your code. Example using JUnit:
