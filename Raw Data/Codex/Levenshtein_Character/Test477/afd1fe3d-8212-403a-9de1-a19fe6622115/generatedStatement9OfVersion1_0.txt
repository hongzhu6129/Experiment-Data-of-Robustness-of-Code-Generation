This improved answer provides a more complete set of test cases and demonstrates how to use JUnit (which is highly recommended) for automated testing. Remember to restore `System.out` after each test to avoid interfering with other tests or output.  Using JUnit or a similar framework is the standard way to test Java code and will make your code more robust and maintainable.
