Here's how to compile and run it from the command line:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `MonthStartEnd.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac MonthStartEnd.java`
3. **Run:**  `java MonthStartEnd`  (This uses the current year and month)
4. **Run with specific year and month:** `java MonthStartEnd 2024 2` (This uses 2024 and February).



Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user provides invalid input for the year or month.  It defaults to the current date if the input is bad.
* **Clearer Output:** Uses a `DateTimeFormatter` to format the dates in `yyyy-MM-dd` format, making the output more user-friendly.
* **Command-line Arguments:**  Allows the user to specify the year and month as command-line arguments, providing more flexibility.
* **Uses `YearMonth`:** This class is specifically designed for working with year-month combinations, making the code cleaner and more efficient.  It avoids unnecessary date manipulations.
