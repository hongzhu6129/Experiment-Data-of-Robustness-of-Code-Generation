Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Comments:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the logic clearly.
* **Efficiency:** The outer loop only iterates up to the square root of `n`, which is a standard optimization for the Sieve of Eratosthenes.  The inner loop starts from `p*p` as all smaller multiples would have already been marked.
* **Returns an Array:**  The `generatePrimes` function now returns an integer array containing the prime numbers found, making it more reusable.
* **Clearer main method:** The `main` method demonstrates the usage of the `generatePrimes` method with different input values and clear output formatting.


This improved version provides a more robust, efficient, and understandable implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
