Explanation:

1. **Node Class:** Represents a node in the ternary oak.  Each node has data, and three child pointers: left, mid, and right.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):**
   - This is a recursive function.
   - **Base Case:** If the node is null (empty subtree), its depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:** Otherwise, we calculate the depth of the left, mid, and right subtrees recursively. The maximum of these depths + 1 (for the current node) is the depth of the current subtree.

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - Creates a `TernaryOakMaxDepth` object.
   - Constructs sample ternary oak trees.
   - Calls the `maxDepth()` function to calculate and print the maximum depth of the constructed trees.
