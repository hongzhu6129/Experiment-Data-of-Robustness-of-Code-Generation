Key improvements:

- **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `i` for the unique element tracker.
- **Handles Edge Cases:** Explicitly handles `null` or empty input arrays.
- **Concise Logic:** The core logic for removing duplicates is streamlined.
- **Informative Main Method:**  The `main` method demonstrates the function's usage with different test cases, including edge cases (empty and null arrays), and prints the modified array along with its new length, making it easier to understand the output.
- **Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`:**  This prevents printing the garbage values that might exist after the relevant part of the modified array in the main method's print statements.



This improved version is more robust, easier to read, and provides better demonstrations of its functionality. It also adheres to the specified method signatures.
