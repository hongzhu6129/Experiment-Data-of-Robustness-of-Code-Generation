Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Use `NavigableMap`:**  The `NavigableMap` interface (and its common implementation `TreeMap`) provides methods like `subMap()`, `tailMap()`, and `headMap()` specifically designed for getting portions of a sorted map.

2. **Clearer Example:** The code now provides a more complete and understandable example, demonstrating how to create and populate a map, and then extract a submap.  It also clearly shows how to control inclusivity/exclusivity of the start/end points.

3. **Illustrates `tailMap()`:** The example also includes the `tailMap()` method which effectively creates a submap from a given key to the end of the map.  This addresses the "from a given set to another key" part of the prompt, where the "set" can be considered a single key defining the starting point, and "another key" can be implicitly the end of the map.

4. **Handles Inclusivity/Exclusivity:**  The `subMap()` method's parameters let you specify whether the start and end keys are inclusive or exclusive in the submap, providing flexibility.

5. **Output for Clarity:** The code prints both the original map and the submap, making it easy to verify the results.

6. **Example with a "set" (using tailMap):**  The code demonstrates how to use a single value (which can be thought of as a set with one element) as the starting point using `tailMap()`. This shows both inclusive and exclusive variations.



This improved version provides a comprehensive solution to the problem, using best practices and making the code more readable and understandable.
