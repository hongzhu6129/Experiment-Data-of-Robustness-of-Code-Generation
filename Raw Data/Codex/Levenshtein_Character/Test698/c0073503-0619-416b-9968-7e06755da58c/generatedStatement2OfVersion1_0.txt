Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer output:** The output now explicitly states whether each environment variable was found or not, making the results easier to understand.
* **Platform independence for Temp/Username:** The code now checks both `TEMP`/`TMP` and `USERNAME`/`USER` environment variables, improving compatibility across different operating systems.
* **Error Handling (for environment variables):** The code now checks for `null` values returned by `System.getenv()` to prevent `NullPointerExceptions` if the environment variable is not defined.  This is a good defensive programming practice.
* **Combined in one `main` method:** Both problem solutions are within the single `main` method, as requested.
