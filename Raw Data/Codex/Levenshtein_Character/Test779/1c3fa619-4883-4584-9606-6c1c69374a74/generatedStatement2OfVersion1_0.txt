Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Includes handling for empty (`{}`) and `null` input arrays.  This makes the code more robust.
* **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `i` or `j` for its specific purpose.
* **Concise logic:** The core logic within the `removeDuplicates` method is efficient and easy to follow.
* **Informative output in `main`:** Prints the length and the *relevant portion* of the modified array using `Arrays.copyOfRange`. This gives a clearer picture of the result.  It also shows how to handle printing the array when the input might be null.
