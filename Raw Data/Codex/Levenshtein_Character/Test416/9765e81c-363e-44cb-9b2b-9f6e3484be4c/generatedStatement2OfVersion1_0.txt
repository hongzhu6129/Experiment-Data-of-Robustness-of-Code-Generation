This code fulfills all the requirements:

1. **`public static void main(String[] args)`:**  The entire logic resides within the main method.
2. **Gets day of the week:** Uses `java.time` (modern date-time API) to accurately determine the day of the week.
3. **Handles user input:** Prompts the user for a date and reads it using `Scanner`.
4. **Input validation:** Includes error handling with a `try-catch` block to manage invalid date formats.  It provides a clear error message if the user enters the date in the wrong format.
5. **Clear output:** Prints the day of the week in a user-friendly format.
