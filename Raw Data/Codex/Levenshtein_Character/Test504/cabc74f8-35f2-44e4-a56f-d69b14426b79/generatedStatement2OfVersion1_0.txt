**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **TreeSet:** The most efficient way to find the ceiling (smallest element greater than or equal to a given value) in Java is using a `TreeSet`.  TreeSets are sorted and provide the `ceiling()` method directly.

2. **Handling `null`:** The `ceiling()` method returns `null` if there's no element in the tree greater than or equal to the target.  The code includes examples demonstrating this and how to handle it.

3. **Generics:** The example demonstrates how to use `TreeSet` with both `Integer` and `String` data types, showcasing its generic nature.

4. **Clearer Examples:**  The examples cover cases where the target is present in the tree, less than the smallest element, between elements, and greater than the largest element, providing a comprehensive demonstration.

5. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the purpose of the code and the different test cases.


This revised response provides a complete, robust, and well-explained solution using the `main` method as requested, leveraging the power of `TreeSet` for efficient ceiling finding.
