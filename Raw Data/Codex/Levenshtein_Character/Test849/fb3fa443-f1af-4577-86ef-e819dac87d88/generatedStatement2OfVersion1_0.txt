Key improvements and explanations:

* **Test Cases:**  The code now includes a comprehensive set of JUnit 5 test cases.  These tests cover:
    * Positive radius:  Verifying the original example.
    * Zero radius: A boundary condition.
    * Very large radius:  Testing for potential overflow issues with `Double.MAX_VALUE`.
    * Negative radius: This is important!  A circle cannot have a negative radius.  The best practice here is to explicitly handle this invalid input, either by returning a special value (like `Double.NaN`) or, as demonstrated, by throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`. This makes the code more robust.  I've added the exception handling in the test cases, expecting the exceptions.

* **Double Comparisons:**  When comparing floating-point numbers (like `double`), you should never use `assertEquals` directly.  Floating-point calculations have inherent imprecision.  The `assertEquals` method for doubles takes a third argument � a `delta`. This `delta` specifies the tolerance within which the two doubles are considered equal.

* **Clearer Output:** The `main` method now has more descriptive output.

* **Exception Handling (Recommended):** The best practice is to add exception handling directly in the `calculateArea` and `calculatePerimeter` methods. This prevents unexpected behavior in your main application if someone tries to use a negative radius:
