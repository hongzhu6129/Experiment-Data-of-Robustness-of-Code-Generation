Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:** The code explicitly handles empty arrays and `null` input, preventing potential `NullPointerExceptions`.
* **Clearer variable names:**  `uniqueIndex` instead of just `i` or `j` makes the code's purpose more obvious.
* **Concise logic:** The core logic remains efficient and easy to understand.
* **Informative `main` method:**  Demonstrates usage with multiple examples, including edge cases, and prints the resulting array up to the new length.
* **Javadoc documentation:** Provides clear explanation of the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.  This is standard practice for professional Java code.


This improved version is more robust, readable, and maintainable.  It adheres to best practices and demonstrates the functionality effectively.
