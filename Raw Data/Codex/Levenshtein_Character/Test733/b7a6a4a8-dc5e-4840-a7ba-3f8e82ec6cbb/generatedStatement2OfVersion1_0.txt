Key improvements and explanations:

* **Error Handling:** The code now checks for invalid input (negative `n` or `k`) and provides a clear error message.
* **Efficiency:** The `binomial_Coefficient` method includes an optimization: `if (k > n / 2) { k = n - k; }`. This utilizes the property that C(n, k) = C(n, n-k) to reduce the number of iterations in the loop, making the calculation more efficient, especially for large values.
* **Overflow Prevention:** The calculation within the loop is carefully structured as `result = result * (n - i + 1) / i;` to minimize the risk of integer overflow.  By performing the multiplication first and then the division, we avoid intermediate values that could exceed the `long` data type's capacity.
* **Clearer Prompts and Output:**  The `main` method uses more descriptive prompts and output messages to improve user interaction.
* **Resource Management:**  The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` after it's no longer needed, which is good practice for resource management.


This improved version addresses potential issues, provides better error handling, and enhances overall efficiency and clarity.
