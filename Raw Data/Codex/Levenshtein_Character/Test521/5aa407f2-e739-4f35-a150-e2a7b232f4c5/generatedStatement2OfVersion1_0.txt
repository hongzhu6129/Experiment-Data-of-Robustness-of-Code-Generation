To compile and run this code:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `GetCharacterAtIndex.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac GetCharacterAtIndex.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled program, providing the string and index as command-line arguments:  `java GetCharacterAtIndex "Hello, world!" 7`  (This will get the character at index 7).


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes checks to handle invalid input:
    * It verifies that exactly two command-line arguments are provided.
    * It uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the index argument is not a valid integer.
    * It checks for index out of bounds errors.
* **Unicode Support:**  The `codePointAt()` method is used to correctly handle Unicode characters (especially supplementary characters that require two code units).  The code prints both the character itself and its Unicode code point.
* **Clearer Output:**  The output message is more informative, indicating the index and both the character and its code point.
* **User-Friendly Usage Message:** If the user provides incorrect command-line arguments, a helpful usage message is displayed.
