Key improvements:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is well-commented and clearly explains what each part does.  Variables are named descriptively (e.g., `currentYear`, `minMonth`).
* **Correctness:** The minimum values are now accurately represented. Months are handled correctly (0-indexed in `Calendar`, but displayed as 1-indexed for user-friendliness).
* **Conciseness:** Unnecessary code or complexity has been removed.
* **Output Formatting:** The output is formatted to be more readable and informative, separating current values from minimum values.


This revised solution directly addresses the prompt's requirements within the constraints of using only the `main` method.
