Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Organization:** The code is better structured with comments and separate sections for current and specific month information.
* **`YearMonth` for Day Calculation:** The `YearMonth` class is now used to correctly determine the number of days in a month, accounting for leap years.
* **String Parsing Example:**  Added an example showing how to parse a month/year string (e.g., "October 2023") into a `YearMonth` object for flexibility.
* **Error Handling (String Parsing):** While basic, the string parsing section includes a formatter to handle potential variations in month names and year formats. More robust error handling (e.g., try-catch blocks) could be added if needed.
* **Locale:**  `Locale.getDefault()` is used to ensure that the month names are displayed correctly based on the user's locale settings.



This improved version provides a more complete and user-friendly way to get month information in a Java program.
