Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Used more descriptive names like `target` instead of `x`.
2. **Binary Search Helper Function:**  Separated the binary search logic into a private `binarySearch` method. This makes the code more organized and readable. The  `binarySearch` method is a standard iterative implementation.
3. **Edge Case Handling:** Added a check at the beginning of `exponentialSearch` to handle the case where the target element is the first element of the array. This avoids unnecessary computations.
4. **Preventing Overflow:**  In `binarySearch`, calculate `mid` as `low + (high - low) / 2` to prevent potential integer overflow that could occur with `(low + high) / 2`.
5. **Range Calculation in Binary Search:** The `Math.min(i, n - 1)` ensures that the high index for the binary search does not go beyond the bounds of the array. This is crucial when `i` (the bound found by the exponential part) exceeds the array size.
6. **Comments and Documentation:** Added comments to explain the logic of both `exponentialSearch` and `binarySearch`, enhancing readability.
7. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use `exponentialSearch` with both a target element that is present and one that is not present in the array, providing a clear illustration of its functionality.


This improved version addresses potential errors, enhances readability, and follows best practices for Java coding.
