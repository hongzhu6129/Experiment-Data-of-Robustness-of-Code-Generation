Key improvements:

* **Clearer variable names:**  `uniqueIndex` instead of just `i` for tracking the position of the last unique element.
* **Handles edge cases:**  Empty array and single-element array cases are now included in the `main` method and handled correctly in `removeDuplicates`.
* **Comprehensive testing in `main`:** More test cases are added to demonstrate different scenarios.
* **Output formatting:** The output in `main` is improved to clearly show both the length and the modified array (up to the new length).
* **Comments and Javadoc:**  Comments and Javadoc explain the logic and purpose of the code.
* **Efficiency:** The code uses a single loop, making it O(n) time complexity, which is as efficient as possible for this problem. O(1) space complexity is maintained, fulfilling the in-place requirement.
