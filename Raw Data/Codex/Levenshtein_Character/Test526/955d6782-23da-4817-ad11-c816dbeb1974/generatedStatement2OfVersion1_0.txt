**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` input, returning 0 in both cases.

2. **In-Place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` function modifies the original array `nums` directly, as requested.

3. **Clearer Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` replaces `j` for better readability, indicating its purpose.

4. **Concise Return:** The length is calculated and returned directly as `uniqueIndex + 1`.

5. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** The `main` method includes multiple test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior with various inputs, including duplicates, empty arrays, and `null` input, as well as an already unique array.

6. **Outputting the Modified Array:** The `main` method uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` and `Arrays.toString` to print the *modified* array up to the new length, providing a clearer visualization of the result.  This is important because the original array *is* modified, but elements after `uniqueIndex` are not relevant to the solution.  We only want to print the relevant part of the array.


This improved version addresses the original prompt's requirements, handles edge cases, improves readability, and provides more informative output for testing.  It's also more efficient because it only iterates through the array once.
