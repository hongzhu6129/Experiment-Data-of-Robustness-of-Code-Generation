3.1 (Algebra: solve quadratic equations) The two roots of a quadratic equation can be obtained. If it is positive, theequation has two real roots. If it is zero, the equation has one root. If it is negative,the equation has no real roots.Write a program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displaysthe result based on the discriminant. If the discriminant is positive, display tworoots. If the discriminant is 0, display one root. Otherwise, display The equationhas no real roots.
