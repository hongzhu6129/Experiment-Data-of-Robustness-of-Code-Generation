Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Comments:**  Added detailed Javadoc-style comments to `removeDuplicates` explaining the purpose, parameters, return value, and providing an example.  Added inline comments in `main` for test cases.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Included several test cases in `main`:
    * An example with multiple duplicates (the original example).
    * A simpler case with fewer elements.
    * An empty array.
    * An array with a single element.  These cover important edge cases.
* **Output Formatting:**  The output now clearly shows the value of `k` and the first `k` elements of the modified array using `Arrays.copyOfRange` and `Arrays.toString` for easy visualization.
* **Error Handling:**  Included a check at the beginning of `removeDuplicates` to handle `null` or empty input arrays gracefully.
* **Efficiency:**  The algorithm itself is already efficient (O(n) time, O(1) space), so no algorithmic changes were necessary.


This revised code provides a much better educational example, demonstrating good coding practices and clearly illustrating how to solve the problem. It also makes the output much more informative and easier to understand.
