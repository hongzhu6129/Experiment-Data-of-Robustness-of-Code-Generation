Key Improvements and Explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The `deleteNode` method now checks for `null` and the last node.  It's important to handle these scenarios.  The comment explains that deleting the last node isn't possible with this specific `deleteNode` signature (because we don't have access to the previous node). The calling code has been modified to handle the edge case for the last node deletion.  Similar modifications have been made for deleting the first node.
2. **Clearer Comments:** Added more comments to explain the logic, especially in `deleteNode` and the example usage in `main`.
3. **More Test Cases:**  Included additional test cases in `main` to demonstrate deleting the last node (and explaining the limitations) and deleting the first node.  This highlights how the edge cases must be dealt with outside of `deleteNode`.
4. **No Changes to Method Signatures:**  The solution adheres strictly to the requested method signatures.


How to use `deleteNode()`:

The `deleteNode()` function is designed to be called with the node you want to delete as the argument. It's crucial to understand this function *cannot* delete the last node of the list, as explained in the comments and shown in the example usages in `main()`.
