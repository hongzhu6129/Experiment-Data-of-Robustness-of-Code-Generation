This revised code provides a more complete example, demonstrates two common concatenation methods, and shows how to handle command-line arguments if desired. It also includes clear output messages to indicate which method is being used.  If you run the program without command-line arguments, it uses the default "Hello" and " World!" strings. If you provide two command-line arguments, it concatenates those instead.


**To compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StringConcatenation.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac StringConcatenation.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code: `java StringConcatenation`  (Or, to use command-line arguments:  `java StringConcatenation "First String" " Second String"` )
