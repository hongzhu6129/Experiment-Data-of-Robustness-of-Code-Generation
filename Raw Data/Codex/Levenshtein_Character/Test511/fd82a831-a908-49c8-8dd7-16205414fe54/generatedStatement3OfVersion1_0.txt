This structured approach to testing is much better for verifying correctness, especially as your programs become more complex.  It makes it easy to run a suite of tests automatically.  JUnit offers a rich set of assertions (`assertEquals`, `assertNotEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`, etc.) to cover various testing scenarios.
