**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering normal operations, corner cases, and error handling:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Output (Sum, Difference, Product, Quotient, Remainder) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Normal Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15, 5, 50, 2.0, 0.0 |
| 2. Normal Negative Numbers | -10 | -5 | -15, -5, 50, 2.0, 0.0 |
| 3. Positive and Negative | 10 | -5 | 5, 15, -50, -2.0, 0.0 |
| 4. Negative and Positive | -10 | 5 | -5, -15, -50, -2.0, 0.0 |
| 5. Zero as first number | 0 | 5 | 5, -5, 0, 0.0, 0.0 |
| 6. Zero as second number (Division by Zero) | 5 | 0 | 5, 5, 0, "Division by zero is not allowed.", "Modulo by zero is not allowed." |
| 7.  Large Numbers | 100000 | 5000 | 105000, 95000, 5.0E8, 20.0, 0.0 |
| 8. Decimal Numbers  | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13.0, 8.0, 26.25, 4.2, 0.5 |
| 9.  Integer and Decimal| 10 | 2.5 | 12.5, 7.5, 25.0, 4.0, 0.0 |


**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. **Manually:**  You can manually enter the test case values when prompted by the program.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  For more robust testing, especially with many test cases, use a testing framework like JUnit. Create test methods for each test case and use assertions to verify the expected output. Example (using JUnit 5):
