This approach allows you to quickly and repeatedly run your tests, ensuring your code functions correctly under various conditions.  You'll want to refactor your `ArithmeticOperations` class slightly to have separate methods for `add`, `subtract`, etc., so that JUnit can test them individually.


Remember to consider edge cases involving `Double.MAX_VALUE`, `Double.MIN_VALUE`, `Infinity`, and `NaN` when testing with floating-point numbers to avoid potential overflow, underflow, or unexpected results. Using a testing framework and automating the process significantly improves efficiency and reliability.
