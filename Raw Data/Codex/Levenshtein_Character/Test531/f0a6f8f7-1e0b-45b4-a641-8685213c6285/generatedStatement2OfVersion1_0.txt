Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Node class:** The `Node` class is defined to represent the nodes of the binary tree.  It stores the data and references to the left and right children.
* **Recursive `maxDepth()`:** The `maxDepth()` method is implemented recursively.  The base case is when the `node` is `null` (empty subtree), in which case the depth is 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the depth of the left and right subtrees and returns the maximum of those depths plus 1 (for the current node).
* **Comprehensive `main()` method:**  The `main()` method creates sample binary trees (including an empty tree and a skewed tree) to demonstrate the functionality. It prints the calculated maximum depth for each tree.
* **Comments:**  Comments are added to explain the logic and purpose of the code.
* **Correctness for edge cases:** Handles the case of an empty tree (null root) correctly.



This revised code provides a more robust and understandable solution for finding the maximum depth of a binary tree in Java.
