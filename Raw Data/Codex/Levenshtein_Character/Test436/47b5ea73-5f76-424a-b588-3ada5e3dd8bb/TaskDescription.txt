Write a Java program to check whether a number is an automorphic number or not. In mathematics, an automorphic number is a number whose square "ends" in the same digits as the number itself. For example, 5 = 25, 6 = 36, 76 = 5776, and 890625 = 793212890625, so 5, 6, 76 and 890625 are all automorphic numbers.Input a number : 76                                                   
Automorphic Number.
