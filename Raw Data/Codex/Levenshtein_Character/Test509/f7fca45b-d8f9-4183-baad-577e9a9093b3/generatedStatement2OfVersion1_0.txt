**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and null arrays, returning 0 as the updated length.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueCount` is used instead of just `count` to explicitly represent the count of unique elements.

3. **In-Place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` function modifies the input array `nums` in place to store the unique elements at the beginning.  The original problem statement implies in-place modification and returning the *length* of the unique part, not a new array.

4. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** The `main` method includes test cases with different scenarios (duplicates, no duplicates, empty array, null array) to demonstrate the function's correctness.

5. **Output Clarity:**  The output in `main` uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to only print the relevant part of the array (the unique elements).  This prevents displaying leftover elements from the original array after the duplicates are "removed" (overwritten). This makes the output easier to interpret and avoids confusion.


This improved version addresses potential issues, handles various scenarios correctly, and makes the code more robust and easier to understand.
