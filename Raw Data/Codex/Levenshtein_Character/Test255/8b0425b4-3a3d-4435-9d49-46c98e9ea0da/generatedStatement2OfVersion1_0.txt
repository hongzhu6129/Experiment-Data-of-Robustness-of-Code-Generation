Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Use `m` and `n` for dimensions,  `target` for the value being searched. Makes the code easier to understand.
2. **Returns an `int[]`:**  The `Saddleback` method now returns an `int[]` of size 2.  The array holds the row and column index of the target if found.  If not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`. This is a standard way to indicate a failed search.
3. **Handles Not Found:**  The `main` method now correctly checks the return value of `Saddleback` and prints an appropriate message if the target is not found.
4. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic and the purpose of the return value.
5. **Example with Target Not Found:** Added a second example in `main` to demonstrate the behavior when the target is not present in the array.
6. **Efficient Saddleback Search:**  The `Saddleback` function correctly implements the saddleback search algorithm, efficiently using the sorted nature of the rows and columns. It starts at the top right corner and moves down or left based on the comparison with the target.


This revised code is more robust, readable, and demonstrates good coding practices. It addresses all the requirements of the problem statement and uses the specified method signatures.
