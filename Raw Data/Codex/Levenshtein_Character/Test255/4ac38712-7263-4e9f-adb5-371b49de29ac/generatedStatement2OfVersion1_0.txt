Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Variable Names:** `m` and `n` are more descriptive than just `rows` and `cols`.
* **Return an Array:**  The `Saddleback` function now returns an `int[]` containing the row and column index. This makes it easy to handle the case where the element is not found.  A `{-1, -1}` return signifies not found.
* **Concise Conditional:** The conditional logic inside the `while` loop is streamlined.
* **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function and interprets the returned array. I added an example searching for a value that isn't present to demonstrate the "not found" functionality.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the core logic.



This revised code is more efficient, readable, and robust in handling cases where the target element might not be present in the 2D array.
