**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Saddleback Search Algorithm:** The `Saddleback` (or Saddleback Search) method efficiently searches a sorted 2D array.  It starts from the top-right corner.
   - If the current element is equal to the target, the position is returned.
   - If the current element is smaller than the target, move down to the next row (because values increase as you go down).
   - If the current element is larger than the target, move left to the previous column (because values decrease as you go left).

2. **Clearer Return Value:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` where the first element is the row index and the second is the column index.  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}` to indicate failure. This is clearer than just printing inside the function.

3. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to create a sample 2D array, call `Saddleback`, and handle the returned result to print the location (or indicate if the element is not present).

4. **Error Handling:** The code now gracefully handles the case where the target element is not found.


**Example Usage and Output:**


If `target = 5`, the output will be:
