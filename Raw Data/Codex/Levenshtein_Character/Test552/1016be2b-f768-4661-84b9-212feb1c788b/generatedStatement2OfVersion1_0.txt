Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Character Counting Array:** Uses an `int[] count` of size 256 to efficiently handle ASCII characters.  This avoids sorting or repeated iterations through the string to find smaller characters.

2. **Cumulative Counts:** Calculates cumulative counts in the `count` array. This allows for fast lookup of the number of smaller characters.

3. **Factorial Calculation:** The `makefactorial` method efficiently calculates factorials.

4. **Clearer Logic:** The logic within `calcuLexicoRank` is streamlined and follows the standard algorithm for lexicographic rank calculation more closely.

5. **Example Usage:** The `main` method includes a couple of examples to demonstrate the functionality.

6. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the code's logic.


This improved version is more efficient, easier to understand, and handles character counting in a more robust way than the initial version, especially for a larger character set.
