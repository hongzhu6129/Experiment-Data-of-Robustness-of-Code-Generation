Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles duplicates correctly:** The `count` array is now used to keep track of smaller characters seen so far. This ensures the rank calculation accounts for repeated characters properly.
* **Clearer variable names:** `makefactorial` is a more descriptive name than `fact`.
* **ASCII Assumption Clarified:** A comment clarifies the assumption that the input string contains ASCII characters. This is important for understanding the size of the `count` array.
* **More Test Cases:** Several test cases are added in `main` to demonstrate the code's handling of different input strings, including those with repeated characters.
* **Efficiency:** The factorial calculation is only done when necessary, not pre-calculated for all possible values, potentially saving time and memory for larger strings (though the difference is negligible for strings of the lengths used in typical examples).
* **Error Handling (Minor):** While not strictly requested, consider adding a check in `calcuLexicoRank` to handle empty strings or null inputs gracefully.  You could return a special value like -1 or throw an exception.


This revised code provides a more robust and understandable solution to the lexicographic rank problem.
