Key improvements in this version:

- **Clarity and Readability:** Improved comments and variable names make the code easier to understand.
- **Correctness:** The merging logic is now accurate, handling various overlapping scenarios.
- **Adherence to Constraints:** The code strictly uses only the specified method signatures.
- **Example Usage:**  The `main` method provides a clear example of how to use the `merge` function.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Encapsulating the interval data within the `Interval` class makes the code more organized and robust.
- **`toString()` Override:** Added a `toString()` method to the `Interval` class to facilitate cleaner output.
