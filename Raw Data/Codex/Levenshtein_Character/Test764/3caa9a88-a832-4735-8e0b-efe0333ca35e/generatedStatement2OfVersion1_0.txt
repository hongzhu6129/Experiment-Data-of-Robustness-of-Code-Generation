Key improvements in this version:

- **Clarity and Readability:** The code is now better formatted and easier to understand. Variable names are more descriptive (e.g., `currentInterval`, `nextInterval`).
- **Correctness:** The merging logic is now accurate, handling edge cases correctly.  The last interval is correctly added to the result.
- **Comparator:** Uses an anonymous inner class for the `Comparator` to sort the intervals based on their start times. This makes the sorting logic more concise and readable within the `merge` function.
- **Object-Oriented:** Encapsulates interval data within the `Interval` class, improving structure and maintainability.
- **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `merge` function with sample data.
- **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the key steps in the code.



This revised code provides a complete and functional solution to the merging intervals problem while adhering to the given method signature constraints.
