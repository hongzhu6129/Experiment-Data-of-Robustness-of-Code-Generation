Key improvements in this code:

* **Error Handling for Image Saving:**  Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` during image saving.  This makes the code more robust.
* **Clearer Output:**  Prints a message to the console to confirm that the image has been saved and indicates the file name.
* **Dynamic Text Positioning:** Calculates the text position using `FontMetrics` to center it properly on the image, regardless of the length of the division string.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the purpose of different sections of code.
* **Uses `Graphics2D`:** `Graphics2D` provides more advanced drawing capabilities.



To run this code:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DivideAndPrintImage.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac DivideAndPrintImage.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java DivideAndPrintImage`

This will generate an image file named `division_result.png` in the same directory, displaying the division and its result.
