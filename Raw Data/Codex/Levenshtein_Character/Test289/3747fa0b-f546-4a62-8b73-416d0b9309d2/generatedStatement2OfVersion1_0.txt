Key improvements and explanations:

* **Charset Handling:** The code now explicitly demonstrates using `getBytes()` with a specified charset (UTF-8) and explains the importance of charsets.  It also shows a common pitfall with using `getBytes()` without specifying a charset (it uses the platform's default, which can lead to portability issues).
* **Encoding Demonstration:** The added Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) example with special characters clearly illustrates the consequences of encoding and decoding with mismatched charsets. This is crucial for understanding how characters are represented as bytes.
* **Error Handling:** Includes `try-catch` blocks to handle `UnsupportedEncodingException`, although UTF-8 and Latin-1 are very widely supported.
* **Helper Function:** The `printByteArray` function makes it much easier to understand the byte array contents, both in decimal and hexadecimal representation. Hex is especially useful for seeing non-printable characters.
* **Comments:**  Clearer and more comprehensive comments explain the purpose of each part of the code.
* **Clarity and Structure:** The code is formatted and organized more clearly, making it easier to follow and learn from.
