Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Explanation of Shallow vs. Deep Copy:** The code now explicitly demonstrates the difference between a shallow copy (using `putAll()`) and a deep copy, highlighting the implications when values are mutable objects.
2. **Example with Mutable Values:**  The example using `StringBuilder` illustrates how a shallow copy can lead to unexpected behavior if the values in the TreeMap are mutable objects.
3. **Deep Copy Implementation:** The code includes a deep copy implementation using a loop to create independent copies of the values.  This addresses the issue of shared mutable objects.
4. **More Comprehensive Comments:** The comments have been improved to provide a better understanding of each step in the process.
5. **Output for Clarity:** `println` statements are used to clearly show the contents of the TreeMaps at different stages, making it easier to observe the effects of shallow and deep copying.


This improved code addresses the complexities of copying TreeMaps with different types of values and provides a practical understanding of shallow vs. deep copying in Java.
