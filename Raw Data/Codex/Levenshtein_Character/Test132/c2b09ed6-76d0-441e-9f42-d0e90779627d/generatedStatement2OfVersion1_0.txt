Key improvements:

* **BigInteger:** Uses `BigInteger` for calculations to handle potentially large numbers generated during the 196-algorithm.
* **rev() function:** Implements a `rev()` function to efficiently reverse a `BigInteger`.
* **lychrel() function:**  Handles the Lychrel check logic and returns a `Tuple` containing:
    * A boolean indicating if the number is a Lychrel candidate.
    * The number of iterations performed.
* **Clear output:** Prints the Lychrel candidates and the total count.
* **Iteration Limit:** Respects the 500-iteration limit.
* **Tuple:**  Includes a basic Tuple class for returning multiple values from `lychrel()` (you can use a library like Apache Commons Lang's `Triple` or JavaFX's `Pair` if available).
* **Efficiency:** Uses `StringBuilder` for string reversal which is much more efficient than string concatenation in a loop.


This revised version is more robust, handles large numbers correctly, and provides clearer output.
