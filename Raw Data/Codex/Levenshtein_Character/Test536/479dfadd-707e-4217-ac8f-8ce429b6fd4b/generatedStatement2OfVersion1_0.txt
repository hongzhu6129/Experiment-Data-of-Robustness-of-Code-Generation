Explanation:

1. **`removeDuplicates(int[] nums)`:**
   - Handles edge cases: empty or null array.
   - Uses `uniqueIndex` to track the position to place the next unique element.
   - Iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is different from the element at `uniqueIndex`, it means we've found a new unique element. We increment `uniqueIndex` and copy the current element to the `uniqueIndex` position.
   - Finally, returns `uniqueIndex + 1` which is the new length of the array (number of unique elements).

2. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - Provides test cases to demonstrate the functionality.
   - `Arrays.copyOf(nums, len)` is used to print only the relevant part of the array after removing duplicates, as the original array's size remains unchanged, but elements beyond `len` are no longer relevant.
