**Explanation:**

1. **`removeElement(int[] nums, int val)`:**
   - Initializes `k` to 0. `k` will track the index of the next position to place a non-`val` element.
   - Iterates through the input array `nums`.
   - If the current element `nums[i]` is *not* equal to `val`, it copies that element to the `k`th position.  Then it increments `k`. This effectively overwrites any occurrences of `val` with the elements that should be kept.
   - Returns the final value of `k`, which is the new length of the array (containing only elements not equal to `val`).

2. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - Creates a sample array `nums` and sets the value to remove (`val`).
   - Prints the original array.
   - Calls `removeElement` to modify the array and get the new length.
   - Prints the new length.
   - Prints the modified array (up to the `newLength`).  The elements after `newLength` are still in the array, but they are no longer considered part of the "new" array after the removal operation.


**Key Idea:** The algorithm doesn't actually delete elements from the array (Java arrays have a fixed size). It moves the desired elements to the beginning of the array and then returns the new effective length. This is an efficient in-place modification.
