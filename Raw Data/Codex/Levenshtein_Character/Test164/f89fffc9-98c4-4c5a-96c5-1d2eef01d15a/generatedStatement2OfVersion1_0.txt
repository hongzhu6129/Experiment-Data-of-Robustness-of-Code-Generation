To compile and run:

1.  **Save:** Save the code as `CompareFilesLexicographically.java`.
2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it: `javac CompareFilesLexicographically.java`
3.  **Run:** Execute the program, providing the paths to the two files as arguments:  `java CompareFilesLexicographically file1.txt file2.txt` (Replace `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` with the actual file names and paths.)


**Explanation and Improvements:**

*   **Handles File Length Differences:** The code now correctly handles cases where one file is shorter than the other.
*   **Line-by-Line Comparison:** It compares the files line by line.  If a difference is found on a line, the comparison stops.
*   **`compareTo()`:** Uses the efficient `String.compareTo()` method for lexicographical string comparison.
*   **Try-with-resources:** Uses try-with-resources to ensure that the files are closed properly, even if exceptions occur.
*   **Clearer Output:**  Provides more informative output messages.
*   **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling for `IOException`.
*   **Usage Instructions:**  Prints usage instructions if the incorrect number of arguments is provided.


This improved version addresses the potential issues and provides a more robust solution for lexicographically comparing two files.
