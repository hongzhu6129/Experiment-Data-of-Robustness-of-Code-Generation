**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`count_nums_not_7(int n)`:**
   - This method iterates from 1 to `n`.
   - For each number, it calls `containsDigit7()` to check if the number contains the digit 7.
   - If `containsDigit7()` returns `false` (meaning the number does *not* contain 7), the `count` is incremented.

2. **`containsDigit7(int num)`:**
   - This helper method efficiently checks for the presence of the digit 7.
   - It uses a `while` loop and the modulo operator (`%`) to extract the last digit of the number repeatedly.  If the last digit is 7, it immediately returns `true`.
   - If the loop completes without finding a 7, it returns `false`.

3. **`main` method:**
   - Provides example test cases to demonstrate how to use the `count_nums_not_7` method.




This improved version is more concise, efficient, and easier to understand.  It avoids unnecessary string conversions and directly works with integer arithmetic, making it a better approach for this type of problem.
