Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Names and Comments:** Added Javadoc-style comments to explain the purpose of each method and parameter. Method names are more descriptive.
2. **Helper Function:** Introduced a `containsDigit7` helper function to improve code readability and organization.  This makes the main `count_nums_not_7` logic cleaner.
3. **Efficient Digit Checking:** The `containsDigit7` method efficiently checks for the digit 7 by repeatedly taking the modulo (%) and dividing by 10.  This is a standard and efficient way to process digits in an integer.
4. **Test Cases in `main`:** Included test cases in the `main` method to demonstrate the functionality and help verify correctness.  It's very important to test your code with different inputs.
5. **Correct Logic:** The logic is now correct, addressing the issue in the previous version where numbers 70-79 weren't handled quite correctly.




This improved version is more efficient, readable, and easier to understand and maintain.  It incorporates best practices for Java coding.
