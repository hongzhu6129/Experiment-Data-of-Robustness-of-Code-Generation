**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles `null` and empty arrays.  This is important for robustness.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueIndex` is a more descriptive name than just `j` or `k`.  Good variable names improve readability.

3. **Efficient In-Place Modification:** The code directly modifies the input array `nums` to store the unique elements at the beginning. It does not create any new arrays, making it memory-efficient.

4. **Returns the Correct Length:**  It returns `uniqueIndex + 1` because `uniqueIndex` is the *index* of the last unique element, and the length is always one greater than the index.

5. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** The `main` method includes multiple test cases, including empty and null arrays, to demonstrate how the function handles different scenarios.

6. **Output Clarity:** The output in the `main` method now clearly shows both the updated length and the modified array (up to the new length), making it easier to understand the results. Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to only print the relevant portion of the modified array (avoids printing the "garbage" values after the unique elements).
