Explanation of the error and solution:

The error "invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'sort,'" occurs when you try to convert a string that isn't a valid integer (in base 10) into an integer using `Integer.parseInt()`.  In the original prompt, the example seemed to be trying to sort an array containing the string "sort," which obviously can't be converted to an integer.

The provided code addresses this in two ways:

1. **Correct Example:** It shows how to create and sort a proper integer array (`arr1`) to demonstrate the correct usage of `bubbleSort`.

2. **Error Handling:** It demonstrates how an array containing non-numeric strings (like `strArr`) could cause the error. The code then includes a `try-catch` block to handle the `NumberFormatException`. Inside the `try` block, `Integer.parseInt()` attempts the conversion. If the conversion fails, the `catch` block handles the error gracefully (in this example by printing an error message and assigning a default value of -1).  This prevents the program from crashing and demonstrates a way to deal with potentially bad input.  You could adapt the error handling to your specific needs (e.g., skip the invalid element, prompt the user for correct input, etc.).
