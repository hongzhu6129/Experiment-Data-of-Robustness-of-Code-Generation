Key improvements and explanations:

* **`java.time` API:** Uses the modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8) for date and time handling. This is preferred over the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes.
* **Clearer examples:** Provides more examples of common holidays, including those that require calculations like "first Monday of September".
* **`TemporalAdjusters`:** Uses `TemporalAdjusters` for easily finding specific days of the week within a month (e.g., first Monday, last Thursday).
* **`LocalDateTime`:**  Uses `LocalDateTime` to store both date and time information, although the time is set to the beginning of the day (midnight) using `atStartOfDay()`.
* **`displayHolidayInfo` method:**  Creates a separate method to avoid code duplication and make the main method cleaner.
* **Comments:**  Includes comments to explain the purpose of different parts of the code.
* **Formatted Output:** Uses `println()` for better readability of the output.
* **Handles Variable Dates:**  Correctly calculates dates for holidays that don't fall on a fixed day of the month, like Labor Day and Thanksgiving.




This improved version provides a more complete and robust solution for displaying information about default holidays in Java.
