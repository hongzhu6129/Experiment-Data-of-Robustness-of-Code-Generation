**Explanation and Example:**

1. **`main` method:**
   - Takes the input string (e.g., "abc").
   - Calls `permutationWithRepeation` to start the process.

2. **`permutationWithRepeation` method:**
   - Initializes the process by calling `showPermutation` with the input string and an empty prefix.

3. **`showPermutation` method (Recursive):**
   - **Base Case:** If the length of the `prefix` equals the length of the original string, it means a full permutation has been formed. Print the `prefix` and return.
   - **Recursive Step:** 
     - Iterates through each character of the input string (`str`).
     - For each character, it recursively calls `showPermutation` again, but this time with an extended `prefix` (the current `prefix` plus the character at index `i`).  This effectively builds up the permutations by adding one character at a time, and exploring all possible combinations at each level of the recursion.

**Example with "abc" as input:**

- The initial call is `showPermutation("abc", "")`.
- The loop in `showPermutation` adds 'a', 'b', or 'c' to the prefix:
  - `showPermutation("abc", "a")`
  - `showPermutation("abc", "b")`
  - `showPermutation("abc", "c")`
- Inside `showPermutation("abc", "a")`, it again adds 'a', 'b', or 'c':
  - `showPermutation("abc", "aa")`
  - `showPermutation("abc", "ab")`
  - `showPermutation("abc", "ac")`
- This continues until the prefix has a length of 3 (the length of "abc"), at which point the permutation is printed.


This recursive approach explores all possible combinations of characters, including repetitions, generating the full set of permutations with repetition.
