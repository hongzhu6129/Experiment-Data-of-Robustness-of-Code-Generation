**Explanation and Example Output:**

1. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - This method starts the program.  It calls `permutationWithRepeation` with the input string "ab".

2. **`permutationWithRepeation(String input)`:**
   - This method initiates the recursive process by calling `showPermutation` with the input string and an initially empty `currentPermutation`.

3. **`showPermutation(String input, String currentPermutation)`:**
   - This is the recursive method that generates the permutations.
   - **Base Case:**  If the `currentPermutation` has reached the length of the `input` string, it means a full permutation has been formed.  It prints the permutation and returns.
   - **Recursive Step:** It iterates through each character of the `input` string. For each character, it adds it to the `currentPermutation` and makes a recursive call to `showPermutation` with the updated `currentPermutation`.  This explores all possible combinations.

**For the input "ab", the output will be:**
