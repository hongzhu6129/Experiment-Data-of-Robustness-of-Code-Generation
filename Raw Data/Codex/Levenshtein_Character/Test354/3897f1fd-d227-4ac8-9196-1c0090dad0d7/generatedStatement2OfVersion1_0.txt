Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `i` or `j`.
2. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code now explicitly checks for `null` or empty input arrays.
3. **In-Place Modification:**  The array is modified directly as required.
4. **Concise Logic:**  The core logic for removing duplicates is streamlined.
5. **Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method provides multiple test cases, including edge cases (empty and null array) to demonstrate the correctness of the `removeDuplicates` function. 
6. **Output Clarity:** The `main` method now uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`  to print only the relevant part of the modified array (up to the new length). This avoids printing the "garbage" values that might remain after the new length.


This revised version addresses the prompt's requirements effectively and demonstrates good coding practices.
