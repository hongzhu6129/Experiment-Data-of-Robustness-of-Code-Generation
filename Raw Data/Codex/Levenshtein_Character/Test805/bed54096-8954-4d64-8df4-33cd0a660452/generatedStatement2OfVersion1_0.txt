**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Use of `double`:**  The calculations are performed using `double` to handle floating-point numbers and ensure accuracy.  Using `int` for the fractions would result in integer division, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Explicit Decimal Points:**  Numbers like `1.0`, `3.0`, etc., are used to ensure floating-point division. For example, `1/3` would perform integer division, resulting in `0`.  `1.0/3.0` correctly yields `0.333...`.

3. **Correct Alternating Signs:** The signs alternate correctly in the series: +, -, +, -, +, -,...

4. **Clear Output:** The output clearly labels each approximation with the number of terms used.

5. **Efficiency (for longer series):** While this code directly calculates the sum for 5 and 6 terms, for a significantly larger number of terms, a loop would be more efficient. Here's how you would do it with a loop (more generalizable):
