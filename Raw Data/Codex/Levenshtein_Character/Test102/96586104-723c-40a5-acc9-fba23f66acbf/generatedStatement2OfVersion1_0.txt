Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Empty Array:**  Added a check at the beginning of `removeDuplicates` to correctly handle the case of an empty input array.
2. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Used `uniqueCount` instead of just `j` for better readability.
3. **In-Place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` method modifies the original array `nums` directly as requested, and then returns the length of the updated subarray with unique elements.
4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method now includes multiple test cases, including an empty array and an array with no duplicates, to demonstrate the robustness of the code.
5. **Output Formatting:**  The output is now formatted to clearly show the updated length and the modified array contents using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to prevent printing the unchanged portions of the original array. This is important because although the original array is modified in place, elements beyond the `uniqueCount` index are not relevant to the solution.




This improved version addresses the potential edge case of an empty array, enhances clarity, and provides more thorough testing. It adheres to the specified method signatures while offering a robust and understandable solution.
