Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles Edge Cases:** Now correctly handles empty arrays and cases where `k` is larger than the array size.  It provides informative output or adjusts gracefully depending on the situation.
- **Clearer Output:** Adds a newline at the end of the output for better readability.
- **More Comprehensive Examples:** Demonstrates usage with a wider range of input arrays, including negative numbers, duplicates, and edge cases, making the example more robust.
- **Efficiency:** Uses a `PriorityQueue` (min-heap) which is the most efficient way to find the k largest elements, especially for large arrays. Its time complexity is O(n log k).
- **Correctness:**  Ensures the k largest elements are printed in descending order by sorting the results extracted from the priority queue.


This revised response is more robust, efficient, and clearly demonstrates how to solve the problem with appropriate error handling and example usage.
