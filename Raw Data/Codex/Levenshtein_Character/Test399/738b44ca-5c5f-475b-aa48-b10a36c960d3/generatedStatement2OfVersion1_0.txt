Key improvements in this version:

1. **Handles Leading Zeros:** The `split_num` function now correctly handles leading zeros in the second part of the split number, ensuring accurate calculations.
2. **Clearer Output:** The output format is improved with better spacing and labeling.
3. **Correct Single-Digit Kaprekars:** The code correctly identifies single-digit Kaprekar numbers (1 and 9).
4. **Handles Zero in Second Part:** The improved leading zero handling ensures that numbers where the second part of the square is zero are handled correctly (like the case for 99 where the square is 9801).
5. **Handles Edge Cases Robustly:**  The logic for handling single-digit numbers and ensuring that both parts of the split are non-zero (except for single-digit cases) is now more robust.  This prevents false positives (like 10 being incorrectly classified as a Kaprekar number in previous versions). 


This revised version addresses all the issues and provides a complete and accurate solution to find Kaprekar numbers less than 1000.
