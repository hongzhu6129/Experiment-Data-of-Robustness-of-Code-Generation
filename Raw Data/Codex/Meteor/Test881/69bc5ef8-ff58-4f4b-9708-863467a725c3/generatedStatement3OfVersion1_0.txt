Remember to replace the `...` in the test cases with the complete expected output for each test. This JUnit example demonstrates how to capture and check the console output from your `printMultiplicationTable` method.  You would add similar `@Test` methods for the other test cases (zero, negative, large numbers, and invalid input).  Using a testing framework like JUnit provides a much more organized and automated way to ensure your code is correct and handles various scenarios.
