Key improvements:

* **Clearer and more concise code:** Using `String.replace()` makes the logic straightforward.
* **Handles edge cases:**  The code now includes handling for `null` inputs (you could also choose to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if `null` is not allowed).
* **More comprehensive testing in `main()`:**  The examples now demonstrate removing a string that appears multiple times, removing a string that doesn't exist, and handling `null` inputs.  Good testing is crucial!
* **Informative output:** The `main()` method now prints the original string and the modified string clearly, making it easier to see the results.


This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and better demonstrates how to use the `removeString()` method.
