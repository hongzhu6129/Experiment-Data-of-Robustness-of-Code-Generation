Here's how the code works given the constraints of the method signatures:

1. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - This is the entry point of the program. 
   - It initializes the `inputString` with the string you want permutations for.
   - It calls `permutationWithRepeation` to start the permutation process.

2. **`permutationWithRepeation(String inputString)`:**
   - This method initiates the recursive process.  It calls `showPermutation` with the input string and an empty string representing the current permutation being built.

3. **`showPermutation(String inputString, String currentPermutation)`:**
   - This is the recursive method that generates the permutations.
   - **Base Case:** If the `currentPermutation` reaches the length of the `inputString`, it means a full permutation has been formed, so it's printed.
   - **Recursive Step:** It iterates through the `inputString`. In each iteration, it adds a character from `inputString` to the `currentPermutation` and makes a recursive call to `showPermutation`. This explores all possible combinations with repetition.
