Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Input Validation:** The `isValidBinary()` method is added to thoroughly check if the input strings are valid binary representations (containing only '0' and '1'). This prevents unexpected behavior or exceptions.

2. **Handles Different Lengths:**  The `padWithZeros()` method now handles cases where the input binary strings have different lengths by padding the shorter string with leading zeros.  This ensures correct bitwise OR operation.

3. **Clear Error Handling:** Returns a descriptive error message if the input is invalid.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The `main()` method includes a variety of test cases covering:
   - Different lengths of binary strings
   - Cases where one or both inputs are all zeros or all ones.
   - Empty strings.
   - Invalid input (non-binary characters, null).



This improved version is more robust, handles a wider range of inputs correctly, and provides clearer error messages, making it much better for practical use.
