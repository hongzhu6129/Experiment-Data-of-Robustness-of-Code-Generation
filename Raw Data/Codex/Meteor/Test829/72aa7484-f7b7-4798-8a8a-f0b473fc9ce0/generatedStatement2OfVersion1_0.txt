Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty strings (`""`) and `null` strings without throwing exceptions.
- **Clearer logic:** The loop condition and `break` statement make the logic easier to follow.
- **More comprehensive testing:** The `main` method includes several test cases demonstrating different scenarios.
- **Efficiency:** The code starts checking from the largest possible substring length and stops as soon as a match is found. This avoids unnecessary comparisons.
- **Comments:** Added comments to explain important parts of the code.
