**Important Considerations for Handling Corner/Error Cases:**

* **Negative Radius:**  The code as provided doesn't explicitly handle negative radii.  You should add a check to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` or print an error message if the radius is negative.
* **Overflow:**  For extremely large radii (like `Double.MAX_VALUE`), the calculations might overflow. Consider checking for these conditions or using `BigDecimal` for arbitrary precision if needed.
* **Floating-point Comparisons:** Never directly compare floating-point numbers for equality using `==`.  Use a tolerance (delta) as shown in the JUnit example.



By implementing these test cases and error handling, you'll make your program much more robust and reliable.
