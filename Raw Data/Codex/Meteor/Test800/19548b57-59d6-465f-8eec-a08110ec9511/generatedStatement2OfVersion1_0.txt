**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **TreeNode Class:** Represents a node in the binary tree. It has an integer value (`val`) and pointers to its left and right children (`left`, `right`).

2. **`is_Identical_tree_node(TreeNode p, TreeNode q)`:**
   - **Base Cases:**
     - If both `p` and `q` are `null`, they are considered identical (empty trees are identical).
     - If one of them is `null` and the other isn't, they are not identical.
   - **Value Check:** If the values of `p` and `q` are different, they are not identical.
   - **Recursive Calls:** Recursively call `is_Identical_tree_node` on the left subtrees (`p.left`, `q.left`) and the right subtrees (`p.right`, `q.right`). The trees are only identical if both recursive calls return `true`.

3. **`main` Method (Example Usage):**
   - Creates example trees (`root1`, `root2`, `root3`) to demonstrate how to use the `is_Identical_tree_node` method.
   - Prints the results to the console to show whether the trees are identical.
   - Includes added test cases that show how the method handles null trees and trees with null left or right children to ensure a robust solution.


4. **Key Concepts Illustrated:**
   - **Recursion:** The function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems (comparing subtrees).
   - **Tree Traversal:** The function effectively performs a simultaneous, depth-first traversal of both trees.
   - **Base Case:**  Crucial in recursive functions to stop the recursion.


This improved version is more robust, handles edge cases correctly, provides clearer explanations, and demonstrates good coding practices.  It's better suited as an educational example.
