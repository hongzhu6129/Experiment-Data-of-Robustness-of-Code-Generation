**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Comments and Explanation:** The code includes detailed comments to explain the logic and the limitations of the `deleteNode` method, particularly regarding deleting the last node.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:** The `deleteNode` function now explicitly handles the case where the node to be deleted is `null` or the last node in the list. It prints a message instead of crashing and explains why this method is not suitable for deleting the last node. This is important from an educational perspective.

3. **More Comprehensive Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method now demonstrates multiple scenarios: deleting a middle node, deleting a node closer to the beginning and attempts to delete the last node, and clearly shows the output for each case, highlighting the limitation of this approach for the last node.

4. **ListNode Class:** The `ListNode` class is included within the code for completeness and ease of understanding.

**Why This Method Doesn't Work for the Last Node**

This method relies on copying the data from the *next* node to the current node and then updating the `next` pointer to skip the next node.  If the current node is the *last* node, there is no "next" node to copy data from, and we can't simply make `node.next = null` because that only removes the reference *from the node we're deleting*�the previous node's `next` pointer would still be pointing to the node we tried to delete.  To delete the last node correctly, you *must* have access to the second-to-last node.


**How to Delete the Last Node Correctly**

To delete the last node, you need to iterate through the list until you find the second-to-last node.  Then set the `next` pointer of the second-to-last node to `null`. This requires a slightly different approach and cannot be done with only the provided method signatures.
