Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Naming:**  `count_nums_not_7` is more descriptive than a shorter name.

2. **Helper Function:**  The `containsDigit7` helper function makes the code more readable and modular.  It isolates the logic for checking the digit 7.

3. **Comments/Javadoc:**  Added Javadoc comments to the methods explaining their purpose and parameters, which significantly improves code understanding and maintainability.

4. **Test Cases in `main`:**  Included example test cases in `main` to demonstrate how to use the `count_nums_not_7` function and to allow for quick verification of correctness.

5. **Efficiency:** The `containsDigit7` method efficiently checks for the digit 7 without needing to convert the number to a string.




This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and follows better coding practices.  The inclusion of test cases makes it more reliable and easier to debug if changes are made in the future.
