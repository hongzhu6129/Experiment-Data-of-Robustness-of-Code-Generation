This educational example demonstrates several ways to convert a `LinkedList` to an `ArrayList` and also explains why you might want to perform this conversion (faster access to elements by index using `get()`).  It includes clear comments and also shows the conversion with both String and Integer types.  The helper method `getLinkedListElement` illustrates how accessing an element at a specific index in a linked list requires traversal, unlike an array list.
