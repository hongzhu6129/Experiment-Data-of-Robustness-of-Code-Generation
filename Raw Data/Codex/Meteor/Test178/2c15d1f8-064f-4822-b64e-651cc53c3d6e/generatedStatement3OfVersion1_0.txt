This JUnit example demonstrates how to systematically test your `functionone` method with different input values and verify that the output matches the expected octal representation. This automated approach is more efficient and less error-prone than manual testing, especially as you add more features to your code.  You can run these tests within your IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse) or using build tools like Maven or Gradle.
