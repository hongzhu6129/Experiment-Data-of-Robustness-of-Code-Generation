**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Uses `java.time`:**  The modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8) is used for date/time calculations. It's much cleaner and easier to use than the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** More descriptive variable names improve readability (e.g., `twoWeeksAgo` instead of just `date`).

3. **Date Formatting:** The `DateTimeFormatter` is used to format the output date in a standard "yyyy-MM-dd" format.  You can easily change this to a different format if needed.

4. **Optional Command-Line Argument Handling:** The code now includes a section to demonstrate how you could optionally accept a date as a command-line argument.  It includes error handling (using a `try-catch` block) in case the user provides an invalid date format.

5. **`LocalDate.now()`:**  Gets the current date.

6. **`minusWeeks(2)`:** Subtracts 2 weeks from the current date.

**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `TwoWeeksPrior.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then compile it:
