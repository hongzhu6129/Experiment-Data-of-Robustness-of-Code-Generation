Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles 0 Remainder Correctly:** The code now explicitly handles the case where `n % 26` is 0 (which corresponds to 'Z'). It appends "Z", and crucially, it decrements `n` by `(n / 26) - 1` to avoid off-by-one errors.

2. **Uses StringBuilder for Efficiency:**  String concatenation using `+` repeatedly within a loop is inefficient. `StringBuilder` is much more performant, especially for larger column numbers.

3. **Reverses the String:**  The characters are appended in reverse order due to the way the modulo operation works. `StringBuilder.reverse()` efficiently corrects this.

4. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `columnName` instead of just `c` enhances readability.

5. **More Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method now includes several test cases to demonstrate the code's correctness, including edge cases like 26, 52, 701, and 702.



This revised version addresses the core logic flaw, improves efficiency, and enhances clarity and testability, making it a robust solution for the Excel column naming problem.
