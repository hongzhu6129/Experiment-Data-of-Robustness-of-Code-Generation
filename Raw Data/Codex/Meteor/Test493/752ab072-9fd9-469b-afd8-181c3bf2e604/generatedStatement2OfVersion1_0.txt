Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Regular Expressions:** Uses `java.util.regex.Pattern` and `java.util.regex.Matcher` for efficient and robust number extraction. The pattern `\\d+` matches one or more consecutive digits.

2. **Error Handling (Implicit):** `Integer.parseInt()` will throw a `NumberFormatException` if the matched substring isn't a valid integer. This is unlikely with the `\\d+` pattern but could happen if the numbers are extremely large. For more robust error handling, a `try-catch` block could be added around `Integer.parseInt()`.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** More descriptive variable names like `pattern` and `matcher` improve readability.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases in `main()`:** The `main()` method now includes a variety of test cases to demonstrate the code's handling of different input scenarios (single-digit numbers, spaces, empty strings, etc.).  This is crucial for verifying correctness.

5. **Comments:** Added comments to explain key parts of the code.


This revised version is more efficient, robust, and easier to understand and maintain.
