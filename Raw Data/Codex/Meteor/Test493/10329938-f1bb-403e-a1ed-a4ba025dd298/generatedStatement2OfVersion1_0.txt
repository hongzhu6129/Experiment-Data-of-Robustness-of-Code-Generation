Key improvements:

- **Handles spaces:** The regex now accounts for potential spaces around the comparison operators, making it more robust.
- **Handles `!=`:**  Added logic to correctly process the "not equal to" operator.
- **Clearer Variable Names:**  Used more descriptive variable names (e.g., `num1`, `num2`, `operator`) for better readability.
- **More Comprehensive Testing:** Added more test cases in `main` to cover different scenarios, including empty strings, strings without comparisons, and strings with spaces.
- **Comments:** Included comments to explain the regex and the logic.
