This provides three different ways to achieve the decimal-to-binary conversion within the `main` method:

1. **`Integer.toBinaryString()`:**  The simplest and most direct approach.

2. **Manual Conversion with String Concatenation:** Illustrates the conversion logic clearly but less efficient for larger numbers due to string concatenation.

3. **Manual Conversion with `StringBuilder`:**  More efficient for larger numbers because `StringBuilder` avoids the overhead of repeated string creation.  It is generally preferred for string manipulation within loops.
