**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Input Validation:** The code now checks if the side length is valid (positive).  This prevents calculations with invalid inputs and potential errors.
2. **Clearer Output:**  The output is formatted to be more user-friendly.
3. **Test Cases:** I've included some sample test cases directly in the `main` method. This demonstrates how you would test the code.  In real-world development, you would separate your test cases into a proper testing framework (like JUnit) for better organization and automation.
4. **Corner Cases:** The test cases cover some important corner cases:
   - A small side length (1).
   - A large side length (100).
   - Invalid input (negative and zero).
5. **Scanner Closed:** Added `scanner.close()` to release the scanner resource.


**To run these tests:**

1. Save the code as `HexagonArea.java`.
2. Compile: `javac HexagonArea.java`
3. Run: `java HexagonArea`

You'll be prompted to enter a side length, and then the program will print the calculated area followed by the outputs of the hardcoded test cases.  Compare the expected area with the calculated area to verify correctness.
