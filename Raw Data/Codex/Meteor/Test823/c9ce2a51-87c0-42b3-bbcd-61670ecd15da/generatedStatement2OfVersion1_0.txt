Key improvements and explanations in this educational example:

1. **Two Cloning Methods:** Shows both the constructor method (recommended) and the `clone()` method.
2. **Clear Output:**  Clearly labels the sets and their contents at each stage, making it easy to follow.
3. **Mutability Demonstration:** Demonstrates the crucial difference between shallow and deep copying, especially when dealing with mutable objects like `StringBuilder`.  This helps highlight the potential pitfalls of using `clone()` directly with HashSets containing mutable objects.
4. **Deep Copy Solution:** Provides a solution for deep copying HashSets with mutable objects, which is essential for true independence between the original and cloned sets.
5. **Best Practice Emphasis:** Highlights the preferred method (constructor) and explains why it's generally safer and more efficient.
6. **Detailed Comments:**  Explains each step and highlights potential issues.


This improved example provides a more comprehensive educational experience on cloning HashSets in Java.
