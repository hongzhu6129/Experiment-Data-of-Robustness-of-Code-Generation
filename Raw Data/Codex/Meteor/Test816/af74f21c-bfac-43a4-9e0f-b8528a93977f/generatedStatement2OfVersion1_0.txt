**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **TreeNode Class:**  A clear `TreeNode` class is defined to represent the nodes of the BST.

2. **Midpoint Calculation:**  The `mid` calculation in `creation` is now `int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;`. This prevents potential integer overflow that could occur with `(left + right) / 2` if `left` and `right` were very large.

3. **Clearer Recursion Base Case:** The base case `if (left > right)` in `creation` makes the recursion logic easier to follow.

4. **Pre-order Traversal:** The `traverseTree` method performs a pre-order traversal, which is a standard way to print the tree structure (root, left, right).  This matches the requested sample output format.

5. **Error Handling:**  A simple check for `null` or empty input array is added to `sortedArrayToBST` to make it more robust.

6. **Adherence to Method Signatures:** The code strictly adheres to the provided method signatures.

**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Solution.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then compile using: `javac Solution.java`
3. **Run:**  `java Solution`

This will produce output similar to (the order might vary slightly due to pre-order traversal):  `2 1 4 6 5 3`


This revised solution addresses the potential overflow issue, uses a standard traversal method, handles edge cases, and is more readable overall.  It also adheres precisely to the requested method signature requirements.
