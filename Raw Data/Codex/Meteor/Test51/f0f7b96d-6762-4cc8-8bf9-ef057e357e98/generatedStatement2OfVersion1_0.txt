Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:** Explicitly checks for `null` and empty input arrays.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `j`.
- **In-place modification:**  The code correctly modifies the original array in-place.
- **Improved main method:** Provides multiple test cases and prints the modified array correctly (only the relevant part after duplicate removal).
- **Comments explaining the logic:** Added comments to explain the purpose of the code sections.  
- **Handles null input gracefully:**  The `main` method now avoids the `NullPointerException` that could occur when trying to print the modified array if the input was `null`.
