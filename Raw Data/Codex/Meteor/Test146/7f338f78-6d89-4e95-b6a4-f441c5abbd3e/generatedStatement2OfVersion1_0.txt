This code will output an approximation of the American flag using ASCII characters. It simplifies the star field (represented by "pct")  and focuses on recreating the pattern of stripes and the blue canton.  True graphical representation in the console is very limited; this is a text-based representation.  To get a more visually accurate flag, you would need to use a graphics library like Swing or JavaFX.
