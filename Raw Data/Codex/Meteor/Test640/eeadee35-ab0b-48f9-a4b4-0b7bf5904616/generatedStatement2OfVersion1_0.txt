Key improvements:

* **`sumOfProperDivisors` helper function:**  This function cleanly calculates the sum of proper divisors, making the `isAmicable` function more readable.
* **`isAmicable` function:** This function specifically checks for amicability, separating the logic from the main method.
* **Clearer output:**  The output now clearly states whether the numbers are amicable or not.
* **Example with non-amicable numbers:** Demonstrates that the code correctly identifies non-amicable pairs.
* **Interactive user input:** The code now includes an example showing how to get input from the user using the `Scanner` class.  This allows the user to test different number pairs interactively. The try-with-resources ensures the `Scanner` is closed correctly.



This revised answer is more structured, readable, and robust, making it a better solution to the problem.
