Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Distinct Pairs:** The code now ensures that the pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct by starting `b` from `a + 1` and `d` from `c + 1`, and also adding an explicit check `(a != c && a != d && b != c && b != d)`.  This was a crucial missing piece in the previous responses.

2. **Efficiency:**  The code includes `break` statements within the loops.  If `a3`, `a3 + b3`, `c3`, or `c3 + d3` exceed `n`, there's no need to continue the inner loops.  This significantly improves efficiency, especially for larger values of `n`.

3. **Clarity:** The code is more readable with clearer variable names and comments explaining the logic.

4. **Flexibility:** The value of `n` can be easily changed.

5. **Correctness:** The logic now accurately identifies numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two *distinct* ways, addressing the original problem statement.


How to compile and run:

1. Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. Compile: `javac Ramanujan.java`
3. Run: `java Ramanujan`


This improved version will correctly find Ramanujan's number (1729) and can be used to explore larger ranges for other such numbers. If you remove the `return` statement after printing the first result, it will find all such numbers up to the given value of `n`.
