Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  More descriptive variable names like `rows` and `cols` improve readability.

2. **Helper Functions:**  `initializeDP` and `calculateMinPathSum` separate the initialization logic and the core dynamic programming logic, making the code more organized and easier to understand. 

3. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic and purpose of different sections of the code.

4. **DP Approach Explanation:**  The code now clearly uses dynamic programming.  `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum path sum to reach cell `(i, j)`. The base cases (first row and first column) are initialized, and the rest of the `dp` array is filled using the recurrence relation: `dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

5. **Efficiency:** The dynamic programming approach is efficient, with a time complexity of O(rows * cols) and a space complexity of O(rows * cols) (which can be optimized to O(cols) if you use only two rows for `dp` as you iterate).


This improved version is more structured, readable, and clearly demonstrates the dynamic programming approach to solving the min path sum problem.
