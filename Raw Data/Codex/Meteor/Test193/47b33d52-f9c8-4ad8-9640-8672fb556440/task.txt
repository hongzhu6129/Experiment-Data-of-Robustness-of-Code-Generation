Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program to check whether a number is a Harshad Number or not. In recreational mathematics, a harshad number in a given number base, is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits when written in that base. Example: Number 200 is a Harshad Number because the sum of digits 2 and 0 and 0 is 2(2+0+0) and 200 is divisible by 2. Number 171 is a Harshad Number because the sum of digits 1 and 7 and 1 is 9(1+7+1) and 171 is divisible by 9.\nInput a number : 353                                                    \n353 is not a Harshad Number.\n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n Problem Id is : 47b33d52-f9c8-4ad8-9640-8672fb556440.\n
