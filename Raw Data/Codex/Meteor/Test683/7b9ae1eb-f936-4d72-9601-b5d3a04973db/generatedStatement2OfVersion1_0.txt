Key improvements and explanations in this refined version:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `i` for tracking the position of unique elements.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes checks for `null` or empty input arrays to prevent `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

3. **In-Place Modification:** Modifies the original array `nums` directly, as requested, to remove duplicates in-place.

4. **Return Value:** Returns the correct length of the modified array (the number of unique elements).

5. **Comprehensive `main` method:** Demonstrates the function's behavior with various test cases, including empty and null inputs, and prints the modified array in a clear way using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid showing the unchanged trailing elements.

6. **Concise and Efficient:**  The core logic is streamlined and avoids unnecessary complexity.



This revised solution addresses the prompt's requirements precisely and robustly.
