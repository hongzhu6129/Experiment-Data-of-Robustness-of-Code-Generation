**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Recursion:**  The core of the solution is recursion.  The `multiply_two_nums` method calls itself with a smaller value of `b` in each step.  This effectively simulates repeated addition.

2. **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `b` reaches 0. This prevents infinite recursion.

3. **Handling Negative Numbers:** The code now correctly handles negative numbers by using the following logic:
   - If `b` is negative, the function returns the negative of the product of `a` and `-b`. This ensures correct results for both positive and negative inputs.


4. **No Loops, Bitwise Operations, or Division:**  The solution strictly adheres to the requirements, using only recursion and addition/subtraction.


5. **Clearer Code and Comments:** I've added comments to explain the logic and improved the overall structure for better readability.
  
6. **Test Cases in main():** The `main` method now includes several test cases to demonstrate the functionality with different inputs, including positive, negative and zero values.  This helps verify the correctness of the solution.


This improved version provides a complete and accurate solution that addresses potential issues with negative numbers and overflows while adhering to the specified constraints. It is also well-documented and easier to understand.
