This code:

1. **Handles Input:** It takes an integer `num` as input (currently set to 25, but you can modify it).
2. **Handles Errors:** It checks for negative input and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if encountered.
3. **Handles 0:**  It correctly handles the case where the input is 0.
4. **Integer Square Root:**  It uses an efficient binary search approach to find the integer square root. The result will be the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the input number. This adheres to the typical definition of the integer square root function.
5. **Avoids Overflow:**  The calculation of `mid` uses `left + (right - left) / 2` to avoid potential integer overflow that could happen with `(left + right) / 2`.
6. **Clear Output:** It prints the result to the console in the desired format.
