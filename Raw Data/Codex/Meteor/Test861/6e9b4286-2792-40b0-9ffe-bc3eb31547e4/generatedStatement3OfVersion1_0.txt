**Testing Strategy Summary:**

For this type of program, the testing strategy involves primarily:

- **Visual Inspection:** Carefully examine the output to confirm it matches the expected design.
- **Output Redirection:** Test output to different destinations (console, file).
- **Code Modification (Extension):** Introduce changes to the drawing logic to verify the program adapts correctly.



While not strictly "corner cases" in the traditional sense, these approaches help ensure the correctness and robustness of the face printing program.  If the face was dynamically generated based on input parameters, then more traditional unit tests with different input values would be necessary.
