Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Empty Array:**  Added a check at the beginning of `removeDuplicates` to handle the case where the input array is empty. This prevents potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueCount` is used instead of just `count` to clearly represent the count of unique elements.

3. **In-Place Modification:** The code modifies the original array `nums` in-place as requested by the problem (overwriting duplicates with unique elements).

4. **Return Value:** The function returns the updated length (number of unique elements).

5. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** The `main` method now includes test cases with different array inputs, including an empty array and more complex examples with repeating duplicates, demonstrating the correctness of the `removeDuplicates` function.

6. **Output Formatting:** The `main` method uses `Arrays.toString()` and `Arrays.copyOfRange()` to print only the relevant part of the modified array (up to the new length), making the output easier to understand.



This revised code is more robust, efficient, and adheres more closely to best practices. It is also more thoroughly tested.
