Key improvements in this revised version:

* **Handles Edge Cases:**  It now correctly manages `null` and empty string inputs, returning an empty string in those cases.
* **Trimming Whitespace:** The `trim()` method is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace, preventing extra spaces in the reversed string.
* **Splitting on Multiple Spaces:**  `\\s+` is used in the `split()` method.  This handles cases where there might be multiple spaces between words.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  More descriptive variable names improve readability.
* **Thorough Testing in `main()`:** The `main` method now includes tests with a variety of input strings, including edge cases, to demonstrate the correctness of the `WordsInReverse` method.


This version addresses the original prompt's requirements and provides a robust and well-tested solution for reversing the words in a string.
