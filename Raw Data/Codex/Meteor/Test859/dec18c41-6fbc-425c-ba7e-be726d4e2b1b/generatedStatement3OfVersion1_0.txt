6. **Single-Digit Values:** (Edge Case)
   - Verify that the output correctly pads single-digit months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds with leading zeros (e.g., `2024/01/09 03:05:07.008`).

7. **Leap Year:** (Edge Case)
   - Run the test during a leap year (like 2024) to ensure February 29th is handled correctly.

8. **Time Zone:** (If needed)
   - If you require time zone support, use `ZonedDateTime` instead of `LocalDateTime` and test with different time zones to make sure the output is as expected.




How to run the tests:

You can either create a separate testing class (using JUnit or TestNG, which is recommended for larger projects) or add some simple `assert` statements to your `main` method for basic testing.  The example using a simple `assert` is shown below (but JUnit or TestNG is much better for organized testing).
