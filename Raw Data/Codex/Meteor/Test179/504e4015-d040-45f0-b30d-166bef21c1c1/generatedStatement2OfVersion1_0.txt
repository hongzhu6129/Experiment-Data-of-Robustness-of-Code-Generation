This improved version addresses a few key points:

* **Clarity and Readability:** The output now clearly indicates that the listed zones are those related to UTC and GMT.  
* **Explicit Checks:**  It directly checks for "UTC" and "GMT" and variations like "UTC+1".  This is more precise than simply checking if the zone ID contains the substrings "UTC" or "GMT".  If you *did* want to find *all* zone IDs with "UTC" or "GMT" in their names (even things like "America/Argentina/Ushuaia"), then the commented-out loop would be what you would want.
* **Efficiency (slightly):** Checking for prefixes using `startsWith()` can be slightly more efficient than using `contains()` in some cases.



This code will now specifically show the standard UTC and GMT zones and their offsets while avoiding unnecessary output or potentially confusing results.
