Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:** Includes handling for empty and null input arrays.
- **Clearer pivot selection:**  Uses the middle element as the pivot to avoid worst-case scenarios with already sorted or reverse-sorted data (though true randomness would be even better).
- **Concise variable names:** `i` and `j` are traditional for QuickSort, but using `lowerIndex` and `higherIndex` in the `quickSort` method itself enhances readability where scope is broader.
- **Added comments:** Explaining the logic, especially within the partitioning loop.
- **Third parameter in `exchangeNumbers` and `quicksort`:**  Passes the array explicitly, making it clearer that these methods operate on a specific array.
- **Example Usage and Tests:** Shows how to use the `sort` method and includes test cases with different input arrays (empty, single element, and reverse sorted) to demonstrate its robustness.
