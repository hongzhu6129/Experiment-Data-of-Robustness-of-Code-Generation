Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `inputArr`, `lowerIndex`, `higherIndex` improve readability.
* **Input Validation:** Handles `null` or empty input arrays gracefully.
* **Concise Comments:**  Comments explain the core logic without being verbose.
* **Standard QuickSort Implementation:** This follows a more typical quicksort partitioning strategy, leading to better average-case performance.
* **Output to Console:** The `main` method now prints the sorted array, making it easier to verify the results.
* **Passing the Array:** The `quickSort` and `exchangeNumbers` methods now receive the array as a parameter, which is standard practice and avoids relying on a shared instance variable.
