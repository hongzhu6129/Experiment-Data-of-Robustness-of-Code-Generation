**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The code now correctly reverses negative numbers by storing the sign and applying it after the reversal.
2. **Handles Overflow:**  The crucial addition is overflow checking.  When reversing a large integer, the reversed value might exceed the maximum or minimum value for an `int`. The code uses a `long` to store the reversed value and checks for overflow within the loop.  If overflow occurs, it prints a message (you should handle this based on your application's requirements � throwing an exception might be appropriate).
3. **Clearer Comments:** Added more comments to explain the steps.
4. **Multiple Examples:** Includes examples with positive, negative, and large numbers to demonstrate different scenarios.


**How to Run:**

1. Save the code as `Solution.java`.
2. Compile: `javac Solution.java`
3. Run: `java Solution`



This improved version addresses potential issues and provides a more robust solution for reversing integers.
