Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Case-Insensitive Counting:** The `CountCharacters` method now converts the input string to lowercase using `str.toLowerCase()`. This ensures that 'P' and 'p' are considered the same character.

2. **Clearer Output:** The `showDuplicates` method now provides clearer output messages, including the original string and a message when no duplicates are found.

3. **Character Validation:**  The `Character.isLetter(c)` check in `CountCharacters` now ensures that only letters are counted, avoiding potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if special characters or numbers are present.

4. **Example Usages in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates the usage of `showDuplicates` with various inputs, including those with uppercase letters, mixed cases, and strings without duplicates.

5. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic and the purpose of each part of the code.


How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StringDuplicates.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac StringDuplicates.java`
3. **Run:**  After successful compilation, run the program: `java StringDuplicates`
