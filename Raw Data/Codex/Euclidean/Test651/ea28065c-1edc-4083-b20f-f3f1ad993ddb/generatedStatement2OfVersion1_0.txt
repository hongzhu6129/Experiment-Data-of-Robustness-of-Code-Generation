Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays and `null` input.
* **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` is used to track the index where unique elements are placed, making the code easier to understand.
* **In-place modification:** The algorithm modifies the original array directly, which is generally more efficient.
* **Comprehensive `main` method:** Added more test cases (empty array, null array) to demonstrate the robustness of the solution, and included printing the updated array (using `Arrays.copyOfRange`) to show the result more clearly.  The output now clearly shows the new length *and* the relevant portion of the modified array.



This improved version addresses the potential issues in the previous responses and provides a more robust and well-rounded solution to the problem.
