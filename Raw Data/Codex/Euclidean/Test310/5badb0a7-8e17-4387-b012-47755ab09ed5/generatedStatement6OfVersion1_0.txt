Key improvements:

- **Handles missing file:** Checks if the file exists and prints an error message if it doesn't.
- **Clearer output:**  Uses `System.out` for normal output and `System.err` for error messages.
- **Two methods demonstrated:** Shows how to get the last modified date using both `BasicFileAttributes` (preferred) and `File.lastModified()`. The `BasicFileAttributes` approach provides more detailed information about the file and is generally recommended.
- **Date formatting:** Includes date formatting using `SimpleDateFormat` to make the output more readable.  You can customize the format string if needed.
- **Command-line argument:** Takes the file path as a command-line argument, making it more flexible.
- **Exception handling:**  Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions`.
