2. **Zero Side:**
   - Input: `0`
   - Expected Output: `Side length must be positive.`

3. **Negative Side:**
   - Input: `-2`
   - Expected Output: `Side length must be positive.`

4. **Very Small Side:**
   - Input: `0.001`
   - Expected Output: `0.000002598076211353316` (approximately)  This tests handling of small values.

5. **Large Side:**
   - Input: `1000`
   - Expected Output: `2598076.211353316` (approximately) This tests handling of large values.

6. **Decimal Side:**

**How to Run and Test:**

1. Save the code as `HexagonArea.java`.
2. Compile: `javac HexagonArea.java`
3. Run: `java HexagonArea`

Then, enter the test case input values at the prompt.


This improved version addresses the potential `InputMismatchException` by closing the `Scanner` and includes more comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases. It also provides clear instructions on how to compile and run the code for testing.
