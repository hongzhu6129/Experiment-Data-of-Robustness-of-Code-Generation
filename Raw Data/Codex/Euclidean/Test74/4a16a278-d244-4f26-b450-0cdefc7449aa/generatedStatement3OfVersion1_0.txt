* **Clearer `main` Method:** The `main` method now demonstrates a couple of examples, including a square.
* **Descriptive Test Names:** Test names are more descriptive, making it easier to understand what each test is checking.



How to run the tests (assuming you have JUnit set up):

1. Save the code as `Rectangle.java` and `RectangleTest.java`.
2. Compile: `javac Rectangle.java RectangleTest.java`
3. Run tests: `java org.junit.platform.console.ConsoleLauncher --scan-class-path` (or use your IDE's test runner).


This improved version is more robust, testable, and handles edge cases effectively.  The addition of exception handling significantly improves the code quality.
