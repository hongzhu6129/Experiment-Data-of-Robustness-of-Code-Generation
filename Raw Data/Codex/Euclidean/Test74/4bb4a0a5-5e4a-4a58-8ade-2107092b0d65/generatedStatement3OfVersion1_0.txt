This JUnit test demonstrates how to assert expected values and handle exceptions. You would need to add the JUnit library to your project to run these tests. Automated tests make it much easier to ensure your code behaves correctly as you make changes.


This enhanced answer provides more comprehensive test cases, explains how to test them, and shows the best practice of using automated testing with JUnit. Remember to modify the exception handling in the `Rectangle` class itself if you choose to throw `IllegalArgumentException`.
