Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:** Includes error handling for incorrect command-line arguments and file I/O exceptions.  Prints informative error messages to the user.
* **Clarity and Comments:**  Improved comments and variable names to make the code more understandable.
* **Even Distribution:** Distributes the sorted lines more evenly between the two files, dividing them approximately in half.
* **Resource Management:** Uses try-with-resources to ensure that file readers and writers are closed properly, even in case of exceptions.



To compile and run:

1.  **Save:** Save the code as `LexicographicallyCorrectFiles.java`.
2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then compile using:  `javac LexicographicallyCorrectFiles.java`
3.  **Run:**  `java LexicographicallyCorrectFiles file1.txt file2.txt`  (Replace `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` with the actual names of your files.)


This revised version addresses the previous issues and provides a more robust and clear solution to the problem.
