To compile and run this version (assuming you saved it as `FileSize.java`):

1. `javac FileSize.java`
2. `java FileSize /path/to/file1.txt /path/to/file2.txt etc.`  (Replace with your actual file paths)


This command-line argument version lets the user specify the file paths when running the program. This addresses the limitations of using `Scanner` within the `main` method's specified signature.
