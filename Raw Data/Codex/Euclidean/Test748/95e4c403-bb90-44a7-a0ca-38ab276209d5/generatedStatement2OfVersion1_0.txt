Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles Empty and Null Arrays:**  It explicitly checks for `null` arrays and empty arrays (`length == 0`) to prevent `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Empty arrays are treated as not having the same first and last elements (as per the prompt).
* **Clearer Output:** The `testArrays` method now prints `true` or `false` directly, making the output of the test cases easier to understand.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes more test cases covering various scenarios, including empty arrays, null arrays, and arrays of different lengths.


This revised code is robust, handles edge cases correctly, and demonstrates good coding practices.
