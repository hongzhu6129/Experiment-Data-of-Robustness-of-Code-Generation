Key improvements and explanations in this code:

1. **Clearer Examples:** Provides separate examples for `Integer`, `String`, and custom objects, demonstrating how natural ordering works for different types.

2. **Custom Object Ordering:** Shows how to use the `Comparable` interface to define a custom ordering for objects in the priority queue. This is crucial for using your own classes.

3. **Explanatory Comments:** Includes comments explaining the behavior and output of the priority queue operations.

4. **Improved Output:** The output now clearly shows the state of the queue before and after insertion.

5. **Conciseness:**  The code is more focused and streamlined, demonstrating the core concepts effectively.
