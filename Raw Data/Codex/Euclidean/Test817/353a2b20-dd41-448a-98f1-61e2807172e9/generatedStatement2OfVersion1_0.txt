**Test Cases:**

**1. All different rightmost digits:**
   - Input: 12, 23, 34
   - Expected Output: `false`

**2. Two matching rightmost digits:**
   - Input: 12, 22, 34
   - Expected Output: `true`

**3. All three matching rightmost digits:**
   - Input: 15, 25, 35
   - Expected Output: `true`

**4. Zeroes as rightmost digits:**
   - Input: 10, 20, 30
   - Expected Output: `true`

**5. Single-digit numbers:**
   - Input: 1, 1, 2
   - Expected Output: `true`

**6. Large numbers:**
   - Input: 123456789, 987654321, 111111111 
   - Expected Output: `false`


**7. Corner Case:  Numbers with leading zeros (will be treated as octal in Java if you don't handle input carefully):**
   - Input: 012, 022, 034  (If you directly parse these with `nextInt`,  012 will be treated as octal 10, 022 as octal 18, and so on). 
   - Expected Behavior: Your code should ideally prevent direct octal interpretation or handle the case of leading zeros appropriately.

**8. Corner Case: Negative numbers:**
    - Input: -12, 22, 32
    - Expected Behavior: Print the error message "Error: Input integers must be non-negative." and exit.


These test cases cover various scenarios, including matching digits, different digits, zeros, single-digit numbers, large numbers, and corner cases involving leading zeros and negative inputs, which are important for ensuring the robustness of your code.
