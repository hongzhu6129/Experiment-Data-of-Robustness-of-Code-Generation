Key improvements:

* **Handles empty arrays:**  The code now correctly handles the case where the input array is empty.
* **Clearer variable naming:** `uniqueIndex` replaces `k` for better readability.
* **Improved comments:**  The comments explain the logic more effectively.
* **Example Usage in `main`:** Demonstrates how to use the `removeDuplicates` function and how to print the updated array (using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid printing the unchanged portion of the original array).  Also includes a test case with an empty array.


This improved version addresses the potential edge case and provides a more robust and understandable solution.
