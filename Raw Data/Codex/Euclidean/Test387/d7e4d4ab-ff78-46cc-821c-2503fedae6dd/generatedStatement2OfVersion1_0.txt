**Test Cases (While you can't directly "test" output like this with JUnit, these are examples of how to verify visually):**

1. **Basic Output:** Run the program directly and visually inspect the output.  It should match the face as described in the prompt.

2. **Character Encoding:**  Ensure your console or output stream is set to a character encoding that supports the characters used (like UTF-8). If it's not, you might see distorted characters.  You can sometimes set this in your IDE or terminal settings.
