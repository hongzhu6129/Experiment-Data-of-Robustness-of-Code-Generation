Key improvements:

- **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` input, returning 0 in both cases.
- **Clearer variable naming:** `uniqueIndex` replaces `k` for better readability.
- **In-place modification:** Modifies the original `nums` array as requested.
- **Comprehensive main method:** Includes multiple test cases with various scenarios, including edge cases, demonstrating the function's correctness.
- **Correct output:** Prints the updated length AND the updated portion of the array using `Arrays.copyOfRange()` to avoid showing the unmodified elements beyond the new length.



This revised solution is more robust, efficient, and adheres to best coding practices, making it easier to understand and maintain.
