Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity in Output:** The output now clearly distinguishes between:
   - Hours: Total difference in hours.
   - Minutes (within the hour): The remaining minutes after calculating the hours.
   - Total Minutes: The complete difference expressed in minutes.
   - Milliseconds (within the second):  The remaining milliseconds after calculating seconds.
   - Total Milliseconds: The complete difference expressed in milliseconds.
   - Nanoseconds (within the second): The remaining nanoseconds after calculating seconds.


2. **Modern Date/Time API:** Uses `java.time` (introduced in Java 8) for cleaner and more reliable date/time handling.  Avoid the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes as they have known design flaws.

3. **`Duration` for Time Differences:** `Duration` is specifically designed for representing differences between time points. It handles the complexities of time units correctly.

4. **`toMinutesPart()`, `toMillisPart()`, `toNanosPart()`:** These methods directly give you the minute, millisecond, and nanosecond parts within the corresponding larger units (hour and second). This prevents incorrect calculations and makes the code simpler to read and understand.


5. **Example Usage:**  Provides example dates so you can see how to use the code.  Replace these with your own date values.

6. **Total Minutes/Milliseconds:** The code now also shows how to get the _total_ difference expressed in minutes or milliseconds, if that's what you need.

7. **Nanoseconds:** The large `toNanos()` value might not always be practically useful, so the output focuses on nanoseconds within the second. It also explains how to get the total nanoseconds if necessary.
