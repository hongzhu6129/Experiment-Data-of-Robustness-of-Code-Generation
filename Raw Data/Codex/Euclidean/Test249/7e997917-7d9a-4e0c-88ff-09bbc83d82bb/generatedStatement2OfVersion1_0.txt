**Explanation:**

1. **`checkExistance(String word, String item)`:**
   - Takes the given `word` and an `item` from the list as input.
   - Checks if the `item`'s length is at least 3 characters.
   - Iterates through the `item` using a sliding window of size 3.
   - Extracts a 3-character substring (`sub`) in each iteration.
   - Uses `word.contains(sub)` to efficiently check if the `word` contains the current 3-character substring.
   - If a match is found, it prints the `item` and immediately returns to avoid printing the same item multiple times (if it contains multiple 3-character matches).

2. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - Defines the example `word`.
   - Creates a sample list of `items` (you can modify this list with your own data).
   - Iterates through the `items` list.
   - Calls `checkExistance()` for each `item` to check and print if it contains a 3-character sequence from the `word`.
