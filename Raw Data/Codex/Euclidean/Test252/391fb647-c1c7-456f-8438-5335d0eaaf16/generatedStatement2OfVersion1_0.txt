Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic, particularly the `n--` adjustment.
* **StringBuilder:** Using `StringBuilder` is more efficient than repeated string concatenation, especially for larger column numbers.
* **Correct Handling of Large Numbers:** The code now correctly handles column numbers beyond double letters (like 703 which is AAA or 16384 which is XFD).
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  Included a more extensive set of test cases in `main` to demonstrate the code's correctness for different scenarios, including edge cases and larger numbers.
* **Prepending Characters:** The code now uses `sb.insert(0, ch)` to insert the calculated character at the beginning of the StringBuilder. This is crucial for constructing the column title correctly, as the characters are determined from right to left.


This revised code provides a more robust, efficient, and clearly explained solution to the Excel column title problem.
