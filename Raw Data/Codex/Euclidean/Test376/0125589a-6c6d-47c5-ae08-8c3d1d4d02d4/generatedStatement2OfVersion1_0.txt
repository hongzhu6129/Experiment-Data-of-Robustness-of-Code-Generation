Explanation:

1. **Import Necessary Classes:** We import `java.util.TimeZone` and `java.util.Set` to work with time zones and sets of strings.
2. **Get Available Time Zone IDs:**  `TimeZone.getAvailableIDs()` returns a `Set` containing all available time zone IDs as strings.
3. **Iterate and Display:** We loop through each `zoneId` in the set. Inside the loop:
   - We get a `TimeZone` object for the current ID using `TimeZone.getTimeZone(zoneId)`.
   - We use `tz.getRawOffset()` to get the offset from UTC in milliseconds.  We divide by `(1000 * 60 * 60)` to convert milliseconds to hours.
   - We print the time zone ID and its UTC/GMT offset.  The GMT offset is the same as the UTC offset, so we print the same value twice.  There's no separate "GMT offset" method.  GMT is effectively UTC for time zone purposes.



Key improvements in this code:

- **Clarity:**  The code is well-commented, explaining each step.
- **Correctness:** It accurately displays the UTC/GMT offset.  There is no distinction between UTC and GMT offset in the `TimeZone` class.
- **Efficiency:** It uses the standard `TimeZone` class and avoids any unnecessary computations.
- **Formatting:** The output is formatted for better readability.
