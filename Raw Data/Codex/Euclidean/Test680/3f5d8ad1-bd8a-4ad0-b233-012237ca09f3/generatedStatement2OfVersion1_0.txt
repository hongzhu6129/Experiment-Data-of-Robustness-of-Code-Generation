**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **TreeMap:** We use `TreeMap` which is a sorted map implementation in Java.  This is crucial because it allows efficient retrieval of the least key greater than or equal to a given key.

2. **ceilingKey():**  The `ceilingKey(K key)` method of `TreeMap` is the core of the solution.  It returns the least key greater than or equal to the given `key`, or `null` if no such key exists.

3. **Generics <K, V>:**  The method `getKeyValueForLeastKeyGreaterThanOrEqualTo` uses generics `<K, V>` to make it work with various key-value types (e.g., Integer-String, String-Integer).  This is good practice for writing reusable code.

4. **Map.Entry:**  Instead of just returning the value, we return a `Map.Entry<K, V>`. This is a better approach as it provides both the key and the value associated with the least key found. It also avoids potential issues if the value itself could be null.


5. **Null Handling:**  The code includes checks for `null` or empty `treeMap` to prevent `NullPointerExceptions`.

6. **Clear Example Usage:** The `main` method provides several test cases to demonstrate how the method works with different inputs and data types, making it easier to understand.



This improved version is more robust, efficient, and provides a better learning experience by showcasing good practices and providing clear examples.
