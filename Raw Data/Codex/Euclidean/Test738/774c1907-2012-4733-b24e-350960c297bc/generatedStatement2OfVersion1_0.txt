**Explanation:**

The fact that this code compiles and runs is proof that Java is installed.  Furthermore, we use `System.getProperty()` to access and print key information about the Java installation, mirroring the details provided in the problem description. This provides additional confirmation and displays the specifics of the Java environment.


**To compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CheckJavaInstallation.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac CheckJavaInstallation.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code with: `java CheckJavaInstallation`


This will print the output to the console, confirming the Java installation and providing details about the version, vendor, and other relevant information.
