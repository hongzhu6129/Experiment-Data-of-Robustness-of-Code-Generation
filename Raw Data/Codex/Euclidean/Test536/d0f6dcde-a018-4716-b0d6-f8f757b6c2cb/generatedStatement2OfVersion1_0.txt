Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is now well-commented, explaining the purpose of each function and section.  Variable names are more descriptive (e.g., `containsDigit7`).
* **Helper Function:**  The `containsDigit7` function makes the logic cleaner and easier to understand. The main `count_nums_not_7` function focuses on the counting aspect.
* **Example Usage in main:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `count_nums_not_7` function with sample inputs, making the code more practical.
* **Efficiency (Minor):** While the core logic remains the same (iterating and checking each number), the helper function slightly improves organization and could be optimized further if needed for very large ranges.

This revised version is more robust, understandable, and follows best practices for Java coding.
