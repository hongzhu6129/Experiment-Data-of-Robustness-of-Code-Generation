By running these unit tests, you can ensure that the `findLargest` method works correctly for a range of inputs, making your code more robust and reliable.  JUnit provides the `assertEquals` method (and other assertion methods) to check if the actual output matches the expected output.  Most IDEs have integrated support for running JUnit tests.


Key improvements in this revised answer:

* **Clearer Test Cases:**  The test cases are presented in a table format, making them easy to understand and execute.
* **Corner Cases Included:** The test cases now include important corner cases like equal numbers, zero, and the maximum/minimum integer values.
* **Automated Testing Example:**  The answer provides an example of how to automate these tests using JUnit, which is best practice for Java development.  This helps to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed in the `main` method to release the resource.
