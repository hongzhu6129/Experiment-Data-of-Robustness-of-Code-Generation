12. (approximate p) p can be computed using the following formula: p + 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) + (1/9) - (1/11).. ) write a program that displays the result of 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) + (1/9) - (1/11))and 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) + (1/9) - (1/11) + (1/13)use 1. 0 instead of 1 in yourprogram.
The programming language is Java.
 Problem Id is : 140fc0c9-e0af-424b-a7e8-4d60ac8a87b2.
