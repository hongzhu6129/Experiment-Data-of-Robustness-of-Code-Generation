3. (approximate p) l can be computed using the following formula: p = 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) + (1/9) - (1/11).. ) write a program that displays the result of 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) + (1/9) - (1/11))and 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) + (1/9) - (1/11) + (1/13)use 1. 0 instead of 1 in yourprogram.
The programming language is Java.
 Problem Id is : 778dc3a5-4e35-489a-b304-1f2898b88c40.
