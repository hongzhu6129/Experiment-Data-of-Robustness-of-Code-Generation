Key improvements:

* **Handles exceptions:** Uses a `try-catch` block to gracefully handle `DateTimeParseException` if the input string is not in the expected format. This prevents the program from crashing.
* **Clearer formatting:** Uses `DateTimeFormatter` for both parsing and formatting, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
* **Handles date, time and datetime separately**:  Shows examples for parsing and formatting date only, time only, and combined date and time values.
* **Illustrates custom formatting:** Demonstrates how to parse and format dates and times using custom patterns.
* **Uses modern Java time API:** Leverages the `java.time` package (introduced in Java 8) for better date and time handling.  Avoids the older, less robust `Date` and `Calendar` classes.
* **Comments:** Explains the code's purpose and the different parts.


This improved version is more robust, easier to read, and provides a better understanding of how to convert between strings and dates/times in Java.
