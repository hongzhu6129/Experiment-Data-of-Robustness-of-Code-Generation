This code will produce output close to the desired flag.  It's difficult to perfectly replicate the aspect ratio and spacing using only text output. You might need to adjust the spacing in the starred section (around the `==`) to achieve better visual alignment in your specific console or output environment.  A more advanced approach would involve using a graphics library to create a visually accurate flag.
