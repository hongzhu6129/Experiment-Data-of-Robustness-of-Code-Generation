nullInput Sentence 1:  \nWrite a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the Pancake sort algorithm.\nPancake sorting is the colloquial term for the mathematical problem of sorting a disordered stack of pancakes in order of size. This is when a spatula can be inserted at any point in the stack and used to flip all pancakes above it. Pancake numbers are the minimum number of flips required for a given number of pancakes. The problem was first discussed by American geometer Jacob E. Goodman. It is a variation of the sorting problem in which the only allowed operation is to reverse the elements of some prefix of the sequence.
