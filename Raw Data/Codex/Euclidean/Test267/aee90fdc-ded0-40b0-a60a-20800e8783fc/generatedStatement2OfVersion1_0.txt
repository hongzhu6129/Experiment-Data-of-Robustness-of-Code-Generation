**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that can occur when reading a file (e.g., file not found). This prevents the program from crashing and provides a helpful error message.

2. **Resource Management:** The `BufferedReader` is used inside a `try-with-resources` block. This ensures that the `BufferedReader` (and the underlying `FileReader`) are automatically closed, even if an exception occurs.  This is crucial for preventing resource leaks.

3. **Dynamic Sizing using `ArrayList`:**  An `ArrayList` is used to store the lines initially. `ArrayList`s grow dynamically, so you don't need to know the number of lines in the file beforehand.

4. **Conversion to `String[]` (if necessary):** After reading all lines into the `ArrayList`, the code shows how to convert it to a `String[]` if you specifically require an array.

5. **Clearer Method for Reading:** The file reading logic is encapsulated in a separate `readLinesFromFile` method to improve code organization and readability.

6. **File Path:**  The file path is now a variable, making it easier to change.  Make sure you replace `"products.txt"` with the actual path to your text file.



**How to use:**

1. **Create a text file:** Create a file named `products.txt` (or whatever you set `filePath` to) in the same directory as your Java source code file.  Populate the file with the product data, one product per line.
2. **Compile and run:** Compile and run the Java code. The contents of the file will be stored in the `productArray`.


This improved version is more robust, efficient, and adheres to best coding practices.
