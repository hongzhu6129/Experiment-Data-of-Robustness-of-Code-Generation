 Only use the method signatures public static void main(String[]),  static int ternary_search(int[], int, int, int) to generate code for the problem description: write a Java program. find a specified element in a given array of elements using ternary search. from wikipedia, a ternary search algorithm is a technique in computer science for finding the minimum or maximum of a unimodal function. a ternary search determines either that the minimum or maximum cannot be in the first third of the domain or that it cannot be in the last third of the domain, then repeats on the remaining two thirds. a ternary search is an example of a divide and conquer algorithm.
The programming language is Java.
