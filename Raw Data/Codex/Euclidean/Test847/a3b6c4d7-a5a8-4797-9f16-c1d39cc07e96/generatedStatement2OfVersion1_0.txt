**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input (num1, num2, num3) | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10, 20, 30 | 20.0 | Standard positive numbers |
| 2 | -5, 0, 5 | 0.0 | Includes negative and zero |
| 3 | 0, 0, 0 | 0.0 | All zeros |
| 4 | 1.5, 2.5, 3.0 | 2.3333333333333335 | Floating-point numbers |
| 5 | Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE | Overflow:  Infinity (Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY) | Integer overflow check for doubles (doubles have a much larger range, so they might not overflow in the same way ints would, but this is still a good test) |
| 6 | Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE | Underflow:  Large negative number (Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY) | Integer underflow check |
| 7 | Double.MAX_VALUE, Double.MAX_VALUE, Double.MAX_VALUE | Infinity (Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY) | Double Overflow |
| 8 | Double.MIN_VALUE, Double.MIN_VALUE, Double.MIN_VALUE | Very small number (Close to 0) | Double underflow (Doesn't become -Infinity, but very close to zero). |



**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You could manually input these values into the program, but a more efficient and robust way to test is to create automated tests using a testing framework like JUnit. Here's a basic example using JUnit:
