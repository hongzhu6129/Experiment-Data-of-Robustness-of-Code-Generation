**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Locale-Specific Formatting:**  Uses `NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.US)` to ensure comma is used as the thousands separator, regardless of the user's locale. This is crucial for consistent and correct formatting.

2. **Handles Negative Numbers:**  The provided code now correctly formats negative numbers with the comma separators and the negative sign.

3. **Handles Zero:** Correctly formats zero.

4. **Clearer Example in `main`:**  Demonstrates how to use the `validate` method with various inputs and shows an example of parsing the formatted string back to an integer if that's a requirement of your broader application.  The `try-catch` block is included to handle potential `NumberFormatException` during parsing.

5. **Conciseness and Efficiency:**  The code is more concise and efficient, leveraging the built-in `NumberFormat` class which is designed for this specific purpose.


This improved version addresses all the potential issues and provides a robust and locale-aware solution for adding thousand separators to integers in Java.
