Key improvements and explanations in this optimized version:

1. **Avoids Duplicate Pairs:** The inner loops (for `b` and `d`) start from `a + 1` and `c + 1` respectively. This ensures that we don't count the same pair of cubes twice (e.g., 1� + 12� and 12� + 1� are considered the same).


2. **Early Exit Optimization:** Inside the inner loops, if the sum (`sum1` or `sum2`) exceeds `n`, the loops are immediately broken using `break`.  This is a significant optimization because it avoids unnecessary calculations.

3. **Distinct Pair Check:** The condition `(a != c || b != d)` explicitly checks that the pairs of cubes are distinct.

4. **Clear Output:** The output is formatted to clearly show the number and its two representations as sums of cubes.


5. **Optional Early Return:** If you only need to find *one* such number, the `return;` statement after printing the result will exit the program immediately, preventing further unnecessary computation.  If you want to find *all* such numbers up to `n`, remove the `return;` statement.


6. **Uses Nested Loops Efficiently:** The nested loop structure is necessary to check all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, but the optimizations make the process much more efficient.



This revised code is more efficient and directly addresses the requirements of the problem while providing a clear and understandable solution.
