Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Names:** Using names like `root1`, `root2`, etc., makes the example usage easier to understand.
* **More Comprehensive Examples:** Added examples to demonstrate cases where trees are not identical due to structural differences or different values.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic within the `is_Identical_tree_node` method.
* **TreeNode Class:** Included a `TreeNode` class for better structure and clarity.



This revised response provides a more robust and understandable solution to the problem of checking for identical binary trees.
