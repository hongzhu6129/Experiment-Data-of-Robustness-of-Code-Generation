**Explanation:**

1. **`main` method:**
   - Initializes a sample 2D array `arr` (sorted row-wise and column-wise).
   - Sets `m` and `n` to the dimensions of the array.
   - Sets `target` to the value we're searching for.
   - Calls the `Saddleback` method to perform the search.
   - Prints the result based on the return value of `Saddleback`.

2. **`Saddleback` method:**
   - Takes the 2D array, dimensions `m` and `n`, and the `target` value as input.
   - Initializes `row` to 0 and `col` to `n-1` (top-right corner).
   - Enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `row` is within the array bounds and `col` is non-negative.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `arr[row][col]` equals `target`, the element is found, and its row and column indices are returned in an `int[]`.
     - If `arr[row][col]` is less than `target`, it means the target must be in a lower row, so `row` is incremented.
     - If `arr[row][col]` is greater than `target`, it means the target must be in a column to the left, so `col` is decremented.
   - If the loop completes without finding the target, it returns `{-1, -1}` to indicate that the element was not found.


**Key Idea of Saddleback Search:**

Saddleback search efficiently utilizes the sorted nature of the array. By starting at the top-right corner, we can eliminate either a row or a column in each comparison.  If the current element is smaller than the target, the entire row above it can be eliminated. If the current element is larger than the target, the entire column to its right can be eliminated. This allows us to search the matrix in O(m+n) time, which is better than a linear search through all elements.
