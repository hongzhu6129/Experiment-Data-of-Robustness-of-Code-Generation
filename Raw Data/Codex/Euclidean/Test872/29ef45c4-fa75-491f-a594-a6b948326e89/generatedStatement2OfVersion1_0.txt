Key improvements:

* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `m` and `n` are more descriptive than the original single-letter variables.
* **Returns an Array:** The `Saddleback` function now returns an `int[]` containing the row and column index.  This makes it much easier to handle the case where the target is not found.  A `{-1, -1}` is returned to indicate this.
* **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to call the `Saddleback` method and interpret its result. It also includes an example where the target is not found.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic.
* **Error Handling:** Explicitly handles the case where the target is not found.


This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and follows best practices.
