To compile and run with user input:

1.  **Save:** Save the code as `EvenOddCounter.java`.
2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile:  `javac EvenOddCounter.java`
3.  **Run:** `java EvenOddCounter 1 2 3 4 5 6`  (Replace `1 2 3 4 5 6` with your desired integer inputs).


Key improvements in this version:

*   **Clearer Variable Names:** More descriptive names like `evenCount` and `oddCount`.
*   **Enhanced Output:** Includes labels for even and odd counts.
*   **Basic User Input Handling (Within main limitations):**  Demonstrates how to accept input from command-line arguments (with basic error handling) while respecting the `void main(String[])` constraint.  It's important to understand this user input approach is simplified.  More robust input handling would involve using `Scanner` (which is generally done outside the `main` method) or other methods for a better user experience.



If you need more advanced user input (like accepting input from the console during runtime), you would typically create separate helper methods and use `Scanner`. However, this version demonstrates a way to manage it within `main` for a basic example.
