**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **File Path:**  The `filePath` variable stores the location of your text file.  Make sure to replace `"path/to/your/textfile.txt"` with the correct path.  You can use relative paths (from your project's directory) or absolute paths.


2. **Try-with-resources:** This ensures that the `BufferedReader` and `FileReader` are closed automatically, even if exceptions occur.  This is crucial for proper file handling and preventing resource leaks.


3. **BufferedReader:** `BufferedReader` reads the file efficiently, buffering the input for better performance.  `FileReader` is used to create a stream from the file.


4. **Reading Line by Line:** The `readLine()` method reads one line at a time from the file and returns it as a `String`. The loop continues until `readLine()` returns `null`, indicating the end of the file.


5. **Processing Each Line:** Inside the loop, you can do whatever you need with each line of text. The example simply prints each line to the console.


6. **Exception Handling:** The `catch` block handles any `IOException` that might occur (e.g., the file doesn't exist or there's a permission problem). It's important to handle these exceptions gracefully to prevent your program from crashing.


7. **File Reading Complete Message:** This is a simple way to indicate that the file has been processed entirely.


**To Compile and Run:**

1. Save the code as `ReadPlainTextFile.java`.
2. Compile: `javac ReadPlainTextFile.java`
3. Run: `java ReadPlainTextFile`


Make sure you have a text file at the path you specify in the code.
