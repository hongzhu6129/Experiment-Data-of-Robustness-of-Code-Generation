**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Exception Handling:** The `combineStrings` method now throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the input strings have the same length.  This makes the function more robust. The main method demonstrates how to handle this exception.  I've also added tests for null string inputs, which will throw a `NullPointerException`.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `shortStr` and `longStr` makes the code easier to read.

3. **Ternary Operator:** The ternary operator simplifies the logic for determining the shorter and longer strings.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**
   - `testDifferentLengths`: Tests the normal case where strings have different lengths.
   - `testEmptyStrings`: Checks behavior with empty strings as input.  These are important corner cases.
   - `testSameLengthStrings`: Verifies that the `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when strings have equal length.
   - `testNullStrings`: Tests how the function handles null inputs.
   - `testWithSpecialCharacters`: Ensures the function works correctly with special characters in the strings.
   - `testWithNumbers`: Checks the function's behavior with numeric strings.


**How to Run Tests:**

If you are using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you can usually right-click on the test methods and choose "Run".

From the command line, if you have JUnit 5 set up in your project, you can typically run the tests with a command like:
