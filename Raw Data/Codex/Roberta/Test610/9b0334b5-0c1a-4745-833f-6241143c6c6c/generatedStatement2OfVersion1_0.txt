Key improvements:

- **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty and null input arrays.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` makes the code easier to understand.
- **In-place modification:** The duplicates are removed within the original array itself as requested.
- **Comprehensive `main` method:** The `main` method now includes multiple test cases demonstrating the function's behavior with different inputs, including empty and null arrays.  It also uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant part of the modified array.
- **Comments:** Added comments to clarify the code's logic.
