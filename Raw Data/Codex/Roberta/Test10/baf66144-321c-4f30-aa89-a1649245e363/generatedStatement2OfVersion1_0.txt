Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays and null input.
* **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` is used instead of just `i`  making the code more readable.
* **Comprehensive testing in main:**  The `main` method now tests several cases, including empty arrays, null input, and single element arrays, demonstrating correct behavior in all scenarios.
* **Output formatted to match the prompt:** The output in the `main` method shows the length and the updated array (the relevant portion), consistent with the example provided in the problem description.
* **Uses Arrays.copyOfRange:**  To print only the relevant part of the array after removing duplicates, we now use `Arrays.copyOfRange` which avoids showing the "garbage" values after the unique elements.


This revised code is more robust, readable, and adheres closely to the problem's requirements.
