Key improvements and explanations:

1. **HashMap for Efficient Lookup:**  The code uses a `HashMap` to store cumulative sums and their corresponding indices. This allows for efficient checking if a sum has been encountered before, which is crucial for finding subarrays with a sum of zero.

2. **Handling Subarrays Starting at Index 0:** The line `sumMap.put(0, -1);` is added to handle cases where a subarray with a sum of zero starts at the very beginning of the array.

3. **Clearer Return Value:** The function now returns an empty `List` if no subarray with a sum of zero is found, making the behavior more explicit.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes a variety of test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the code, including cases with subarrays at the beginning, single zero elements, and cases where no such subarray exists.

5. **Improved Comments:** The comments have been enhanced to better explain the logic and purpose of different parts of the code.


This revised version is more efficient, robust, and easier to understand.
