**For `countThreeDigitNumbers()`:**

1. **Correctness Test:** The function should always return 64 (4 * 4 * 4), as there are 4 choices for each of the three digits.  You could  modify the function to take the number of allowed digits and the number of digits to form as parameters and then create a more comprehensive test suite.
