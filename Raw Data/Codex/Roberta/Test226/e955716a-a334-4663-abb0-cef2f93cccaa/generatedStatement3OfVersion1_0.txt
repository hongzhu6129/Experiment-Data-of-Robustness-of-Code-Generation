**How to Test:**

The easiest way to test these cases is to:

1. **Create a separate test class:** Make a new Java file (e.g., `UniqueThreeDigitNumbersTest.java`) to hold your test methods. Use a testing framework like JUnit (recommended) or TestNG to structure your tests.
2. **Call `main()` indirectly:** Instead of running `main()` directly, call the core logic within your test methods and then use `assert` statements (or the JUnit/TestNG equivalents) to verify that the output (the `Set` of unique numbers and the count) is what you expect.


By systematically testing your code with various inputs, especially corner cases, you can significantly increase your confidence in its correctness and robustness.
