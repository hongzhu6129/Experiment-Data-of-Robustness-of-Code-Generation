Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** More descriptive variable names (e.g., `minYear`, `minMonth`) improve readability.

2. **ISO 8601 Week Numbers:**  Uses `WeekFields.of(Locale.getDefault()).weekOfYear()` to get the week number according to the ISO 8601 standard, where weeks start on Monday. This provides more consistent and internationally understood week numbers.

3. **Holiday Example:** Includes an example array of `LocalDate` holidays to demonstrate how to find minimums across a set of dates.

4. **Minimum Day of Week:** Demonstrates how to find the minimum day of the week using the `getDayOfWeek()` method.

5. **Day of Year Consideration:**  Includes calculation for the day of the year but explains why it's not always meaningful for comparing minimums across different years.

6. **Comments and Explanations:** Added comments to explain the logic and the use of different `java.time` methods.


This improved version addresses the prompt more directly, provides more accurate and internationally consistent week numbers, and gives a clear example of how to use the concepts with a set of dates.
