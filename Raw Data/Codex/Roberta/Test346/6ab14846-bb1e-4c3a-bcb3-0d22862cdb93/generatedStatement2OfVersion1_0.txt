Here's how this code addresses the problem:

1. **Input:** It takes the number of hours and minutes as input from the user.
2. **Current Date and Time:** `LocalDateTime.now()` gets the current date and time.
3. **Calculating Past Date and Time:** `minus(hours, ChronoUnit.HOURS)` and `minus(minutes, ChronoUnit.MINUTES)` subtract the specified hours and minutes from the current date and time.
4. **Formatting:** `DateTimeFormatter` is used to format the date and time into a readable string (you can customize the format if needed).
5. **Output:** It prints both the current date and time and the calculated past date and time.
6. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed to release the resource.


**Example Usage:**

If the current date and time is 2024-07-27 15:30:00, and the user enters 2 hours and 15 minutes, the output would be:
