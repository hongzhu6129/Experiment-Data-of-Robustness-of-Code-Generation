 Only use the method signatures public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the problem description: write a Java program to check whether a number is a harshad number or not. in recreational mathematics, a harshad number in a given number base, is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits when written in that base. example: number 200 is a sphenic number because the sum of digits 2 and 0 and 0 is 2(2+0+0) and 200 is divisible by 2. number 171 is a harshad number because the sum of digits 1 and 7 and 1 is 9(1+7+1) and 171 is divisible by 9. input a number: 353 353 is not a harshad number.
The programming language is Java.
