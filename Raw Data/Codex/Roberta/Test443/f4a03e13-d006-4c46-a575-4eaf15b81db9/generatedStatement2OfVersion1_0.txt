**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | num3 | Expected Output | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 22 | 32 | 42 | `true` | All numbers have the same rightmost digit (2). |
| 2 | 15 | 25 | 41 | `true` | num1 and num2 share the same rightmost digit (5). |
| 3 | 10 | 20 | 30 | `true` | All numbers share the same rightmost digit (0). |
| 4 | 1 | 2 | 3 | `false` | No numbers share the same rightmost digit. |
| 5 | 123 | 456 | 789 | `false` | No numbers share the same rightmost digit. |
| 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | `true` | All numbers are 0 (and share the rightmost digit 0). |  // Corner case: all zeros
| 7 | 100 | 200 | 300 | `true` | All numbers have 0 as the rightmost digit. | //Corner case: multiples of 10
| 8 | 1 | 11 | 21 | `true` |  Testing with numbers that have the same rightmost digit but different numbers of digits.|
| 9 | 99 | 19 | 29 | `true` |  Testing with two-digit and one-digit numbers. |
| 10 | 5 | 12 | 5 | `true` |  Testing when the first and third numbers are the same.|



These test cases cover various combinations of same and different rightmost digits, including cases with zeros and numbers with varying numbers of digits.  Always try to include a variety of test cases like these when testing your code to ensure its robustness.
