This educational example demonstrates three ways to reverse an ArrayList in Java:

1. **`Collections.reverse()`:** This is the simplest and most recommended approach for most cases. It efficiently reverses the order of elements within the original ArrayList.

2. **Loop to create a new reversed list:** This method iterates through the original ArrayList from the last element to the first, adding each element to a new ArrayList. This creates a reversed copy, leaving the original list unchanged.  It's less efficient because it creates a new list.

3. **In-place reversal using a loop:**  This method reverses the ArrayList by swapping elements from the beginning and end, working inwards. This is the most efficient if you *need* to modify the list in place, but `Collections.reverse()` is generally preferred for its clarity and conciseness.  I've included both `Collections.swap()` and commented-out code showing how to do the swap manually.
