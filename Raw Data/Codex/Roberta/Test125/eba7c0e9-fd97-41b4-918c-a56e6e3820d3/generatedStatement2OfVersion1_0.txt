This code demonstrates three different ways to find the intersection of two sets:

1. **`retainAll()`:** This method modifies the first set by removing elements not present in the second set.  We create a copy of `set1` first to demonstrate this and avoid altering the original `set1`. This is the most efficient method if you want to modify one of the original sets directly.

2. **Loop and `contains()`:** This method iterates through the first set and checks if each element is present in the second set.  If it is, the element is added to a new intersection set.  This approach is useful when you don't want to modify the original sets.

3. **Java 8 Streams:** This approach uses the `filter()` method of streams to filter the elements of `set1` based on whether they are present in `set2`. The `collect()` method then accumulates the filtered elements into a new set.  This is a concise and often efficient approach.


The output clearly shows the original sets and the resulting intersection set for each method, making it easy to understand how each method works.
