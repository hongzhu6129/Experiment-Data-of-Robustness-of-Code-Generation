**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer File Path:**  The code now explicitly shows how to set the `filePath`.  It also includes an example of using a *relative* path.

2. **Try-with-resources:** This is the recommended way to handle file I/O in Java. It ensures the file is closed automatically, even if exceptions occur.

3. **Efficient `List<String>` and Java 11+:`** The most concise way to read lines from a file is using `reader.lines().toList()` (available from Java 11). The code demonstrates this and provides the older alternative for compatibility.

4. **`List` to `Array` Conversion:**  Shows how to convert the `List<String>` to a `String[]` using `toArray()`.

5. **Enhanced For Loop:** Uses an enhanced `for` loop for printing, which is generally preferred for readability.

6. **Error Handling:** Includes a `catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions`. This is crucial for robust file handling.

7. **Relative Path Example:** Demonstrates how to read a file located in the same directory as your .java file using a relative path.

8. **Comments:** Added comments to explain each part of the code.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FileToArray.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac FileToArray.java`
3. **Run:** `java FileToArray`

Make sure you replace `"path/to/your/file.txt"` with the actual path to your text file or place a file named "my_file.txt" in the same directory.
