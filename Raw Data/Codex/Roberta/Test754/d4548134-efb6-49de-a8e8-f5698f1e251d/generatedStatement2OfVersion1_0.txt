**Explanation:**

1. **`Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar();`**: This creates a `GregorianCalendar` object, which is a concrete implementation of the `Calendar` abstract class. By default, it's initialized to the current date and time in your system's default time zone.

2. **`calendar.getMaximum(field)`**: The `getMaximum()` method of the `Calendar` class is used to retrieve the maximum value for a given calendar field. The fields are represented by constants like `Calendar.YEAR`, `Calendar.MONTH`, `Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR`, and `Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH`.

3. **Output**: The code then prints the maximum values for each of these fields.  Important note: the month is 0-indexed, meaning 0 represents January, 1 represents February, and so on, up to 11 for December.


**Key Improvements in this version:**

- **Clarity**:  Clearer comments and variable names (e.g., `maxDate` instead of just `max`).
- **Correctness**: Uses `Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH`  (which is what the problem description intends) to get the maximum day of the month (1-31) correctly.   `DAY_OF_YEAR` would give you 365/366.
- **Standard Practice**: Uses `GregorianCalendar` which is the recommended concrete `Calendar` implementation.
- **Conciseness**:  No unnecessary imports or code.
