This code demonstrates two primary ways to check if an `ArrayList` (or any `List` implementation) is empty:

1. **`isEmpty()` method:** This is the most direct and efficient way.  It directly checks if the list contains any elements.

2. **`size()` method:** You can also check if the `size()` of the list is equal to 0.  This also indicates emptiness, but `isEmpty()` is generally preferred for clarity and potential performance benefits (though the difference is usually negligible).


The examples illustrate how to use both methods and clearly show the output in different scenarios (empty list vs. list with elements).
