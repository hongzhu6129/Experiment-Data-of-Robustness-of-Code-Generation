**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Efficiency:** The original nested loop structure checked many redundant combinations.  This improved version significantly reduces those by:
   - Starting `b` from `a + 1` and `d` from `c + 1`:  This avoids checking the same pair in reverse order (e.g., 1^3 + 12^3  and 12^3 + 1^3).
   - `break` statements: These exit loops early when the sums exceed `n`, preventing unnecessary calculations.

2. **Clarity:** The code is more readable with better variable names and comments.

3. **`return` statement:** Once a Ramanujan number is found, the program exits immediately using `return`.  This is because the problem statement asks for *any* such number.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type:
