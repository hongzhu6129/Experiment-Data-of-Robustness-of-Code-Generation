Key improvements and explanations in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is now formatted better with comments explaining the logic and optimizations.
* **Efficiency Improvements:**
    * Added `break` statements inside loops to prevent unnecessary calculations when the sum or cube exceeds the target value `n`. This significantly speeds up the process, especially for larger values of `n`.
    * `b` now starts from `a + 1` to avoid checking duplicate pairs (e.g., 1^3 + 2^3 is the same as 2^3 + 1^3).
* **Output enhancement:** The code now shows all the pairs of cubes that sum to the target number.


This revised code is more efficient, easier to understand, and provides a more complete solution to the problem.
