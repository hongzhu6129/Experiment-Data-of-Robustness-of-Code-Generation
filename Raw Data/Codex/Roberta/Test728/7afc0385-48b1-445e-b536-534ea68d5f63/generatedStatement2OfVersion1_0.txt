Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `m` and `n` for dimensions is standard and more readable than `row` and `column` for the array size.

2. **Return an Array for Row and Column:** The `Saddleback` function now returns an `int[]` to store both the row and column index of the found element. This makes the result handling in `main` cleaner.

3. **Handling Element Not Found:**  The `Saddleback` function returns `{-1, -1}` if the element is not found.  This provides a clear way for `main` to check if the search was successful.

4. **Concise Comments:**  Added comments to explain the core logic within the `Saddleback` function.

5. **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function and how to interpret the result.

6. **Adherence to Method Signatures:** The code strictly follows the specified method signatures: `public static void main(String[])` and `private static int[] Saddleback(int[][], int, int, int)`.


This revised code is more robust, readable, and effectively implements the Saddleback search algorithm while adhering to the given constraints.
