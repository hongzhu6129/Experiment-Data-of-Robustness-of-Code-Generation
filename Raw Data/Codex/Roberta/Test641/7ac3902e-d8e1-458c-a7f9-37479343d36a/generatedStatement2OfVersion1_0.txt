Key improvements and explanations in this version:

* **JUnit Tests:**  The code now uses JUnit 5 for testing, which is the standard way to write unit tests in Java. This makes the tests much more organized and easier to run.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The test cases cover a wider range of scenarios:
    * Normal strings
    * Single-character strings.
    * One string being single-character.
    * Empty strings (corner case).
    * Null strings (corner case).
    * Strings with numbers and special characters.
    * Strings with leading/trailing spaces.
* **Clearer Exception Handling:** The `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a descriptive message to indicate the cause of the error. The `main` method demonstrates how to handle this exception.
* **No Unnecessary Comments:**  Comments are used judiciously to explain the *purpose* of the code, not what each line does (which should be self-evident).



How to run the JUnit tests:

1. **IDE:** If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can usually right-click on the test class or a specific test method and choose "Run".
2. **Command Line (with Maven):**  If you have Maven set up, navigate to the directory containing your project in the terminal and run: `mvn test`
3. **Command Line (with Gradle):** If you're using Gradle, use the command: `./gradlew test`


This improved version is more robust, easier to test, and follows better Java coding practices.
