Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays, returning 0 in both cases.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `uniqueCount` instead of just `k` makes the code more readable.

3. **Detailed Comments:** Comments explain the logic step by step.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes tests with different scenarios (duplicates, no duplicates, empty array, null array) to demonstrate the code's correctness.

5. **Output Formatting:** The output now clearly shows the length of the unique elements and the modified array (up to the `uniqueCount` index).  `Arrays.copyOfRange` ensures we only print the relevant portion of the array, not the original values after that index.  This is important because `removeDuplicates` modifies the input array in-place.


This improved version is robust, efficient, and clearly demonstrates the algorithm for removing duplicates from a sorted array while adhering to the given method signature constraints.
