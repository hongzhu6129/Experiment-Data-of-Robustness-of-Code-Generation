**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner cases and explanations of what they test:

1. **Same Point:**
   - lat1 = 25, lon1 = 35
   - lat2 = 25, lon2 = 35
   - Expected Distance: 0  (Tests if the formula handles identical points correctly)

2. **Antipodal Points (opposite sides of Earth):**
   - lat1 = 25, lon1 = 35
   - lat2 = -25, lon2 = -145  (approx. antipodal)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015 km (close to Earth's diameter; tests the formula's behavior at maximum distance)

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1 = 90, lon1 = 0   (North Pole)
   - lat2 = -90, lon2 = 0  (South Pole)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015 km (another antipodal test)

4. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1 = 0, lon1 = 0
   - lat2 = 0, lon2 = 180
   - Expected Distance: ~20015 km  (antipodal on the equator)


5. **Points with large longitude difference:**
   - lat1 = 45, lon1 = -179
   - lat2 = 45, lon2 = 179
   - Expected Distance: small value (because these points are close, crossing the 180/-180 longitude boundary) This tests if the longitude difference is handled correctly near the boundary.


6. **Points near the prime meridian:**
   - lat1 = 10, lon1 = 0.5
   - lat2 = 10, lon2 = -0.5
   - Expected Distance:  small value (tests behavior near the prime meridian)

7. **Invalid Input (optional):**  You could add checks in your program for latitudes outside -90 to +90 or longitudes outside -180 to +180.  These would throw exceptions or return error values.



How to use the test cases:

1. **Manually:** Substitute the test values into your Java code and check if the output matches the expected distance.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  Write unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit.  This is a much better approach for larger projects as it automates the testing process and makes it easier to regression test (ensure that code changes don't break existing functionality).


Example of a JUnit test (you'll need to add the JUnit library to your project):
