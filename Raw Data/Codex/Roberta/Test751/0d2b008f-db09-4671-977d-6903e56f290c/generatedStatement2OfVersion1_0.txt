**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Null and Length Check:** The `noOfTriples` method now handles `null` strings and strings shorter than 3 characters gracefully, returning 0 in those cases.  This prevents `NullPointerException` or `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. **Loop Condition:** The loop condition `i < str.length() - 2` ensures that we don't go out of bounds when checking characters `i+1` and `i+2`.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:**  More descriptive variable names (`tripleCount`, `inputString`) improve readability.

4. **Scanner Closed:**  The `Scanner` is closed in `main` to release resources.

5. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method now demonstrates how to use the `noOfTriples` method, taking user input and printing the result.
