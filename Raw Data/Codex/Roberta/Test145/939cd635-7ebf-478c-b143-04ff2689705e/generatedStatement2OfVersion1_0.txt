This comprehensive example shows how to swap or "deal" two variables in Java using several techniques:

1. **Using a Temporary Variable:** This is the most common and generally applicable method.
2. **Using Addition and Subtraction:**  A more mathematical approach that works only for numeric types.
3. **Using XOR:**  A bitwise operation method suitable for integer types. Note: this method can be slightly less readable.
4. **Swapping Strings (or other objects):**  Demonstrates that for non-primitive data types like Strings, you still need a temporary variable.  The assignment operations with Strings change the references, not the underlying string data directly.
