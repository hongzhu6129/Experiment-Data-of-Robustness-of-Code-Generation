**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner cases, to test the program thoroughly:

| Test Case | Input 1 | Input 2 | Expected Output | Notes                                       |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1        | 5       | 10      | 50             | Positive numbers                          |
| 2        | -5      | 10      | -50            | Negative and positive numbers             |
| 3        | -5      | -10     | 50             | Two negative numbers                      |
| 4        | 0       | 10      | 0              | Zero multiplied by any number is zero     |
| 5        | 10      | 0       | 0              | Any number multiplied by zero is zero     |
| 6        | 0       | 0       | 0              | Zero multiplied by zero                   |
| 7        | 1       | 1       | 1              | Identity property of multiplication          |
| **8**   | 9223372036854775807 | 1 | 9223372036854775807  | **Long.MAX_VALUE** corner case |
| **9**   | 9223372036854775807 | 2 | -2             | **Overflow** corner case:  The product exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE resulting in overflow (wraps around to a negative number) |
| **10**  | -9223372036854775808 | -1 | 9223372036854775808  | **Long.MIN_VALUE * -1**: Results in a positive number exceeding `Long.MAX_VALUE` resulting in overflow (wraps around to `Long.MIN_VALUE`). |
| **11** | 100000 | 100000 | 10000000000   | Large numbers to test potential overflow |


**How to run test cases:**

1. **Manual Testing:** You can manually enter these inputs into the console when prompted and verify the output.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  Use a testing framework like JUnit to write automated tests. This is the preferred method, especially for larger projects.  An example JUnit test would look like this:
