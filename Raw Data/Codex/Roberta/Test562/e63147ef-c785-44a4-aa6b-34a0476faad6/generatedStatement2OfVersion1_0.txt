**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input 1 | Input 2 | Expected Output | Reason/Corner Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 5 | 3 | 15 | Basic positive multiplication |
| 2 | -2 | 4 | -8 | Multiplication with a negative number |
| 3 | 0 | 10 | 0 | Multiplication with zero |
| 4 | 7 | 0 | 0 | Multiplication with zero |
| 5 | -5 | -6 | 30 | Multiplication of two negative numbers |
| 6 | 999999999 | 999999999 | 999999998000000001 | Large numbers (demonstrates why `long` is preferred over `int`) |
| 7 | Long.MAX_VALUE | 1 | 9223372036854775807 | Boundary condition (maximum long value) |
| 8 | Long.MIN_VALUE | -1 | -9223372036854775808 | Boundary condition (minimum long value times -1, be mindful of overflow potential) |
| 9 | Long.MAX_VALUE | 2 | -2 | Overflow (product exceeds `long`'s maximum value) |
| 10 | Long.MIN_VALUE | 2 | 0 | Overflow (product exceeds `long`'s minimum value) | 
| 11 | 123456789 | 987654321 | 121932631112635269 | Large number multiplication resulting in a valid long |



**How to Run Test Cases:**

While you could manually input these values, a more robust approach is to use a testing framework like JUnit. Here's a simple example of how you might use JUnit:
