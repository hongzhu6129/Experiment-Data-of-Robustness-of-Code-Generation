**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input Number | Expected Output |
|---|---|---|
| Positive Even | 10 | 10 is even. |
| Positive Odd | 7 | 7 is not even. |
| Zero | 0 | 0 is even. |  *(Corner Case)*
| Negative Even | -8 | -8 is even. |
| Negative Odd | -13 | -13 is not even. |
| Large Positive Even | 1000000 | 1000000 is even. |
| Large Negative Even | -1000000 | -1000000 is even. |
| Integer.MAX_VALUE (Odd) | 2147483647 | 2147483647 is not even. | *(Corner Case - Maximum positive int)*
| Integer.MIN_VALUE (Even) | -2147483648 | -2147483648 is even. | *(Corner Case - Minimum negative int)*



**How to run the test cases:**

1. **Manually:**  You can run the program multiple times and enter each input value manually to verify the output.

2. **Using JUnit (recommended):** Create a separate test class using a testing framework like JUnit.  This is the more robust and efficient way, especially as your program grows larger. Example using JUnit 5:
