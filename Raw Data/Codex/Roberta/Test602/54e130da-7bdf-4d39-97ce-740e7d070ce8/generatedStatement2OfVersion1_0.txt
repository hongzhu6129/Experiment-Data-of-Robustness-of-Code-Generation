Key improvements and explanations in this educational example:

* **Clearer Explanation of `headSet()`:** Emphasizes that `headSet()` provides a *view*, not a copy, and explains the implications of modifying the view.
* **Multiple Methods:** Shows different approaches: `headSet()`, looping, and streams. This helps learners understand various ways to achieve the same goal.
* **Enhanced for Loop (Method 2):**  Uses the more modern and concise enhanced `for` loop for iteration.
* **Java Streams (Method 3):** Introduces streams for more advanced learners.
* **Comments:**  Detailed comments explain each step and important concepts.
* **Formatting:**  Improved formatting for better readability.
* **Demonstration of `headSet()` Modification:** Clearly shows how modifying the view affects the original TreeSet, a crucial point to understand.
