**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` inputs, returning 0 as the length in both cases.

2. **Clearer Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` is used instead of just `i` (in a slightly different role than the loop counter) to make the purpose of the variable more obvious.

3. **In-Place Modification:**  The function modifies the original `nums` array directly (as the question seems to intend, although this might not always be the best practice in a larger project).  The unique elements are placed at the beginning of the `nums` array.

4. **Correct Length Return:** The function returns `uniqueIndex + 1` because `uniqueIndex` represents the *index* of the last unique element, and the length is always one greater than the last index.

5. **Improved `main` Method:**  The `main` method now includes more comprehensive test cases (empty array, null input) and uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant, updated portion of the array after duplicate removal. This prevents printing the "garbage" values that might remain in the array after the unique elements.


This revised version addresses the previous issues and provides a more robust and clear solution to the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array in Java.
