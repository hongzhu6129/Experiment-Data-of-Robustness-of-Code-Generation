Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:** Includes checks for `null` and empty input arrays.
* **Clearer variable names:** `k` is used to represent the index of the next unique element.
* **In-place modification:** Modifies the input array directly, as requested by the problem.
* **Comprehensive `main` method:** Demonstrates usage with various example inputs including edge cases (empty array, null array, array with no duplicates) to thoroughly test the function.
* **Informative output:** Prints the new length and the updated array (up to the new length) for better visualization.
* **Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`:** To correctly print the updated array only up to the new length, preventing printing garbage values beyond the updated section.


This revised code addresses the potential issues and offers a more robust and illustrative solution.
