This code directly prints the American flag pattern to the console using nested loops and conditional statements to control the placement of stars and stripes. It combines the star and stripe printing into a single `main` method, as requested.  The "pct" is also added as specified.  The number of `=` characters was adjusted slightly to match the example output more closely while maintaining a reasonable visual representation.
