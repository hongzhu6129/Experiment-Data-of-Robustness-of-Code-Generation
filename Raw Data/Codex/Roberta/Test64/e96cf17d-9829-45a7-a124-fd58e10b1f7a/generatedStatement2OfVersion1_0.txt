Key improvements in this version:

* **Input Validation:**  The `try-catch` block handles `DateTimeParseException` to gracefully manage invalid date inputs from the user. This prevents the program from crashing and provides helpful feedback.
* **Clear Prompts:** The `System.out.println()` statements guide the user on how to enter the dates correctly.
* **ISO 8601 Date Format:**  Uses the standard `yyyy-MM-dd` format for parsing and output, which is a widely recognized and unambiguous format.
* **`java.time` API:**  Leverages the modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8) for date and time handling. This API is significantly improved over the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes.
* **Resource Management:** The `scanner.close()` statement closes the `Scanner` to release system resources. While not strictly essential in this simple example, it's good practice.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DateDifference.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:  `javac DateDifference.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled program: `java DateDifference`


The program will then prompt you to enter the two dates.  Enter them in `yyyy-MM-dd` format.
