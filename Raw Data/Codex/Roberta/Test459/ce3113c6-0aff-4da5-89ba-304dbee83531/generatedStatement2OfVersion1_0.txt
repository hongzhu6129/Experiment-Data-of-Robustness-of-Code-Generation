Key improvements and explanations:

* **Encapsulation:**  The `length` and `width` are now private instance variables, accessed through methods.  This is better object-oriented practice.
* **JUnit Tests:** The code includes a comprehensive set of JUnit tests to demonstrate how to test the `Rectangle` class effectively.  This is *crucial* for robust code.
* **Corner Cases in Tests:** The tests cover important corner cases like zero length/width and negative length/width which help you understand how your class behaves in these situations and make it more robust.  You might decide to throw exceptions for invalid inputs like negative length/width in a real-world application.
* **Large Number Test:** The test cases also show how to test for large numbers. Handling potential `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY` results from calculations with very large numbers requires assessing your program's requirements. You may decide to throw exceptions upon detecting infinity if this situation is undesirable in your program.
* **Clearer `main` Method:** The `main` method demonstrates simple usage of the `Rectangle` class.



To run the tests (assuming you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse):

1. Make sure you have JUnit set up in your project (usually it's included by default in modern IDEs).
2. Right-click on the `RectangleTest` class and select "Run 'RectangleTest'".

To run the `main` method:

1. Right-click on the `Rectangle` class and select "Run 'Rectangle.main()'".


Using JUnit and addressing corner cases is very important for writing reliable Java code. This improved version provides a much better foundation for a `Rectangle` class.
