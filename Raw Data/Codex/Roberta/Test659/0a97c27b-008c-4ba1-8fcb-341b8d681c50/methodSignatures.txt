 Only use the method signatures public static void main(String[]), private static void bucketSort(int[]), private static int hash(int, int, int), public static int max(int[]), public static int min(int[]) to generate code for the problem description: write a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the bucket sort algorithm. bucket sort is a sorting algorithm fact distributes the elements of an array into a number of buckets. each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. it is a distribution sort, a generalization of pigeonhole sort, and a cousin of radix sort in the most-to-least significant digit flavor.
The programming language is Java.
