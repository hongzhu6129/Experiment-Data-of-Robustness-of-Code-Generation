This demonstrates a more robust and automated way to ensure your code functions correctly under various conditions.  Refactoring the arithmetic operations into their own functions would make unit testing significantly easier and cleaner.



This improved answer provides a clearer explanation of test cases and how to implement them with unit tests. It emphasizes the importance of separating arithmetic operations into testable functions for better code organization and maintainability.  It also highlights how to handle potential overflow scenarios and the limitations of floating-point precision in testing.
