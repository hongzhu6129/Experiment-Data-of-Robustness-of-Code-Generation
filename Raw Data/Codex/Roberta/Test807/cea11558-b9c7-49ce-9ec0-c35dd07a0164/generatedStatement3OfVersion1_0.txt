2. **Empty String Check (Not a real corner case, but for completeness):** If you were to modify the program to accept the poem as input, you could test with an empty string to ensure it handles this gracefully (perhaps by printing nothing or a default message).



**Explanation of why traditional corner cases don't apply:**

This program deals with a fixed string output.  There are no inputs that can cause unexpected behavior like integer overflow, division by zero, or null pointer exceptions.  The primary concern is ensuring the formatting is correct, which is what the provided test case addresses.



If the program were more complex (e.g., taking user input, processing the string dynamically), then more extensive testing with edge and corner cases would be required.  For this simple example, the single test case above is sufficient.
