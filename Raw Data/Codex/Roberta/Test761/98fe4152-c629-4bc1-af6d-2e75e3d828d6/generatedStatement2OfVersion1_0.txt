Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Naming:**  `count_nums_not_7` follows the requested signature while being descriptive.
2. **Helper Function for Digit Check:** The `containsDigit7` helper function simplifies the main logic.
3. **Efficient Digit Check:**  Uses modulo (`%`) and integer division (`/`) for an efficient digit-by-digit check.
4. **Comprehensive Main Method:**  Provides example usage with different input values to demonstrate the function.
5. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the purpose and logic of the code clearly.
6. **Robustness:** Handles edge cases (e.g., n = 0) correctly.  It will return 0 if n is 0, which is logical as there are no numbers between 1 and 0 (inclusive).
