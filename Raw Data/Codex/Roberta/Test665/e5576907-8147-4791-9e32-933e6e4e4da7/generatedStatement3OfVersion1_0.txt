4. **Large Radius:**
   - Input: `radius = 100000`
   - Expected Output (check for potential overflow issues with very large numbers, though `double` can handle very large values):
     - Perimeter: `628318.53`
     - Area: `31415926535.89793`


5. **Small Radius:**
   - Input:  `radius = 0.0001`
   - Expected Output:
     - Perimeter: `0.00`  (may round to 0 depending on formatting)
     - Area:  `0.00` (may round to 0 depending on formatting)



**How to perform the tests:**

* **Manual Testing:** You can run the program and enter these test cases manually.
* **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  A better approach is to use a testing framework like JUnit.  This allows you to write test code that automatically verifies your program's behavior against expected outputs.  This is highly recommended for more complex programs.  Here's a basic example of how you'd write a JUnit test:
