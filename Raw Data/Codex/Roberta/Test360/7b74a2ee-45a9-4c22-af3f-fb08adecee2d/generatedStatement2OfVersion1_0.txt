Key improvements and explanations:

* **Input Validation:** The code now checks for invalid month input (outside the 1-12 range) and exits gracefully with an error message if an invalid month is entered. This prevents unexpected behavior or exceptions.

* **Leap Year Handling:** The leap year calculation is more robust, correctly accounting for all leap year rules (divisible by 4, except for century years not divisible by 400).

* **Clearer Output:**  The output message is more informative, explicitly stating the number of days.

* **Scanner Closed:** The `input.close()` statement is added to release the Scanner's resources, which is good practice.
