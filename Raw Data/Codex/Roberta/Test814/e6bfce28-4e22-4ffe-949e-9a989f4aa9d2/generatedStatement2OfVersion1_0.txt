Key improvements in this version:

* **Input Validation:**  It now includes error handling for invalid date formats using a `try-catch` block.  This makes the program more robust.
* **Clearer Prompts:** The prompts to the user are more explicit about the expected date format.
* **ISO 8601 Format:** Uses the standard `yyyy-MM-dd` date format (ISO 8601), which is widely recognized and preferred for date strings.
* **`java.time` API:**  Continues to use the modern `java.time` API, which is the recommended way to handle dates and times in Java.  The `Period.between()` method directly calculates the difference.
