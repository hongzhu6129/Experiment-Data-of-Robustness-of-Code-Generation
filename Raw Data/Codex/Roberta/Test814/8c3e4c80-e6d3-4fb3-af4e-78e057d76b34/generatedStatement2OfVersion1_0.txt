Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `DateTimeParseException` if the user inputs dates in the wrong format. This makes the program more robust.
* **Clearer Prompts:**  Improved the prompts to the user to make it very clear what date format is expected.
* **`java.time` API:** Uses the modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8), which is much preferred over the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes.  It's cleaner, easier to use, and handles date/time calculations more effectively.
* **`Period` Class:** Uses the `Period` class to represent the difference between the dates, which directly gives you the difference in years, months, and days.
* **Closed Scanner:** Good practice to close the `Scanner` after use to release resources.
