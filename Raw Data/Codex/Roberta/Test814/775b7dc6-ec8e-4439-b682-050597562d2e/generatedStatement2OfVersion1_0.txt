Key improvements:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters an invalid date format.  This makes the program more robust.
* **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted more clearly, indicating what each number represents (years, months, days).
* **Standard Date/Time API:**  It uses `java.time` (introduced in Java 8), which is the modern and recommended way to work with dates and times in Java. It's much better than the old `Date` and `Calendar` classes.
* **User Input:** The program takes user input for the dates, making it more interactive.
