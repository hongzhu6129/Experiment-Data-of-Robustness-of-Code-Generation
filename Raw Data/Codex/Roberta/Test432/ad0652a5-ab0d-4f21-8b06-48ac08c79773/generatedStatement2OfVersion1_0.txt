**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Casting to int:** The simplest way to get the whole part of a `double` is to cast it to an `int`. This truncates the decimal portion.

2. **Subtraction for Rotational Part:**  Subtracting the whole part (integer) from the original `double` leaves the rotational (fractional) part.

3. **Handling Negative Numbers:**  The code now includes an example with a negative number to show that the logic works correctly in those cases as well.  Casting a negative `double` to `int` rounds towards zero (e.g., -987.654 becomes -987).

4. **Optional Formatting:**  The final example uses `printf` to show how you can format the output to a specific number of decimal places for better readability if needed.  `%.2f` formats the double to 2 decimal places, and `%d` formats the integer.  `%.3f` formats to 3 decimal places.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DoubleParts.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:  `javac DoubleParts.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code: `java DoubleParts`
