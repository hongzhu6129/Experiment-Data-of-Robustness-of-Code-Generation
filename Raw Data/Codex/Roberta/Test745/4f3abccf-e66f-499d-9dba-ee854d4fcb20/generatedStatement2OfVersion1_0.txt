This code takes two integer arrays (array1 and array2) and "metastasizes" them, meaning it interleaves their elements. It first checks if the arrays have the same length.  If they don't, it prints an error message and exits. Otherwise, it creates a new array (result) twice the size of the original arrays.  It then iterates through the original arrays, placing elements from array1 at even indices and elements from array2 at odd indices in the result array.  Finally, it prints the metastasized array.


Example Output (with the given array1 and array2):
