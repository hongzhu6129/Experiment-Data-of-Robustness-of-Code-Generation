Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles null or empty arrays:**  The code now explicitly checks for `null` and empty arrays before iterating. This prevents `NullPointerException` errors and makes the function more robust.
* **Clearer explanation and examples:** More comments and varied examples are included to illustrate the functionality and how to use the `contains10or30` method.
* **Returns immediately upon finding a match:** Once 10 or 30 is found, the function immediately returns `true`, making it slightly more efficient.
* **Maintains simplicity:** The code remains straightforward and easy to understand, fulfilling the requirement of being an educational example.
