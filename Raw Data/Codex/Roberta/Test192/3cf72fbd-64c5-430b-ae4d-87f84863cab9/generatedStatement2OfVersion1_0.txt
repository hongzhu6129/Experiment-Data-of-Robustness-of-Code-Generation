Key improvements in this code:

1. **Clearer Calculation Logic:** The logic for handling the alternating signs and denominators (including the jumps for the +1/9, + 1/17 terms etc. ), is simplified using the modulo operator.
2. **Uses 1.0:**  The code explicitly uses `1.0` in the calculations to ensure floating-point arithmetic.
3. **More Efficient:** The code iterates only the necessary number of times using a `for` loop, calculating the denominator within the loop, making it more efficient than a large, fixed `if-else` structure.
4. **Generalized `calculatePi` method:** The `calculatePi` method takes `numTerms` as a parameter, making it flexible to calculate approximations with different numbers of terms without code duplication. This demonstrates good programming practices.
5. **Informative Output:** The output clearly labels each approximation with the corresponding number of terms used.
