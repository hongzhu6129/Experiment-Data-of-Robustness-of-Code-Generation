**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Explicit Double Literals:** The code explicitly uses `1.0`, `3.0`, etc.  This ensures that the calculations are done with floating-point numbers (doubles) and avoids integer division.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** The variables `piApproximation1` and `piApproximation2` clearly indicate the number of terms used in each approximation.

3. **Informative Output:**  The `System.out.println()` statements clearly label the results, making it easy to understand the output.

4. **Correct Formula:**  The code now correctly alternates the signs in the series according to the Leibniz formula for pi.  The original prompt had some errors in the signs.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ApproximatePi.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.  Compile the code using the Java compiler:
