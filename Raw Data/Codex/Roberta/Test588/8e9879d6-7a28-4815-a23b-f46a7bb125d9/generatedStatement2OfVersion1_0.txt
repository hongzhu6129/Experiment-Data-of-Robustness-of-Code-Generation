Key improvements in this version:

* **Consistent Width:**  The "==" and the lines of "=" now have consistent widths throughout the flag, making it look more rectangular and less trapezoidal.  I adjusted the loop counts to achieve this.
* **"pct" Handling:** The code now correctly includes "pct" as requested, with adjusted spacing around it to fit within the flag pattern.
* **Clearer Structure:** The code is slightly better organized, with comments explaining the different sections of the flag.
* **Correct Number of Stripes:** Ensures the flag has the correct number of red and white stripes.


This revised version addresses the issues from the previous attempt and produces a much more accurate representation of the American flag's structure within the console's limitations.
