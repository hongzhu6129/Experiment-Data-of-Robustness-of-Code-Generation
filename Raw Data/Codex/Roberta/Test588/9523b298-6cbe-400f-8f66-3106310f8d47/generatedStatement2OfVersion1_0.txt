This revised code directly outputs the requested pattern.  The "pct" is integrated into one of the red stripes.  A more visually appealing and size-accurate flag (with correct proportions and potentially colors) would require more advanced techniques, which would significantly complicate a simple console output example. This example prioritizes the specific output pattern requested by the user within the constraints of a simple `main` method.
