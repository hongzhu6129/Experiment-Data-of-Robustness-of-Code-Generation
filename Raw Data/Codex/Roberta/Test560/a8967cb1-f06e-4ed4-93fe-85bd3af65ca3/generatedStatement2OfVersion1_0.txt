Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling (IndexOutOfBoundsException):**  The code now includes `try-catch` blocks to handle the `IndexOutOfBoundsException` that can occur if you try to remove an element from an index that doesn't exist (e.g., if the list has fewer than three elements).  This is crucial for robust code.

2. **Clearer Examples:** Separate examples for `ArrayList` (using both `remove()` and `subList()` and for arrays are provided, making it more educational.

3. **subList() explanation:** The `subList()` method is clearly explained with comments.  It's important to note that `subList()` creates a *view* of the original list, not a new list. Modifications to the sublist will affect the original list. That's why we create a *new* `ArrayList` from the sublists in the example.


4. **Array Example:** The added array example shows how to remove an element from an array, emphasizing that you need to create a *new* array because arrays are fixed-size in Java.  The `System.arraycopy()` method is the most efficient way to do this.

5. **Comments and Output:**  The code has more comments explaining each step and includes print statements to show the original and modified lists/arrays, making it easier to understand the process.
