**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StringArray.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac StringArray.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the program providing the array size as a command-line argument: `java StringArray 5`  (This will create an array of size 5).  Replace `5` with the desired size.


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes error handling for invalid input (non-integer or array sizes less than or equal to 0).  This makes the program more robust.
* **Command-line Argument:**  The array size is now taken as a command-line argument, making it more flexible.
* **String Conversion:** Uses `String.valueOf(i)` to correctly convert integers to strings.
* **Optional Printing:** The code includes a section to print the created array to the console, which can be useful for verification.  You can comment it out if you don't need to see the output.


**Example Usage:**

If you run: `java StringArray 7`

The output will be:
