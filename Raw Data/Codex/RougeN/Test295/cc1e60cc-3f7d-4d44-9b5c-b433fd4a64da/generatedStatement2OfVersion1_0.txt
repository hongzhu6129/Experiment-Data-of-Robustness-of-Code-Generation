**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **Variables:**  `int num1` and `int num2` declare variables of integer type to store the numbers.
2. **Arithmetic Operator:** The `+` operator performs addition.
3. **Assignment:** `sum = num1 + num2;` calculates the sum and assigns the result to the `sum` variable.
4. **Output:** `System.out.println()` displays the result on the console.  `System.out.printf()` provides formatted output, which is often more readable.
5. **Comments:** The comments (`// ...`) explain each step of the code, making it easier to understand.
6. **Command-Line Arguments (Optional):** The code includes an example of how to read numbers from the command line. This demonstrates a basic way to make the program more interactive.  The `try-catch` block handles potential errors if the user provides non-numeric input.

**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SumOfTwoNumbers.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type:  `javac SumOfTwoNumbers.java`
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, type: `java SumOfTwoNumbers` (or `java SumOfTwoNumbers <number1> <number2>` to use command-line input).
