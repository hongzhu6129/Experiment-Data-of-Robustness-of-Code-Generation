**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input | Expected Output |
|---|---|---|
| Positive Even | 10 | 10 is even. |
| Positive Odd | 7 | 7 is odd. |
| Zero | 0 | 0 is even. |
| Negative Even | -12 | -12 is even. |
| Negative Odd | -5 | -5 is odd. |
| Large Positive Even | 2147483646 | 2147483646 is even. |  // Close to Integer.MAX_VALUE
| Large Negative Even | -2147483648 | -2147483648 is even. | // Integer.MIN_VALUE
| Large Positive Odd | 2147483647 | 2147483647 is odd. |   // Integer.MAX_VALUE
| Large Negative Odd | -2147483647 | -2147483647 is odd. | // Close to Integer.MIN_VALUE
| Invalid Input (String) | hello | Invalid input. Please enter an integer. (Prompts for re-entry) |
| Invalid Input (Floating Point) | 3.14 | Invalid input. Please enter an integer. (Prompts for re-entry) |



**Explanation of Corner Cases:**

* **Zero:**  Zero is considered an even number mathematically, so the program should correctly identify it as such.
* **Integer.MIN_VALUE and Integer.MAX_VALUE:** Testing these limits ensures that the program handles the largest and smallest possible integer values correctly.  `Integer.MIN_VALUE` is particularly important because its absolute value is one greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
* **Invalid Input:** The program includes input validation to handle cases where the user enters non-integer values.  This prevents the program from crashing due to `InputMismatchException`.

**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. **Manually:** You can run the program multiple times, entering each test case input manually and verifying the output.

2. **Using a Testing Framework (Recommended):**  For more efficient and automated testing, use a testing framework like JUnit. Here's a basic example using JUnit:
