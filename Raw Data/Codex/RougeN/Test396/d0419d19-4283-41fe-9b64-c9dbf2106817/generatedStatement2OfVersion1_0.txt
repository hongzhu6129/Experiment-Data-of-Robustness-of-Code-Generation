**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **TekelecComparator Class:**  The crucial part is the `TekelecComparator` class which implements the `Comparator<String>` interface. This allows us to define custom sorting logic.

2. **compare Method:**  The `compare(String s1, String s2)` method within `TekelecComparator` is where you implement the specific Tekelec sorting rules.  The provided example demonstrates sorting even digits before odd digits.  You'll need to replace this with the *actual* Tekelec sorting algorithm you need to use (as it's not standard and implementation-dependent).

3. **TreeMap Construction:** The `TreeMap` is constructed with an instance of `TekelecComparator`:
