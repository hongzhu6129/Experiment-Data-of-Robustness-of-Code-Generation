Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  It explicitly checks for `null` or empty input arrays.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `j`.
- **In-place modification:**  The array is modified directly, as requested.
- **Comprehensive testing:** The `main` method includes more test cases, including empty and null array scenarios, demonstrating robustness.
- **Output formatting:** The output now clearly shows both the new length and the contents of the modified array (up to the new length), making it easier to understand the results.
- **Conciseness and Readability:** The code is more concise and easier to follow while adhering to the required method signatures.
