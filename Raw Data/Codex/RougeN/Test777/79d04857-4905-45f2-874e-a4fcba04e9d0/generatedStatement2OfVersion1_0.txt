**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **File Handling:** The code now reads the file content using `Files.readAllLines()`, which is more efficient than reading line by line for larger files.  It handles `IOException` gracefully.  You'll need to create a file named `input.txt` in the same directory as your Java file, or change the `filePath` variable.
2. **Word Cleaning:**  It removes punctuation and converts words to lowercase using `replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z]", "").toLowerCase()`. This ensures that "word." and "Word" are considered the same, and punctuation doesn't affect length.
3. **Multiple Longest Words:**  It now correctly handles cases where multiple words have the same maximum length.  It stores them in a `List<String>` and returns them all, comma-separated.
4. **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block catches `IOException` and returns an empty string if there's an error reading the file. This prevents the program from crashing.
5. **Clearer Variable Names:** More descriptive variable names like `longestWords` and `maxLength` improve readability.
6. **Whitespace Handling:** Splits words based on whitespace using `\\s+` which handles multiple spaces correctly.



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `LongestWordFinder.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile: `javac LongestWordFinder.java`
3. **Run:** `java LongestWordFinder`


This improved version is more robust, handles various edge cases, and provides a clearer and more efficient solution to finding the longest word(s) in a text file.  Remember to create your `input.txt` file with some text.
