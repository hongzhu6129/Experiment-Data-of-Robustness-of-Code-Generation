This revised code addresses the original prompt more accurately by:

1. **Clearer Problem Definition:**  The prompt mentions "exceeds depth". I interpret this as finding the *maximum* depth of the binary tree, which is a standard tree problem.
2. **Node Class:** Includes a `Node` class to represent the nodes of the binary tree.  This was missing in the previous response.
3. **Recursive `maxDepth` Method:**  Implements a recursive solution to find the maximum depth.  The base case is when the node is null (depth 0).  The recursive step calculates the depth of the left and right subtrees and returns the larger depth plus 1 (for the current node).
4. **Example Usage in `main`:** Creates a sample binary tree and calls the `maxDepth` method to demonstrate how to use it. I added one more level to demonstrate the code handles greater depths correctly.
5. **Corrected Output:**  The `println` statement now correctly prints the "Height of tree" (which is the maximum depth).


This improved answer provides a complete, runnable Java program to find the maximum depth (or "exceeds depth") of a binary tree.
