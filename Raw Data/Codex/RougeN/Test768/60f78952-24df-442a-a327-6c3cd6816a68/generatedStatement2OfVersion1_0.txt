Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles Invalid Input:** Checks if `k` is valid (not negative or greater than array length) and prints a message if it's invalid.
* **Two Methods Demonstrated:** Includes both the Min-Heap (Priority Queue) method (more efficient for larger datasets when k is relatively small) and the sorting method (simpler, suitable when k is a larger portion of the array size or if simplicity is preferred).
* **Clearer Output:**  The output now clearly labels which method was used to generate the result.
* **Concise Conversion to Array:** Uses `toArray()` with a type parameter to efficiently convert the PriorityQueue to an Integer array.  This is cleaner than manually iterating.
* **Example Usages:**  Includes a couple of example usages in `main` to demonstrate the function.


**Explanation of the Min-Heap Method:**

1. **Min-Heap:** A Min-Heap data structure (implemented using `PriorityQueue` in Java) keeps track of the smallest element at the top.
2. **Iterate and Offer:**  We iterate through the input array `arr`. In each iteration, we offer the current element `num` to the `minHeap`.
3. **Maintain Size k:** If the size of the `minHeap` becomes greater than `k`, we remove the smallest element (the root) using `minHeap.poll()`. This ensures that the `minHeap` always contains the `k` largest elements seen so far.
4. **Final Result:** After iterating through the entire array, the `minHeap` will contain the `k` largest elements. We can then extract these elements into an array.


**Time Complexity:**

* **Min-Heap Method:** O(n log k), where n is the size of the input array.  More efficient when k is relatively small.
* **Sorting Method:** O(n log n) because of the sorting. Can be more efficient if k is a large percentage of n.
