This code addresses the prompt directly by:

1. **Using `public static void main(String[] args)`:**  The code adheres to the required method signature.
2. **Finding file size:**  It uses `file.length()` to get the file size in bytes.
3. **Handling file existence:**  It checks if the file exists using `file.exists()` to prevent errors if a file isn't found.  It prints a message if the file doesn't exist.
4. **Providing specified file paths:** The code includes an array of file paths to check. You should replace `/home/students/abc.txt` and `/home/students/test.txt` with the actual file paths you want to use.  If you want the user to provide the paths, you'll need to modify the code slightly to take command-line arguments, as `main`'s signature does not allow for `Scanner` based input directly.


**Example with command-line arguments (if you need user input):**
