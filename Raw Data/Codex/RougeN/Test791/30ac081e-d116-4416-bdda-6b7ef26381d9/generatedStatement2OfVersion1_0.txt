Explanation:

1. **TreeMap:** We use a `TreeMap` because it's a sorted map implementation.  This ensures that the keys are ordered, making the reverse view meaningful.  If you have an unsorted map (like `HashMap`), the order of elements is not guaranteed, and a "reverse" view wouldn't be consistent.

2. **descendingMap():** The `descendingMap()` method of `TreeMap` returns a *view* of the map with the keys in descending order. Importantly, changes to the original map are reflected in the reverse view, and vice versa (because it's a view, not a copy).

3. **descendingKeySet():** If you only need the keys in reverse order (and not the entire map entries), you can use the `descendingKeySet()` method, which returns a `NavigableSet` of the keys in descending order.

4. **Casting:** We need to cast our `Map` to `TreeMap` because `descendingMap()` and `descendingKeySet()` are methods specific to `TreeMap` and not available in the general `Map` interface.


Important Note: If you have a `HashMap` (or another unsorted `Map`) and you need a reversed *sorted* view, you can first copy the entries into a `TreeMap` and then use `descendingMap()` or `descendingKeySet()`.
