JUnit version 4.13
.Original array: [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]
3th smallest element: 7
3th largest element: 10

Demonstrating (without full implementation) manual calculation (more efficient than fully sorting):
For Kth Smallest (using a Max Heap - only showing concept):
1. Build a Max Heap of the first k elements of the array.
2. Iterate through the rest of the array. For each element:
   - If the element is smaller than the root of the heap (largest in heap so far):
     - Replace the root with the element and heapify.
3. After iterating through the whole array, the root of the heap is the kth smallest element.

For Kth Largest (using a Min Heap - only showing concept):
1. Build a Min Heap of the first k elements of the array.
2. Iterate through the rest of the array. For each element:
   - If the element is larger than the root of the heap (smallest in heap so far):
     - Replace the root with the element and heapify.
3. After iterating through the whole array, the root of the heap is the kth largest element.
