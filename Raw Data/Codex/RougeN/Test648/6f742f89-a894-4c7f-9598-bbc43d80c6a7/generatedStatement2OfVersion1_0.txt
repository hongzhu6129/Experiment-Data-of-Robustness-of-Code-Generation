Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Clearer Test Cases:** The code now includes comments to clearly label each test case and what it's testing.

2. **Corner Cases:**
   - Negative numbers are tested.
   - Zero and a non-zero number are tested.
   - Large numbers (close to integer limits) are included to illustrate potential overflow issues with the addition/subtraction method.

3. **Overflow Handling (Test Case 4):** The test case using `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` is now using `long` variables to demonstrate how to handle potential overflow if you were dealing with very large numbers where the sum/difference might exceed the `int` capacity.

4. **Alternative Swap Method (Test Case 5):**  The code now demonstrates a more robust swap method using a temporary variable. This avoids the overflow issue entirely. The temporary variable approach is generally preferred.


Key takeaway: While the addition/subtraction method is clever, it has the potential for overflow. The temporary variable method is safer and easier to understand.  Use the temporary variable approach in real-world code.
