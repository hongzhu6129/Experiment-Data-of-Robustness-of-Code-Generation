Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  Improved variable names and added comments make the code easier to understand.
* **`java.time` API:** Uses the modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8) which is much preferred over older, clunkier date/time classes.
* **`Period.ofYears()`:** Uses `Period.ofYears()` for clarity and correctness when adding/subtracting years. This handles leap years correctly.
* **Direct Comparisons:**  Uses `isBefore()` and `isAfter()` methods for date comparisons, which is cleaner than using `compareTo()`.
* **Output Formatting:**  Provides more descriptive output to clearly show the results of the comparisons.
