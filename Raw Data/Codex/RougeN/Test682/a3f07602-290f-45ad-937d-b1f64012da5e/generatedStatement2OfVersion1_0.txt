Explanation:

1. **Input String:** The code takes a string `originalString` as input. You can change this to test with different strings.
2. **Length Check:**  It checks if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, it prints an error message and exits.
3. **Extract Last 3 Characters:**  `originalString.substring(originalString.length() - 3)` extracts the last three characters of the string.  The `substring()` method takes the starting index (inclusive) as an argument. We calculate the starting index by subtracting 3 from the string's length.
4. **Repeat the Substring:** `lastThreeChars.repeat(4)` creates a new string by repeating the extracted substring 4 times.  The `repeat()` method was introduced in Java 11. If you are using an older version, you can use a loop or `StringUtils.repeat()` from Apache Commons Lang.
5. **Output:**  The code prints the resulting repeated string to the console.
6. **Helper function (testAndPrint):** This function is created to demonstrate how you can easily test with multiple input strings without repeating the main logic.  It makes the code more organized and reusable.
