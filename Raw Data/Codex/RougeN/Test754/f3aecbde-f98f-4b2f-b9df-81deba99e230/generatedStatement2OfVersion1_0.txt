Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Consecutive Operators:** The `validate` method now checks for consecutive operators (like `++`, `//`, etc.) using a regular expression, making it more robust.  It allows for combined +/-, as those can be valid (e.g. `2 + -3`).
2. **Parentheses Balancing:**  The `areParenthesesBalanced` helper function now ensures that parentheses are correctly balanced. This prevents false positives for expressions like "2 + 3)".
3. **Clearer Regular Expression:** The regular expression `^[0-9a-zA-Z+\\-*/(). ]+$` is used to match valid characters in a mathematical expression. It covers numbers, letters (for variables), basic operators, parentheses, and spaces.  It's still a basic regex and doesn't handle more complex math functions, but it's a good starting point.
4. **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use `validate` with different example expressions, showcasing both valid and invalid cases, including the new checks for consecutive operators and parenthesis balance.


This improved version addresses more potential issues and is a more comprehensive solution for basic mathematical expression validation.  You can extend it further to handle more complex mathematical constructs or stricter validation rules as needed.
