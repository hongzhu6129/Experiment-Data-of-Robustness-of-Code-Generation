Key Improvements:

* **Handles Overlapping Matches:**  The previous solution didn't count overlapping matches correctly.  This version uses regular expressions (specifically `".{3}"` and `".{4}"`) with a `Matcher` to find all possible overlapping substrings of length 3 and 4.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** The code explicitly handles `null` and empty string inputs, ensuring that the function doesn't throw exceptions and returns a reasonable value (true, as there are zero occurrences of both lengths).
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `count3` and `count4` is more descriptive.
* **More Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes several test cases, including edge cases and examples with overlapping matches, demonstrating the correctness of the solution.
* **Efficiency:** Using regex is generally an efficient way to find patterns in strings, especially when dealing with overlapping occurrences.


Explanation of Regular Expression:

* `".{3}"`: The `.` (dot) matches any character (except newline).  The `{3}` quantifier means "exactly 3 occurrences of the preceding element." So, `".{3}"` matches any sequence of exactly 3 characters.
* `".{4}"`: Similar to above, this matches any sequence of exactly 4 characters.
