The original error "invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'euclidean'" likely occurred because you were trying to convert the string "euclidean" (perhaps a program name or some other text) to an integer.  The provided code addresses this in several ways:

1. **Clear Usage Message:** The `main` method now checks if exactly two arguments are provided.  If not, it prints a helpful usage message explaining how to run the program.

2. **Error Handling with try-catch:** The `Integer.parseInt()` calls are wrapped in a `try-catch` block.  If the user enters non-numeric input, a `NumberFormatException` will be caught, and a clear error message will be printed to the console instead of crashing the program.

3. **Focus on Euclid Algorithm:** The code concentrates on the core functionality of the Euclidean algorithm, taking two integer inputs and calculating their GCD.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `EuclideanAlgorithm.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then compile using:
