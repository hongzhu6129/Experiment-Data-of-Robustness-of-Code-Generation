**Test Cases:**

While this program doesn't take any input, we can still consider testing in a broader sense.  Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Visual Inspection:**  The primary test is to run the program and visually verify that the output matches the intended face.  This is often the most practical approach for simple output-based programs.

2. **Output Redirection (for automated testing):**  We can redirect the output to a file and compare it against an expected output file.  This allows for automated testing.
