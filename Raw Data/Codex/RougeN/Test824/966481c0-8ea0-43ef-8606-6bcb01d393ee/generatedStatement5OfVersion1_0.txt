This JUnit test captures the program's output and compares it to the expected string.  It's a more robust approach for larger projects.  The `\r\n` in `expectedOutput` accounts for Windows line endings. Adjust to `\n` if you are on Linux/macOS.  Always restore `System.out` after redirecting it in tests.


The "corner cases" for this particular program are primarily related to output handling and character encoding, rather than complex input validation.  The provided tests address those concerns.
