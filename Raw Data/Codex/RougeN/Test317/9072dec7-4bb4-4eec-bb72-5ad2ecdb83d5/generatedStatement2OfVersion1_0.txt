Key improvements in this version:

* **Efficiency:**  The recommended approach is now using `toArray(T[] a)` with a pre-allocated array. This is more efficient as it avoids creating unnecessary intermediate objects and copying.
* **Clarity:** Added more comments to explain different approaches and their efficiency implications.
* **Casting Safety:** Explicitly casts to `Integer` after using the non-generic `toArray()` to handle potential `ClassCastException`.
* **Demonstrating Polling:** Shows how to retrieve elements in priority order using `poll()`.  A copy of the PriorityQueue is used to avoid modifying the original.
* **Comprehensive Examples:** Provides multiple methods to convert, highlighting the best practice.
