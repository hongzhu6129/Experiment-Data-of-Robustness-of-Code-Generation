**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Handles Zero:**  The code explicitly checks for `n == 0` and returns "0" to avoid an empty string in that case.
* **StringBuilder for Efficiency:** Using `StringBuilder` is much more efficient than repeated string concatenation, especially for larger numbers. The `insert(0, remainder)` inserts at the beginning of the string, building the binary representation correctly from right to left.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The test cases cover zero, positive numbers (including a large positive and a power of 2), negative numbers (demonstrating correct two's complement representation), `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, and 1.  These cover the typical corner cases and some standard values.
* **JUnit 5:** The tests are now written using JUnit 5, which is the most current and recommended version.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed in the `main` method to release resources.


To run the tests, you will need to have a testing framework like JUnit 5 set up in your project.  Most IDEs (like IntelliJ or Eclipse) provide integrated support for running JUnit tests.  You can also run them from the command line using build tools like Maven or Gradle.
