Key improvements in this educational example:

* **Clearer explanations:** Comments are added to guide the learner through the code and explain the methods used.
* **Two common search methods:** Demonstrates both `containsKey()` and `get()`.  Highlights that `get()` is usually preferred as it retrieves the value directly.
* **Illustrative examples:**  Uses meaningful sample data (student names and scores) to make the example more relatable.
* **Handles nulls correctly:**  Shows how to handle the `null` return from `get()` to avoid `NullPointerException`.
* **Range searching:**  Shows how to exploit TreeMap's sorted nature for efficient range queries (a key advantage of TreeMaps).
* **More concise and readable:** Improved formatting and variable names.
