To compile and run this:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ListFilesAndDirectories.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:  `javac ListFilesAndDirectories.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code, providing the directory path as a command-line argument: `java ListFilesAndDirectories /path/to/your/directory`  (Replace `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual path).


Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:** It now handles cases where the directory doesn't exist or the provided path isn't a directory.
* **Null Check:** It checks for a `null` return from `directory.list()` to prevent `NullPointerExceptions` if there's an issue accessing the directory contents (e.g., permissions issues).
* **Clearer Output:**  Improved output messages to indicate the directory being listed and to handle errors.
* **Sorting:**  Added `Arrays.sort()` to sort the list of files and directories alphabetically for consistent output. (This is optional but helpful).
* **Command-line Argument:** The directory path is now taken as a command-line argument, making the code more flexible.
* **Comments:** Added more comments to explain the code's logic.
