Key improvements and explanations:

1. **ArrayList (Dynamic Sizing):** The preferred way is to use an `ArrayList` to store the lines.  `ArrayList` grows automatically as you add lines, so you don't need to know the number of lines beforehand.  You can then easily convert the `ArrayList` to a regular array using `toArray()` if necessary.

2. **Fixed-Size Array (Less Flexible):**  If you absolutely *must* use a fixed-size array directly, you need to specify its size.  This approach is less flexible because:
   - You might waste memory if the file has fewer lines than the array size.
   - You might lose data if the file has *more* lines than the array size (the example code now handles this by only reading up to `maxSize` and then resizing the array using `Arrays.copyOf()`).

3. **Error Handling:** The code includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that can occur when reading files. This prevents the program from crashing and provides a user-friendly error message.

4. **Resource Management (try-with-resources):** The `BufferedReader` is enclosed in a `try-with-resources` statement. This ensures that the reader is automatically closed, even if an exception occurs. This is important for preventing resource leaks.

5. **Clearer Comments and Explanations:**  The code has more comments to explain the different parts and the trade-offs between using an `ArrayList` and a fixed-size array.


How to use:

1. **Create a text file** named `your_file.txt` (or whatever you want to call it) in the same directory as your Java program, or provide the full path to the file.
2. **Put some text** in the file, each line on a separate row.
3. **Compile and run** the Java code.  The program will print the contents of the file, stored in an array, to the console.
