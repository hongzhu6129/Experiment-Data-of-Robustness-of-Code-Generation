**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays without throwing exceptions.  It returns 0 in these cases.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** The variable `k` (instead of `i` in some solutions) more clearly represents the index for the *unique* elements.

3. **In-place Modification:**  The `removeDuplicates` function modifies the original array `nums` directly. It overwrites the duplicate elements with the unique ones and returns the length of the updated section.

4. **Illustrative `main` Method:** The `main` method now includes multiple test cases, including edge cases and demonstrates how to print the updated array using `Arrays.copyOfRange`. This is crucial because the original array might still contain the original elements after the unique length portion.  `Arrays.copyOfRange` ensures you only print the relevant, updated part.


5. **Efficiency:** The algorithm is efficient.  It traverses the array only once (O(n) time complexity) and doesn't use extra space other than a few variables (O(1) space complexity).


This version is more robust, clear, and demonstrates the correct way to handle the results.
