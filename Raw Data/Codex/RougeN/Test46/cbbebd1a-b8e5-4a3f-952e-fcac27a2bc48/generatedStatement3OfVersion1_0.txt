This revised answer addresses important considerations like:

* **Input Validation:** While not explicitly implemented here (for simplicity in the core average calculation), production code should ideally validate user input (e.g., check for non-numeric input).
* **Closing the Scanner:** The `scanner.close()` line is now included to release the resource.
* **Floating-Point Division:** Explicitly using `3.0` ensures more accurate average calculation.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  Includes corner cases and an explanation of potential overflow if integer division were used.
* **JUnit Example:** Shows how to start testing with a testing framework.
