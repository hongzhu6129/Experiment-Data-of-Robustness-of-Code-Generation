Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles `NumberFormatException`:** The `main` method now includes a `try-catch` block to specifically catch the `NumberFormatException`.  This addresses the original error prompt, which indicated a problem with converting a non-numeric string ("computer") to an integer. Now, if the input string is not a valid integer, a helpful error message is printed.

2. **Clearer error message:** The error message in the `catch` block is more user-friendly, explaining that the input should be a valid integer.

3. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `sort` methods, including an example with a different base (base 8).  This helps to illustrate the functionality of the provided code.

4. **`sort(int[], int base)` method:**  Added an overloaded `sort` method that takes a `base` argument, allowing the radix sort to work with bases other than 10.

5. **`countingSortByDigit` improvements:** This core method is now more efficient and clearer. The `System.arraycopy` is used for faster copying of the sorted elements back to the original array.

6. **Comments and Documentation:** Added comments to explain the purpose of different parts of the code, making it more readable and understandable.


This revised version addresses the error, provides better error handling, and offers a more complete and robust implementation of radix sort.
