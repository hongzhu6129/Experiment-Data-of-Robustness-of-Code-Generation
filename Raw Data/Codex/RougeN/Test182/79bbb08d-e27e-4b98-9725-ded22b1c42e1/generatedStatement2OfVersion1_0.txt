Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays and null inputs.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` makes the purpose of the variable more obvious.
- **Comprehensive testing in `main`:**  Includes tests for various scenarios (empty array, null input, single element array) which is good practice.
- **Output formatting:** Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant part of the modified array, avoiding displaying the unchanged elements beyond the new length.  This makes the output much cleaner and easier to understand.
