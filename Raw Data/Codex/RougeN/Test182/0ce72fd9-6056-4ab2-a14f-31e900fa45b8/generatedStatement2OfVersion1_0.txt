Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays and `null` input.
* **Clearer variable naming:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive.
* **Comprehensive test cases:** The `main` method includes more test cases, including edge cases and a case with no duplicates, to demonstrate the correctness of the code.
* **Output formatting:** The output is now formatted to clearly show both the updated length and the modified array (up to the new length).
* **Efficiency:**  The algorithm itself is efficient, operating in O(n) time and O(1) space. It modifies the array in-place.



This revised solution is more robust and clearly demonstrates the functionality according to the problem description.
