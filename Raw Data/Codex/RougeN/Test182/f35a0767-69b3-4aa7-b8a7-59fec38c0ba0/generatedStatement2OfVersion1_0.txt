Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Includes explicit checks for `null` and empty input arrays to prevent `NullPointerException` and other issues.
* **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `j`.
* **Comprehensive `main` method:** Demonstrates usage with multiple test cases, including edge cases like empty and null arrays.
* **Output formatting:** Uses `Arrays.toString` and `Arrays.copyOfRange` in the main method to neatly display the updated array contents after duplicate removal. This makes it easier to verify the results.


This revised code is robust, efficient, and clearly demonstrates the functionality of `removeDuplicates`.
