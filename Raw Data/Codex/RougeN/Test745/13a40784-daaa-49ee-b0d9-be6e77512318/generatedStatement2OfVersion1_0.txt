Explanation:

1. **`roundFloat(float number, int decimalPlaces)` method:**
   - Takes the `float` number and the desired number of `decimalPlaces` as input.
   - Calculates `powerOfTen` (e.g., 100 for 2 decimal places).
   - Multiplies the `number` by `powerOfTen` to shift the decimal point.
   - Uses `Math.round()` to round to the nearest integer.
   - Divides the result by `powerOfTen` to shift the decimal point back to its original position.
   - Returns the rounded `float` value.


2. **`main` method (examples):**
   - Shows how to use the `roundFloat` method with different float values and decimal places.
   - **Important:** The example also demonstrates the inherent limitations of `float` precision.  Floats are represented in binary and cannot precisely represent all decimal values.  This can lead to slight inaccuracies in rounding.



3. **Using BigDecimal (for accurate rounding):**
   - The code now includes an example using `BigDecimal` for more accurate rounding.  `BigDecimal` is recommended when precision is critical, especially in financial or scientific calculations.
   - Notice how the `BigDecimal` is created using a `String` constructor.  This is important to avoid introducing inaccuracies from the start.  If you create a `BigDecimal` from a `double` or `float`, the initial inaccuracies of those types will be carried over.


Key improvements in this version:

- Clearer examples in `main` demonstrating usage.
- Explanation of `float` precision limitations.
- Example using `BigDecimal` for accurate rounding when needed.  This is best practice for situations where precision is paramount.
