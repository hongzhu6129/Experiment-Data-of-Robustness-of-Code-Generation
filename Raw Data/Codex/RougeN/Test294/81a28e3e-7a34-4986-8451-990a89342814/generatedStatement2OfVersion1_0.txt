Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Formatting:** Uses tabs (`\t`) for alignment, making the output much more readable.  Includes the Zone ID itself.
* **Correct +0500 Representation:** Uses `ZoneId.of("+05:00")` (or `ZoneOffset.of("+05:00")`) to ensure the +0500 offset is handled correctly.  The previous version's attempt to format using `Z` after manually adjusting wouldn't have consistently given +0500.
* **Efficiency:**  `ZonedDateTime.now(zone)` is called only once per zone and then the `withZoneSameInstant()` method is used, avoiding unnecessary repeated calls.
* **Standard DateTimeFormatter:** Using `DateTimeFormatter` is the recommended way to format dates and times in modern Java, providing flexibility and better control.


This code now accurately displays the current time in both UTC and +0500 for every available time zone, with a clean and easy-to-understand output format.
