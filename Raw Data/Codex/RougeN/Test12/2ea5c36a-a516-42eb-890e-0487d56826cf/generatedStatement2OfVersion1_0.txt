Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Node Class:**  A `Node` class is defined to represent the nodes of the binary tree. It stores the data and references to the left and right children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):**  This recursive method calculates the maximum depth (or height) of the binary tree.
   - **Base Case:** If the `node` is `null` (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  It recursively calls `maxDepth` on the left and right subtrees. It then returns the maximum of the left and right subtree depths, plus 1 (to account for the current node).

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - A sample binary tree is created.
   - The `maxDepth` method is called with the root node to calculate the maximum depth.
   - The result is printed to the console.


Key Improvements over Simpler Solutions:

- **Handles Null Nodes:** The code explicitly checks for `null` nodes, making it robust and preventing `NullPointerExceptions`.
- **Clearer Recursive Logic:** The use of `Math.max` makes the code more concise and easier to understand.
- **Illustrative Example in `main`:** The `main` method provides a clear example of how to use the `maxDepth` method and how to construct a binary tree.
- **Conciseness:** The code avoids unnecessary variables and calculations, resulting in a more efficient solution.
