This code demonstrates:

1. **Creating a PriorityQueue:**  Shows how to initialize a PriorityQueue with a specific data type (Integer in the first example).
2. **Adding elements:**  Uses the `add()` method to populate the PriorityQueue.
3. **Getting the size:** Uses the `size()` method to get the number of elements in the PriorityQueue.
4. **Printing the size:** Demonstrates outputting the size to the console.
5. **Dynamic size changes:** Shows how adding and removing elements (using `add()` and `poll()`) affects the size.
6. **Different Data Types:**  Provides an example with Strings to illustrate that PriorityQueues can hold various data types.
7. **Empty PriorityQueue:** Shows that `size()` correctly returns 0 for an empty PriorityQueue.


This comprehensive example within a single `main` method provides a clear and concise educational demonstration of how to count elements in a Java PriorityQueue.
