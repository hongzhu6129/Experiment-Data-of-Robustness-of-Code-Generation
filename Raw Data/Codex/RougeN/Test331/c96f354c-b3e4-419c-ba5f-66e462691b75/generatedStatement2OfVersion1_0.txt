**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Normal Case:**
   - Input: 10, 20, 30
   - Expected Output: 20.0

2. **Negative Numbers:**
   - Input: -5, -10, -15
   - Expected Output: -10.0

3. **Zeroes:**
   - Input: 0, 0, 0
   - Expected Output: 0.0

4. **Mixed Positive and Negative:**
   - Input: -5, 10, 5
   - Expected Output: 3.3333333333333335  (or similar, due to floating-point representation)

5. **Large Numbers:**
   - Input: 1000000, 2000000, 3000000
   - Expected Output: 2000000.0

6. **Decimal Numbers:**
   - Input: 2.5, 5.7, 8.2
   - Expected Output: 5.466666666666667 (or similar)

7. **Corner Case: Very Large Numbers (potential overflow with integers, but should work with doubles):**
    - Input: Double.MAX_VALUE, Double.MAX_VALUE / 2, Double.MAX_VALUE / 4
    - Expected Output:  A very large number (approximately 1.2E308).  Be aware that calculations close to the limits of `double` can have reduced precision.

8.  **Corner Case: Very Small Numbers (close to zero):**
    - Input: 0.0000001, 0.0000002, 0.0000003
    - Expected Output: 2.0E-7 (or similar)



**How to run the test cases:**

1. **Manually:** You can run the program multiple times, entering each set of input values.  Compare the output with the expected output.

2. **Using JUnit (or other testing framework):**  For more robust testing, it's highly recommended to use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a simple JUnit example (you'll need to add JUnit to your project):
