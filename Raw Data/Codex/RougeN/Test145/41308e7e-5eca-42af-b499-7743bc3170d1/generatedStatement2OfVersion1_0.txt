**Test Cases:**

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 5 | 10 | 50 | Basic positive numbers |
| 2 | -3 | 7 | -21 | One negative number |
| 3 | -5 | -8 | 40 | Two negative numbers |
| 4 | 0 | 12 | 0 | Multiplication by zero |
| 5 | 15 | 0 | 0 | Multiplication by zero |
| 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Both numbers are zero |
| 7 | 9223372036854775807 | 1 | 9223372036854775807 |  Largest positive long, testing for overflow (if using int, this would overflow)|
| 8| 9223372036854775807 | 2 | -2 |  Overflow with long (if using int, this would also overflow) |
| 9 | -9223372036854775808 | -1 | -9223372036854775808 | Smallest negative long, testing for overflow (if using int, this would overflow) |
| 10 | -9223372036854775808 | 2 | 0 | Overflow with long (if using int, this would also overflow) |
| 11 | 123456789 | 987654321 | 121932631112635269 | Large positive numbers to check for potential overflow if int was used. |


**How to run the test cases:**

1. **Manual Testing:**  You can manually enter these values into the console when prompted by the program.

2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):** For more robust testing, use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a simple JUnit example:
