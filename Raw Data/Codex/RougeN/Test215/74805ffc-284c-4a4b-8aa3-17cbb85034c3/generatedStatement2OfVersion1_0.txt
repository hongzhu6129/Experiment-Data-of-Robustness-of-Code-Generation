Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Explanations:** Comments explain each step, making the educational aspect stronger.
* **Two Methods:**  Demonstrates two different approaches to extracting whole and fractional parts.  The modulo operator method (%) can sometimes be less intuitive, so including both helps learners see alternatives.
* **Negative Number Handling:** Added a section specifically demonstrating how to handle negative doubles correctly, as this can be a common source of errors.  `Math.floor()` is essential for negative numbers.
* **Conciseness and Readability:** The code is organized and easy to follow.
* **Output Formatting:** The output is well-formatted to enhance understanding.


This improved version is more robust, educational, and handles potential edge cases better, fulfilling the requirements of the prompt more effectively.
