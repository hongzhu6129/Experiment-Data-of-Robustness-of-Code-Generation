**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Positive Number:**
   - Input: `7`
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 7 up to 11.

2. **Zero:**
   - Input: `0`
   - Expected Output:  All results will be 0.

3. **Negative Number:**
   - Input: `-5`
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of -5 (negative results).

4. **Large Positive Number:**
   - Input: `10000` 
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 10000. Checks for potential integer overflow issues (though Java's `int` can handle this size).

5. **Large Negative Number:**
   - Input: `-10000`
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of -10000.


**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You can manually run the test cases by compiling and running the Java code, entering the input values one at a time.  

For more automated testing, consider using a testing framework like JUnit:
