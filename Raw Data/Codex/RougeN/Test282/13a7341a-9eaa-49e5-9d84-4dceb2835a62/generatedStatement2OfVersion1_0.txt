**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Data Type:**  Fermat numbers grow very quickly.  Using `int` would lead to overflow very early.  We use `long` to accommodate larger values. However, even `long` will not be sufficient for all 10 Fermat numbers.  Fermat numbers beyond the 5th quickly exceed the capacity of primitive data types in Java.

2. **Efficiency:** We calculate 2<sup>2<sup>n</sup></sup> using `Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, n))`. While functionally correct, this is not the most efficient way because `Math.pow()` works with doubles and can introduce some imprecision for very large numbers.

3. **Handling Overflow:**  The provided code doesn't explicitly handle overflow, which will occur for larger values of `n`.  While it doesn't crash, the results will be incorrect after overflow happens.

**Version with BigInteger (Handles Large Numbers Correctly):**

If you want to calculate Fermat numbers accurately beyond what `long` can handle, you need to use `BigInteger`:
