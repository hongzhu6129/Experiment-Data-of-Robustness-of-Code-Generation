This code adheres to the specified method signatures: `public int maxDepth(Node)` and `public static void main(String[])`. It accurately calculates the maximum depth (height) of a binary tree using recursion.  The `main` method demonstrates its use with a couple of example trees.  Importantly, it handles the base case of an empty tree (null node) correctly by returning 0.
