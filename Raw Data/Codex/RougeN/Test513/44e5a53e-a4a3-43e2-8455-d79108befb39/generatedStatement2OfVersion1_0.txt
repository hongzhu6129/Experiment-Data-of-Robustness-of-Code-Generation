Key Improvements:

1. **Handles Empty Tree:** The code now gracefully handles the case where the tree is empty. It returns `null` and prints an appropriate message.

2. **Handles Single-Node Tree:** The code correctly handles the case where the tree has only one node (the root). The `removeRoot` helper function takes care of removing the root node. It returns null because we are deleting the only element in the tree.

3. **Clearer Logic:**  The logic for finding and removing the last element is simplified. The code first traverses the tree using a queue to find the last node. Then it uses the queue again to locate its parent, detach the last node by setting the parent�s left or right child to null.

4. **Level Order Printing:** Uses a proper level order traversal to print the tree, making the output easier to understand.


How to Use:

1. Compile:  `javac RemoveLastElementOfTree.java`
2. Run: `java RemoveLastElementOfTree`  (The example tree is built-in)

You can modify the `main` method to create different tree structures to test with.
