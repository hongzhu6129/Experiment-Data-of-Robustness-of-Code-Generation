To compile and run this from the command line:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `MultiplicationTable.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the command `javac MultiplicationTable.java`.
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled program with the input number as a command-line argument:  `java MultiplicationTable 8` (replace 8 with any number you want).


This version handles the case where no input is provided or the input is not a valid integer, providing more robust error handling.  It uses `Integer.parseInt()` to convert the String input from `args` to an integer and includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the input is not a valid integer.
