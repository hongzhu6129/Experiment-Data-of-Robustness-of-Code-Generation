Key Improvements:

1. **Clearer Comments:** Added comments to explain the purpose of the code and the logic behind turboprop primes.
2. **Helper Function:** Introduced a helper function `isTurbopropPrime()` to separate the turboprop prime logic from the main method, making the code more organized and readable.
3. **String Rotation:**  Used string manipulation for digit rotation, which is more efficient than mathematical manipulation for this purpose.
4. **Correctness:**  The code now accurately identifies and prints all turboprop primes below 100.
5. **Efficiency:** The `is_Prime` function is optimized by only checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
6. **Output Formatting:** Added a newline at the end of the output for better readability.


This revised code directly addresses the prompt's requirements, provides a correct solution, and is well-structured and documented.
