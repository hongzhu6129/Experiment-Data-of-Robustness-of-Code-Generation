Key improvements in this code:

* **Clarity and Comments:**  The code is well-commented, explaining each step.
* **Error Handling:** It now includes a check to handle potential `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if the `year` value is outside the valid range of the LinkedList. This makes the code more robust.
* **Illustrative Example:** Includes a second example to demonstrate how the error handling works when an out-of-bounds year is provided.
* **Meaningful Output:** Adds "Year" to the string inserted at the year position to make it clearer in the output.
* **`addFirst()` and `addLast()`:** Uses the more descriptive `addFirst()` and `addLast()` methods instead of relying solely on `add()` for the beginning and end insertions.  This makes the intent of the code more explicit.
