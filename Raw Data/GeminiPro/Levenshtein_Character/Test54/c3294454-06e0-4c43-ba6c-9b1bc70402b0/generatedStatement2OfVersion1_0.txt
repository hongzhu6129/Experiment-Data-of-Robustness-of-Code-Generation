**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input 1 | Input 2 | Expected Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 10 |
| Negative Numbers | -5 | -10 | -5 |
| Zero and Positive | 0 | 5 | 5 |
| Zero and Negative | 0 | -5 | 0 |
| Both Zero | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Equal Positive Numbers | 15 | 15 | 15 |
| Equal Negative Numbers | -8 | -8 | -8 |
| Positive and Negative | 7 | -3 | 7 |
| Negative and Positive | -12 | 4 | 4 |
| Large Positive Numbers | 2147483647 | 2147483646 | 2147483647 |  // Integer.MAX_VALUE and just below
| Large Negative Numbers | -2147483648 | -2147483647 | -2147483647 | // Integer.MIN_VALUE and just above


**How to Run the Test Cases:**

While you could manually enter these test cases, a more efficient approach is to create automated tests (using JUnit or TestNG, for example). Here's a basic example using JUnit:
