```java
public class StringPermutationsWithRepetition {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "abc";
        permutationWithRepeation(str);
    }

    private static void permutationWithRepeation(String str) {
        showPermutation(str, "");
    }

    private static void showPermutation(String str, String prefix) {
        if (prefix.length() == str.length()) {
            System.out.println(prefix);
            return;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            showPermutation(str, prefix + str.charAt(i));
        }
    }
}
```


Explanation:

1. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - This is the entry point of the program.
   - It calls `permutationWithRepeation` with the input string.

2. **`permutationWithRepeation(String str)`:**
   - This method initializes the permutation generation process.
   - It calls `showPermutation` with the original string and an empty prefix.  The empty prefix represents the permutation being built up.

3. **`showPermutation(String str, String prefix)`:**
   - This is the recursive method that generates the permutations.
   - **Base Case:** If the length of the `prefix` equals the length of the original `str`, it means a complete permutation has been formed.  It prints the `prefix` and returns.
   - **Recursive Step:** It iterates through each character of the original `str`. In each iteration, it adds the current character to the `prefix` and makes a recursive call to `showPermutation` with the updated `prefix`. This explores all possible combinations by adding each character of the original string at each position.



Example with "abc":

The code will generate the following output:

```
aaa
aab
aac
aba
abb
abc
aca
acb
acc
baa
bab
bac
bba
bbb
bbc
bca
bcb
bcc
caa
cab
cac
cba
cbb
cbc
cca
ccb
ccc 
```


Key Difference from Permutations without Repetition:

The crucial difference between this code (permutations *with* repetition) and code for permutations *without* repetition is that in the `showPermutation` method, we are iterating through *all* characters of the original string in each recursive call.  In permutations *without* repetition, you would typically use a mechanism (like swapping characters or using a boolean array) to keep track of which characters have already been used in the current permutation so that they are not repeated.
