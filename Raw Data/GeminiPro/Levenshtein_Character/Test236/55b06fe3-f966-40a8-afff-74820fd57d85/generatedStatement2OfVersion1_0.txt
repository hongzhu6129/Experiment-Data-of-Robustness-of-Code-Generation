Key Improvements:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays, returning 0 in both cases.
2. **Clearer Comments:**  Comments explain the logic step by step, making the code easier to understand.
3. **Educational Output:** Prints the updated array (without duplicates) within the `removeDuplicates` method to help visualize the changes.  (Note: This output is for educational purposes and can be removed if you only need the length).
4. **More Test Cases:**  The `main` method includes several test cases, including edge cases, to demonstrate the code's robustness.


How it works (in brief):

The `removeDuplicates` method uses a two-pointer approach. `uniqueIndex` keeps track of the position where the next unique element should be placed. The loop iterates through the array. If a new unique element is encountered, it's placed at `uniqueIndex` and `uniqueIndex` is incremented. Finally, `uniqueIndex + 1` gives the length of the updated array (containing only unique elements).
