**Test Cases (including corner cases):**

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Output: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -74
   - Expected Output: 0 km

3. **North & South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0 
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0  (Longitude doesn't matter at poles)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

4. **Opposite sides of the Earth (Antipodes):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74 (New York)
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 106 (Near Perth, Australia)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)



5. **Points near the 180th Meridian (International Date Line):**
   - lat1: 10
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 10
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Output: A small value, as these points are close despite the longitude difference.  *This is a crucial test for handling the discontinuity at the date line.*

6. **Invalid Input:**
    - Test with non-numeric input (e.g., "abc") to ensure the program handles it gracefully without crashing.  You might want to add input validation to your code for this.

7. **Boundary values for Latitude:**
    - lat1: 90 (North Pole)
    - lon1: Any
    - lat2: 89.999 (very close to North Pole)
    - lon2: Any
    - Should calculate a small distance.

8. **Points near the equator:**
   - Test various points near the equator to ensure accuracy in these regions.

**How to Run Test Cases:**

- You can either manually input these values into your program multiple times.
- Or, even better, create a separate test class using a testing framework like JUnit. This will automate the process and provide more structured results.
