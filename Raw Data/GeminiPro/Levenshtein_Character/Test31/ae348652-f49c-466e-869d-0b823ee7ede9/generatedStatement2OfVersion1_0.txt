**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Example Case (Provided):**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -70
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

3. **Opposite Sides of the Earth (Antipodes):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 110 
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.09 km (approximately Earth's diameter)

4. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0  (Longitude doesn't matter at poles)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.09 km

5. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 180
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.09 km

6. **Points near the International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 10
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 10
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Distance: ~222.64 km (small distance due to date line crossing)

7. **Invalid Input (Boundary Conditions):**
   - lat1: -91 (outside valid range)
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 0
   - Expected:  The program should ideally handle this gracefully, either by throwing an exception or printing an error message. Latitude values must be between -90 and +90 inclusive. Similarly, longitude values are between -180 and 180 inclusive.


**How to Use Test Cases:**

1. **Manual Testing:**  Input these values into your program and verify the calculated distance matches the expected distance (within a reasonable tolerance due to floating-point calculations).
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  Create unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit.  This allows you to run the tests automatically and ensure your code remains correct even after making changes.  Here is an example of a JUnit test:
