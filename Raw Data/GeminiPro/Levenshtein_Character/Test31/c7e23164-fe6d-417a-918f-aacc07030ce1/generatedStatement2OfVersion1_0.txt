**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases including corner cases to thoroughly test the program:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Output: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -70
   - Expected Output: 0 km

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

4. **Antipodes (opposite sides of Earth):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 110  (180 degrees opposite longitude)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

5. **Points near the Prime Meridian/International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0.1      (Near Prime Meridian)
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: -0.1     (Near Prime Meridian)
   - Expected Output: A small value

   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 179.9   (Near Date Line)
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: -179.9  (Near Date Line)
   - Expected Output: A small value

6. **Extreme Latitude/Longitude Values:**
   - lat1: 90  (Max latitude)
   - lon1: 180 (Max longitude)
   - lat2: -90 (Min latitude)
   - lon2: -180(Min longitude)
   - Expected Output:  ~20015.08 km
