**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **`contains7()` Helper Function:** This function efficiently checks if a number contains the digit 7.  It uses a `while` loop and the modulo operator (`%`) to examine each digit.

2. **Clearer `count_nums_not_7()`:** The main counting logic is now more readable.  It iterates from 1 to `n`, calling `contains7()` for each number.

3. **Example Usage in `main()`:** The `main()` method demonstrates how to use the `count_nums_not_7()` function with different inputs, making the code easier to understand and test.

4. **Comments:**  The code includes Javadoc-style comments to explain the purpose of each method and parameter.  This significantly improves readability and maintainability.


This revised solution directly addresses the prompt's requirements while also incorporating good coding practices. It's more efficient, easier to understand, and better structured than the original attempt.
