**Test Cases (Conceptual - since visual output is hard to automate):**

1. **Basic Functionality:**  Run the program and visually verify that a face is printed as designed.  Check for the correct characters, spacing, and overall shape.

2. **Character Encoding:** Test on different systems/consoles with different character encodings to ensure the characters display correctly.  Sometimes special characters like " " might not render as intended.

3. **Output Redirection:** Redirect the program's output to a file and verify the file contents match the expected face.  This tests the output stream handling.

4. **Integration (if applicable):** If this `printFace()` method is part of a larger program, test the integration by calling `printFace()` from other parts of the application and ensure it behaves as expected in the context of the overall program.


**Corner Cases (Less applicable for simple output but good to consider for robust code):**

* **Empty Input/Arguments:** In this specific case, there's no input, so this isn't a relevant corner case.  However, if the `printFace` function were modified to accept arguments (e.g., to customize the face), then testing with null or empty arguments would become important.
* **Resource Limits (Highly unlikely here):**  In very complex output scenarios, you might consider extreme cases like what happens if there's insufficient memory or disk space to print the entire output. This is not a practical concern for a small program like this face printer.
