public class RemoveLastElementFromGreenSet {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a HashSet (Green set is not a standard Java collection, so using HashSet)
        Set<String> greenSet = new HashSet<>();

        // Add some elements
        greenSet.add("Lime");
        greenSet.add("Emerald");
        greenSet.add("Olive");
        greenSet.add("Forest");

        // Retrieving and removing the last element is tricky with HashSet because it doesn't inherently have an order.
        // We need to convert to an ordered collection like an ArrayList.
        if (!greenSet.isEmpty()) { // Check if the set is empty before proceeding
            String lastElement = null;
            for (String element : greenSet) { // Iterate to find the "last" added element (which is not truly deterministic in a HashSet)
                lastElement = element; // This will end up with the element that happened to be iterated through last
            }


            System.out.println("Original Set: " + greenSet);

            if (lastElement != null) {
                greenSet.remove(lastElement);
                System.out.println("Removed element: " + lastElement);
                System.out.println("Set after removal: " + greenSet);
            }

        } else {
            System.out.println("The set is empty.");

Explanation:

1. **HashSet Limitations:** `HashSet` doesn't guarantee any specific order of elements.  Therefore, the concept of a "last" element is not directly applicable.  The iteration order can change based on the internal hashing.

2. **Simulating "Last" Element:**  The code iterates through the `HashSet`.  The `lastElement` variable will hold the value of the element that happened to be iterated through last.  It's important to understand that this is *not* a reliable way to get the last *added* element because `HashSet` doesn't preserve insertion order.

3. **Removal:**  We then use `greenSet.remove(lastElement)` to remove the element that was retrieved in the previous step.

4. **Empty Set Check:** The code now includes a check to see if the set is empty *before* attempting to retrieve and remove an element. This avoids a `NullPointerException` if the set is empty.

5. **ArrayList Alternative (if order is crucial):**  If you absolutely need to maintain the insertion order and reliably retrieve the last *added* element, you should use `LinkedHashSet` instead of `HashSet`.  `LinkedHashSet` remembers the order in which elements were added.



Example Output (will vary because HashSet iteration order is not fixed):


```
Original Set: [Lime, Emerald, Olive, Forest]
Removed element: Forest  (Or any other element depending on iteration order)
Set after removal: [Lime, Emerald, Olive]
```
