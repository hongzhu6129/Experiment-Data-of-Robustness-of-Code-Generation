Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles null and empty arrays:**  The code now correctly handles cases where one or both of the input arrays are `null` or empty.  This prevents `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` errors.
* **Clearer logic:** The comparison logic is simplified and more readable.
* **More test cases:** Additional test cases are included to demonstrate the handling of various scenarios, including empty arrays and arrays with only one element. This helps ensure the robustness of the code.
* **Helper method:** The `compareFirstAndLast` method encapsulates the comparison logic, making the `main` method cleaner.



This revised version is more robust and handles edge cases appropriately. It's always good practice to consider potential issues like null or empty inputs when working with arrays.
