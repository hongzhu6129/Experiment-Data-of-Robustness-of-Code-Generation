Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles exponent = 0:**  The base case `exponent == 0` correctly returns 1.
2. **Handles Negative Exponents (Conceptual):** The code includes a check for negative exponents.  The ideal solution with division would calculate a reciprocal.  This has been left for understanding even if the question disallows it. The solution as it exists throws exceptions for these cases.
3. **Simulates Multiplication:** The core logic uses nested loops and repeated addition to effectively perform multiplication. The `increment` variable helps accumulate the result correctly in each iteration.
4. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `result` and `increment` makes the code more readable.
5. **Comprehensive `main` Method:**  The `main` method now includes multiple test cases, demonstrating various scenarios, including the base case and larger exponents.
6. **Error handling for 0 as base with negative exponents**: The solution includes `try-catch` blocks to prevent application crashing due to negative exponents with base = 0.


This improved version adheres to the problem constraints, is more efficient than using recursion, and provides better clarity and error handling.
