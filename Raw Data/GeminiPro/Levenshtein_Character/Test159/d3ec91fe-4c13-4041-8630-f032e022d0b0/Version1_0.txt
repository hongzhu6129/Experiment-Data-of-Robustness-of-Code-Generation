**Problem Description:**

Write a Java program that takes a string, splits it into individual words, and then prints the words in reverse order.

**Java Code:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ReverseString {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Get the input string from the user
        System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
        String str = input.nextLine();

        // Split the string into words
        String[] words = str.split(" ");

        // Print the words in reverse order
        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            System.out.print(words[i] + " ");
        }

        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

**Corner Cases:**

* **Empty string:** The program should handle an empty string without crashing.
* **String with a single word:** The program should handle a string with only one word without crashing.

**Other Test Cases:**

* **String with multiple words:** The program should correctly reverse the order of the words in the string.
* **String with special characters:** The program should handle strings that contain special characters, such as punctuation marks and spaces.
* **String with multiple spaces:** The program should handle strings that contain multiple spaces between words.
* **Long string:** The program should be able to handle long strings without crashing or running out of memory.

**Example Input and Output:**

**Input:**

```
Hello world!
```

**Output:**

```
world! Hello
```

**Input:**

```
This is a test string.
```

**Output:**

```
string test a is This
```
