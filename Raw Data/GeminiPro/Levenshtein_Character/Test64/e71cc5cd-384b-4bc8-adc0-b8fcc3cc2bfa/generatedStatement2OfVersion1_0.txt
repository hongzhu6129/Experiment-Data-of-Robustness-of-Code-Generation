**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Corner Cases:**  The `areFirstAndLastEqual` method now explicitly handles `null` and empty arrays.  I've chosen to return `false` in these cases, but you could modify this behavior (e.g., throw an exception) if a different approach makes more sense in your context.  It also handles single-element arrays correctly.

2. **Clearer Testing:** The `test` method helps to present the test cases and results in a more organized way.

3. **Conciseness:** The logic is streamlined.  We can directly return the comparison result once the corner cases are handled.

4. **Flexibility:** The `areFirstAndLastEqual` method is separate from the `main` method, making it reusable in other parts of your code if needed.
