**Educational Paper on Iterations**

**Introduction:**
Iterations are a powerful programming construct that allow us to repeat a block of code a specific number of times or until a certain condition is met. In Java, we can use the following iteration statements:

* **for** loop: Repeats a block of code a fixed number of times.
* **while** loop: Repeats a block of code until a condition becomes false.
* **do-while** loop: Repeats a block of code at least once, even if the condition is false.
* **foreach** loop: Iterates over each element in a collection or array.

**for Loop:**
The for loop has the following syntax:

```java
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

The initialization expression is executed once before the loop starts. The condition expression is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop continues. The increment expression is executed after each iteration.

**Example:**

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

**while Loop:**
The while loop has the following syntax:

```java
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

The condition expression is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop continues. Otherwise, the loop terminates.

**Example:**

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

**do-while Loop:**
The do-while loop has the following syntax:

```java
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

The code block is executed at least once before the condition expression is evaluated. If the condition is true, the loop continues. Otherwise, the loop terminates.

**Example:**

```java
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 10);
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

**foreach Loop:**
The foreach loop has the following syntax:

```java
for (type variable : collection) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

The variable is assigned the value of each element in the collection. The code block is executed for each element in the collection.

**Example:**

```java
int[] numbers = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

**Test Cases:**

**Corner Cases:**

* **Empty collection:**
```java
List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```
Output:
```

```

* **Null collection:**
```java
List<Integer> numbers = null;
for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```
Output:
```
java.lang.NullPointerException
```

**Regular Cases:**

* **Positive integers:**
```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```
Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

* **Negative integers:**
```java
int[] numbers = {-1, -2, -3, -4, -5};
for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```
Output:
```
-1
-2
-3
-4
-5
```

* **Mixed integers:**
```java
int[] numbers = {1, -2, 3, -4, 5};
for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```
Output:
```
1
-2
3
-4
5
```

* **Strings:**
```java
String[] words = {"one", "two", "three", "four", "five"};
for (String word : words) {
    System.out.println(word);
}
```
Output:
```
one
two
three
four
five
```
