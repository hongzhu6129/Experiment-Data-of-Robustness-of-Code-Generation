        if (num == 0) {
            System.out.println("Multiplication table of 0 is trivial (all results are 0).");
            return; // Or print a single line: 0 x 1 = 0
        }


        System.out.println("Multiplication table of " + num + ":");

## Test Cases:

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner/edge cases:

1. **Positive Number:**
   - Input: `7`
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     Multiplication table of 7:
     7 x 1 = 7
     7 x 2 = 14
     ...
     7 x 10 = 70
     ```

2. **Negative Number:**
   - Input: `-5`
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     Multiplication table of -5:
     -5 x 1 = -5
     -5 x 2 = -10
     ...
     -5 x 10 = -50
     ```

3. **Zero:** (Corner Case)
   - Input: `0`
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     Multiplication table of 0 is trivial (all results are 0).
     ```  (or a single line like `0 x 1 = 0`)

4. **Large Positive Number:**
   - Input: `12345`
   - Expected Output:  (Verify the calculations are correct).


5. **Large Negative Number:**
   - Input: `-98765`
    - Expected Output: (Verify the calculations are correct).

6. **Input Validation (Optional but Recommended):** While not strictly a test case for `printMultiplicationTable()`, your `main` method should ideally handle invalid inputs (like non-numeric input) gracefully.  You could add a `try-catch` block around `scanner.nextInt()` to prevent crashes if the user types in something like "abc".  A test case would be entering non-numeric input and checking if the program handles it without crashing (e.g., prints an error message).


**How to run the test cases:**

You can manually run the program multiple times with these inputs and visually verify the output.  For more automated testing, you could use JUnit (a Java testing framework) to write unit tests.  This is especially useful for larger projects.  JUnit allows you to automate the process of providing inputs, running the function, and checking that the output matches what you expect.
