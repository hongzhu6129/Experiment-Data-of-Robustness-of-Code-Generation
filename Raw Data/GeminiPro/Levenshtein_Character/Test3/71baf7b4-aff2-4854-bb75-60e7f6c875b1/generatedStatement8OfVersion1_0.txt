4. **Large Positive Integer:**  (Tests for potential overflow if not using `long`)
   - Input: `100000` (or even larger)
   - Expected Output:  Correct multiplication table up to 10 times the input.

5. **Large Negative Integer:** (Similar overflow check)
   - Input: `-100000`
   - Expected Output: Correct multiplication table.

6. **Invalid Input (Non-Integer):**  (Important to handle!)
   - Input: `hello` or `3.14`
   - Expected Behavior: The program should either gracefully handle the error (e.g., print an error message and exit/re-prompt) or throw an `InputMismatchException` that is caught and handled. The provided code uses `Scanner.nextInt()`, which will throw this exception if the input is not an integer.



**How to Run the Tests:**

You can manually test the program by running it and entering the input values.  For more automated testing, you can use JUnit (or another Java testing framework):
