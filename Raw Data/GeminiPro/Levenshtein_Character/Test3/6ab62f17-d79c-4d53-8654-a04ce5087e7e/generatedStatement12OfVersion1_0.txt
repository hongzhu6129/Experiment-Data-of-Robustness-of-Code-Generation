These test cases cover positive, negative, zero, large, and small number inputs, ensuring that the `printScalarTable` method works correctly for a range of values.  You could also add tests for very large numbers to check for potential integer overflow (although the multiplication in Java will just wrap around in that case). Testing with these different inputs will help validate the correctness and robustness of the program.
