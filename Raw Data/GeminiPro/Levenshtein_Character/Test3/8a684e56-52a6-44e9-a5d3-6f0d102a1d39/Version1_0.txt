**Test Cases:**

1. **Positive Integer:**
   - Input: 7
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     Multiplication table of 7 up to 10:
     7 x 1 = 7
     7 x 2 = 14
     7 x 3 = 21
     7 x 4 = 28
     7 x 5 = 35
     7 x 6 = 42
     7 x 7 = 49
     7 x 8 = 56
     7 x 9 = 63
     7 x 10 = 70
     ```

2. **Zero:**
   - Input: 0
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     Multiplication table of 0 up to 10:
     0 x 1 = 0
     0 x 2 = 0
     ...
     0 x 10 = 0
     ```

3. **Negative Integer:**
   - Input: -5
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     Multiplication table of -5 up to 10:
     -5 x 1 = -5
     -5 x 2 = -10
     ...
     -5 x 10 = -50
     ```

4. **Large Positive Integer:**
   - Input: 12345
   - Expected Output:  (Verify a few lines of the output to ensure correctness)
     ```
     Multiplication table of 12345 up to 10:
     12345 x 1 = 12345
     12345 x 2 = 24690
     ...
     12345 x 10 = 123450
     ```

5. **Large Negative Integer:**
   - Input: -98765
   - Expected Output: (Verify a few lines)
      ```
      Multiplication table of -98765 up to 10:
      -98765 x 1 = -98765
      -98765 x 2 = -197530
      ...
      -98765 x 10 = -987650
      ```


These test cases cover the typical scenarios (positive, zero, negative) as well as larger numbers to check for potential overflow issues (though Java's `int` type has a large range so overflow is less likely).   The important thing is to ensure the logic is correct for all integer inputs.
