2. **Input:** 12
   **Expected Output:** (Similar output, just with 12 as the base number)

**Corner/Edge Cases:**

3. **Input:** 0
   **Expected Output:** (All results will be 0)

4. **Input:** -3
   **Expected Output:** (Handles negative numbers correctly)

5. **Input:** Integer.MAX_VALUE  (2147483647)
   **Expected Output:** (Might lead to integer overflow for some multiples.  Observe and document the behavior � the program should ideally not crash).

6. **Input:** Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648)
    **Expected Output:** (Similar to the MAX_VALUE case, check for overflow).

7. **Invalid Input:** (Not strictly a corner case for the `printScalarTable` method, but important for the program as a whole):
   * **Input:**  "abc" (or any non-integer input)
   **Expected Behavior:** The `Scanner.nextInt()` method will throw an `InputMismatchException`.  Your program should handle this gracefully (e.g., using a `try-catch` block) and prompt the user to enter valid input.  The provided code currently does *not* have error handling; you'll need to add it.
