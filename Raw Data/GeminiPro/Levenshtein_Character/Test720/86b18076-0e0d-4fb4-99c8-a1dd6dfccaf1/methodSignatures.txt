 Only use the method signatures  void countingSort(int[], int, int), public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the CountingSort algorithm.\nAccording to Wikipedia "In computer science, counting sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value. It uses arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. Its running time is linear based on the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly wider than the number of items. However, it is often used as a subroutine in another sorting algorithm, radix sort, which handles larger keys more efficiently". \n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n Avoid using Solution as the class name.
