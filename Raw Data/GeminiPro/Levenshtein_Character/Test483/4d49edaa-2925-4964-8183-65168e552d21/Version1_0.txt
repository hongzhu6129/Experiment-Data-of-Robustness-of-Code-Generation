Explanation and improvements:

1. **Input Validation (Added):** The code now uses a `Scanner` to get input from the user. It also includes a check to ensure that `year1` is always less than or equal to `year2` by swapping them if necessary.  This makes the logic simpler and handles cases where the user enters the years in reverse order.

2. **Loop for Calculation:** The `main` method now uses a `for` loop to iterate through the years between `year1` (inclusive) and `year2` (exclusive). This is crucial to calculate the total number of days correctly.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output message now clearly states the range of years being considered.

4. **Closed Scanner:**  The `scanner.close()` statement has been added to release the system resources used by the scanner.  This is good practice.

5. **`number_of_days` Method:** This method correctly returns the number of days in a given year based on whether it is a leap year or not.

6. **`is_Leap_Year` Method:**  This method correctly implements the logic to determine if a year is a leap year.


How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DaysBetweenYears.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the command `javac DaysBetweenYears.java`.
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the command `java DaysBetweenYears`. The program will prompt you to enter the two years.


Example Usage:

```
Enter the first year: 2000
Enter the second year: 2004
The number of days between 2000 and 2004 is: 1461 
```
