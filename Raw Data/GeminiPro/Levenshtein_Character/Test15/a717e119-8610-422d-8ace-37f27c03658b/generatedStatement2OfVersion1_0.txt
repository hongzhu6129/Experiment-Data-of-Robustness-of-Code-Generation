| Decimal Input | Expected Hexadecimal Output | Description                       |

| 1            | 1                           | Simple single digit case          |
| 9            | 9                           | Highest single decimal digit      |
| 10           | A                           | First double-digit requiring A-F |
| 15           | F                           | Highest single hex digit           |

| 16777215    | FFFFFF                       | Maximum value for 6 hex digits (24-bit) |
| -1           | (Handles Negative)          | Negative number.  How it's handled depends on desired behavior (e.g., using two's complement or throwing an error). |

**Explanation of Corner Cases and Considerations:**

* **Zero:** Handling zero is essential as it's a special case where the loop won't execute.
* **Single Digits (1-9):** These are the basic conversion cases.
* **10-15:** This range tests the conversion to hexadecimal letters (A-F).
* **16 and Multiples:**  Tests the handling of place values in hexadecimal.
* **255, 256:** These test the transition between different numbers of hexadecimal digits.
* **Large Numbers:**  (e.g., 16777215 and Integer.MAX_VALUE) push the limits of the integer type.
* **Negative Numbers:** You need to decide how to handle negative input. The provided code doesn't explicitly deal with negatives. Common approaches include:
    * Two's complement representation (which is how Java stores negative integers internally).  You'd likely need to use `Long.toHexString()` if you want Java to handle this for you automatically.
    * Throwing an exception.
    * Returning a special value or indicator (e.g., prepend a "-" sign).

**Improved Code (Handling Negatives with Two's Complement):**

If you want to handle negative numbers using two's complement, use the built-in `Long.toHexString()` method, which correctly handles all integer values:
