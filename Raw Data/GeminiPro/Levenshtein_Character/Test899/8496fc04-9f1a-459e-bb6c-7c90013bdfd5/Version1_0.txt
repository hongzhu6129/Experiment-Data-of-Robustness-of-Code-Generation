        // Count the occurrences of each character
        for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
            charCounts[c - 'a']++;
        }

        // Find the first character with a count of 1
        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            if (charCounts[str.charAt(i) - 'a'] == 1) {
                return i;

        return -1; // Should not reach here as per problem statement (at least one unique char)
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Character Counting Array:** Uses an `int` array `charCounts` of size 26 (for lowercase English alphabet characters) to efficiently store the frequency of each character.  
2. **Counting Occurrences:** The first loop iterates through the input string, incrementing the count in `charCounts` for each character encountered.
3. **Finding the First Unique:** The second loop iterates through the string again.  For each character, it checks the corresponding count in `charCounts`.  If the count is 1, that character is unique, and its index is returned.
4. **Handles Edge Cases (sort of):** I added a return of -1 to comply with the method signature. However, according to the problem description ("assume that there is at least one unique character"), this should never happen. I included more test cases to demonstrate. If the assumption doesn't hold,  -1 indicates that no unique character was found. 
5. **ASCII Assumption:** This code assumes the input string contains only lowercase English alphabet characters.  If you need to handle other characters (uppercase, symbols, etc.), you would need to modify the `charCounts` array and the indexing logic accordingly (e.g., use a HashMap to store character counts).


**Example Usage & Output**

```
Original String: wresource
First unique character of the above: 0
Original String: aabbccddeeffgg
First unique character of the above: -1
Original String: loveleetcode
First unique character of the above: 2
```
