**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Integers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 2. Negative Integers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 3. Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2.0 | 0.0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | Division by zero | Remainder with zero divisor |
| 6. Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13.0 | 8.0 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0.0 |
| 7. Large Numbers | 1000000 | 1000 | 1001000 | 999000 | 1000000000 | 1000.0 | 0.0 |
| 8. Small Numbers | 0.001 | 0.002 | 0.003 | -0.001 | 0.000002 | 0.5 | 0.0 |
| 9. Integer Overflow (potential) | Integer.MAX_VALUE | 1 |  Overflow  | Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1  | Overflow |  Overflow  |  Overflow  |
| 10. Integer Underflow (potential) | Integer.MIN_VALUE | -1 | Underflow | Integer.MIN_VALUE + 1 | Overflow | Overflow | Overflow |

**Explanation of Corner Cases:**

* **Division by Zero (Test Case 5):**  Dividing by zero is undefined in mathematics and will cause an `ArithmeticException` in most programming languages.  The code handles this by explicitly checking for `num2 == 0` and printing an error message.
* **Remainder with Zero Divisor (Test Case 5):** The remainder operation with a zero divisor is also undefined.  The code handles this similarly to division by zero.
* **Overflow/Underflow (Test Cases 9 & 10):**  If the numbers are very large or very small, the results of the arithmetic operations might exceed the maximum or minimum values that can be stored in the data type (e.g., `int`).  This can lead to unexpected results (wrapping around).  Java will not throw an exception for integer overflow/underflow; it will just produce an incorrect result. Using `long` or `BigInteger` can mitigate this issue for integers, while `double` has its own limitations for very large or very small floating-point values.


By running your program with these test cases, you can verify that it's producing the correct results and handling corner cases appropriately.  It is especially important to consider overflow and underflow situations in production code.
