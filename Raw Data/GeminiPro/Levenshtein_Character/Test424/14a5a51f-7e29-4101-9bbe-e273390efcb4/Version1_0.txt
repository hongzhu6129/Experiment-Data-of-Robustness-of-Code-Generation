```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CharCounter {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
        String inputString = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter the character to count: ");
        char targetChar = scanner.nextLine().charAt(0);

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < inputString.length(); i++) {
            if (inputString.charAt(i) == targetChar) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Occurrences of '" + targetChar + "': " + count);

        long endTime = System.nanoTime();
        displayExecutionTime(endTime - startTime);

        scanner.close();
    }

    private static void displayExecutionTime(long elapsedTime) {
        System.out.println("Execution time: " + elapsedTime + " nanoseconds");
    }
}
```


Here's how this code fulfills the requirements:

1. **`public static void main(String[] args)`:** This is the main method where the program execution begins.  It handles user input, counts character occurrences, and displays the results.

2. **`private static void displayExecutionTime(long elapsedTime)`:** This method takes the elapsed time (calculated in `main`) as input and prints it to the console.

3. **Character Counting Logic:** The core logic is inside the `main` method.  It iterates through the input string and increments the `count` whenever the `targetChar` is found.

4. **User Input:**  The `Scanner` class is used to get the string and the character to search for from the user.

5. **Execution Time Measurement:** The `System.nanoTime()` method is used at the beginning and end of the core logic to measure execution time, which is then passed to `displayExecutionTime`.

6. **Resource Management:** The `scanner.close()` statement ensures proper resource management by closing the `Scanner` after it's no longer needed.


**Example Usage:**

```
Enter a string: Hello World
Enter the character to count: o
Occurrences of 'o': 2
Execution time: ... nanoseconds
```
