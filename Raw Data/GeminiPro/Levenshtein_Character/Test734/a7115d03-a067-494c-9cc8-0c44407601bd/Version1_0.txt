                {1, 4, 7, 11, 15},
                {2, 5, 8, 12, 19},
                {3, 6, 9, 16, 22},

        } else {
            System.out.println("Target " + target + " not found in the matrix.");

        int col = n - 1;

        while (row < m && col >= 0) {
            if (matrix[row][col] == target) {
                return new int[]{row, col}; // Target found
            } else if (matrix[row][col] < target) {
                row++; // Move down to the next row (larger values)
            } else {
                col--; // Move left to the previous column (smaller values)

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `m` and `n` for rows and columns is standard and improves readability.

2. **Return an `int[]`:** The `Saddleback` function returns an `int[]` array of size 2 to store the row and column index of the target.  This is much cleaner than printing directly from within the search function.  If the target isn't found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.

3. **Concise Search Logic:** The `while` loop condition and the `if-else if-else` structure within it implement the saddleback search efficiently.  The comments explain the logic of moving down or left based on the comparison with the target.

4. **Error Handling:**  The `main` method checks the returned array from `Saddleback` to determine if the target was found and prints an appropriate message.

5. **Example Usage:**  The `main` method provides a sample matrix and target to demonstrate how to use the `Saddleback` function.

6. **Adherence to Method Signatures:** The code strictly uses the provided `main` and `Saddleback` method signatures.


This improved code is more robust, easier to understand, and follows best practices for function design and error handling.
