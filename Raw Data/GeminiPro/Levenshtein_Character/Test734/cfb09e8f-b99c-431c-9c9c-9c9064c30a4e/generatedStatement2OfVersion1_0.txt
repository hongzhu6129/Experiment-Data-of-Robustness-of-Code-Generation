Key improvements and explanations in this refined version:

* **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:**  The code strictly uses `public static void main(String[] args)` and `private static int[] Saddleback(int[][], int, int, int)` as requested.
* **Return an `int[]`:**  The `Saddleback` method now returns an `int[]` to hold both the row and column index. This is more standard practice than using `System.out.println` inside the search function.
* **Handles "Not Found" Gracefully:** The code returns `{-1, -1}` if the target is not found. The `main` method then checks this and prints an appropriate message.
* **Enhanced Comments:**  The code now includes more explanatory comments.
* **Example Usages:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to call the `Saddleback` method and handle its output, including a test with a value not in the array.
* **Efficiency:** The Saddleback search algorithm is efficient for this type of sorted 2D array, having a time complexity of O(m + n) where 'm' is the number of rows and 'n' is the number of columns.
