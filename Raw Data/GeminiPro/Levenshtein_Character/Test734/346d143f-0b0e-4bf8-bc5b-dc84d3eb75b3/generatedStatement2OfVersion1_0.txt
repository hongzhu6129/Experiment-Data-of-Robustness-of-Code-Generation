**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clear Method Signatures:** The code adheres to the specified method signatures: `public static void main(String[])` and `private static int[] Saddleback(int[][], int, int, int)`.

2. **Saddleback Search Algorithm:** The `Saddleback` method correctly implements the saddleback search algorithm. It starts from the top-right corner of the matrix and moves either down or left based on the comparison with the target.

3. **Return Array for Coordinates:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` containing the row and column indices of the target element.  If the element is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`. This makes it easy for the `main` method to check if the element was found and print the appropriate message.

4. **Clear Example in `main`:**  The `main` method provides a clear example of how to use the `Saddleback` method, including initializing a sample 2D array and handling the search results.

5. **Comments and Readability:**  The code includes comments to explain the logic and improve readability.


**How Saddleback Search Works:**

The saddleback search algorithm is efficient for sorted 2D arrays.  It leverages the sorted property to eliminate either a row or a column in each comparison, making it faster than a linear search in most cases. The time complexity of Saddleback search is O(m + n) in the worst case, where 'm' is the number of rows and 'n' is the number of columns.
