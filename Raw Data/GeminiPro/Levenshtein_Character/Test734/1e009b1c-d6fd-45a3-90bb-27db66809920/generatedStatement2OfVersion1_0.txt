**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Saddleback Search Algorithm:** The `Saddleback` method efficiently searches the sorted matrix. It starts from the top-right corner.  If the current element is smaller than the target, it moves down (to a larger element). If it's larger, it moves left (to a smaller element).

2. **Clearer Return Value:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` where `result[0]` is the row and `result[1]` is the column. If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`. This makes it easier to check the result in `main`.

3. **Error Handling:** The `main` method now properly handles the case where the target is not found.

4. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` method with a sample matrix and target value. It also includes a test case where the target is not present.

5. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic within the `Saddleback` function.


This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and handles edge cases correctly.  It follows the specified method signatures.
