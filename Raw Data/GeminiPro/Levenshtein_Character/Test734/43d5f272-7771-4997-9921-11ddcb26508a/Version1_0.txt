        int[][] matrix = {
                {1, 4, 7, 11, 15},
                {2, 5, 8, 12, 19},
                {3, 6, 9, 16, 22},

        while (row < m && col >= 0) {
            if (matrix[row][col] == target) {
                return new int[]{row, col}; // Target found
            } else if (matrix[row][col] < target) {
                row++; // Move down to the next row
            } else {
                col--; // Move left to the previous column

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly adheres to the requested `main` and `Saddleback` method signatures.

2. **Saddleback Search Implementation:** The `Saddleback` method efficiently searches the matrix.  It starts at the top-right corner.
   - If the current element is equal to the target, the position is returned.
   - If the current element is smaller than the target, it means the target cannot be in the current row (since rows are sorted), so we move down to the next row.
   - If the current element is larger than the target, it means the target cannot be in the current column (since columns are sorted), so we move left to the previous column.

3. **Return Array for Coordinates:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` containing the row and column indices of the target. If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`. This makes it easy for the `main` method to handle both cases.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method provides a sample matrix and target value.  It calls `Saddleback` and then prints the result in a user-friendly format.


**How Saddleback Search Works (Example):**

Let's say `target = 5` in the given matrix:

1. Start at `matrix[0][4]` (15). 15 > 5, so move left.
2. `matrix[0][3]` (11). 11 > 5, so move left.
3. `matrix[0][2]` (7). 7 > 5, so move left.
4. `matrix[0][1]` (4). 4 < 5, so move down.
5. `matrix[1][1]` (5). Found! Return {1, 1}.


This approach is efficient because it eliminates a row or a column in each step, leading to a time complexity of O(m + n), where 'm' is the number of rows and 'n' is the number of columns. It's much better than a brute-force search (O(m*n)).
