**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clear Method Signatures:** The code strictly adheres to the required `main` and `Saddleback` method signatures.

2. **Saddleback Search Algorithm:** The `Saddleback` function efficiently implements the saddleback search algorithm. It starts from the top-right corner of the matrix and moves either down or left based on the comparison with the target.

3. **Return an Array:** The `Saddleback` function now returns an `int[]` containing the row and column indices of the target. If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.

4. **Clearer Output:** The `main` function handles the result from `Saddleback` and prints a user-friendly message indicating whether the target was found and its location.

5. **Example Usage:**  The `main` method provides a clear example of how to use the `Saddleback` function with a sample 2D array and target value.

6. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic and the steps involved in the `Saddleback` function.


This improved version is more efficient, readable, and adheres to the specified requirements, making it a complete and functional solution.
