Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `m` and `n` are used for rows and columns, making the code more readable.
2. **Return an Array:** The `Saddleback` function returns an `int[]` containing the row and column index.  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`. This is a common way to signal that a search was unsuccessful.
3. **Boundary Checks:** The `while` loop condition `row < m && col >= 0` ensures that the search stays within the matrix bounds.
4. **Concise Comments:** Comments explain the core logic of the saddleback search algorithm.
5. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function and handles the case where the target is not found. It also includes an additional test case with a target that is not present in the matrix.


This improved code is more robust, easier to understand, and follows best practices for function design and error handling.
