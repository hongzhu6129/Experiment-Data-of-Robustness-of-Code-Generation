Explanation and Improvements:

1. **`main` method:**
   - It iterates through odd numbers from 3 up to (but not including) 100.  Starting at 3 and incrementing by 2 avoids checking even numbers, which (except for 2) are never prime.
   - For each odd number `i`, it checks if both `i` and `i + 2` are prime using the `is_Prime` method.
   - If both are prime, it prints them as a twin prime pair.

2. **`is_Prime` method:**
   - **Base Cases:** Handles `n <= 1` (not prime), `n <= 3` (2 and 3 are prime).
   - **Divisibility by 2 and 3:**  Quickly checks if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, eliminating many composite numbers.
   - **6k � 1 Optimization:** All prime numbers greater than 3 can be expressed in the form 6k � 1 (where k is any integer).  The loop iterates with `i += 6` and checks `n % i` and `n % (i + 2)`, significantly reducing the number of divisors to test.  
   - **Loop Condition `i * i <= n`:**  We only need to check divisibility up to the square root of `n`. If `n` has a divisor greater than its square root, it must also have a divisor smaller than its square root.


Key improvements in this version:

- **Efficiency:** The 6k � 1 optimization and checking only up to the square root of `n` in `is_Prime` greatly improve efficiency.
- **Clarity:**  The code is well-commented and easier to understand.
- **Correctness:** The base cases and divisibility checks ensure accurate prime detection.
- **Style:** Follows standard Java conventions for naming and formatting.
