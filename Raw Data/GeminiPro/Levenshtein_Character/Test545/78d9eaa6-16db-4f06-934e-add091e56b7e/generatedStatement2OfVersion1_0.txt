**Explanation and How to Run:**

1. **Command-Line Argument:**  The program expects the file path as a command-line argument.
2. **File Object:** Creates a `File` object representing the file.
3. **Try-with-resources:**  Uses try-with-resources to ensure the `FileInputStream` is closed automatically, even if exceptions occur.
4. **`readAllBytes()`:**  The core part: `fis.readAllBytes()` reads the entire file content into a byte array. This method is available from Java 9 onwards.  If you're using an older Java version, see the alternative below.
5. **Error Handling:** The `catch` block handles potential `IOExceptions` during file reading.
6. **Example Output:** The code prints a confirmation message and the size of the byte array.  The commented-out section shows how to print a few bytes from the array if you want to verify the contents.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ReadFileToByteArray.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and compile: `javac ReadFileToByteArray.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the program, providing the file path as an argument:  `java ReadFileToByteArray /path/to/your/file.txt`  (Replace `/path/to/your/file.txt` with the actual path).



**Alternative for Older Java Versions (Pre-Java 9):**

If you are using a Java version older than 9, replace `fis.readAllBytes()` with the following:
