Key improvements in this educational version:

* **Clearer Explanation:**  The `demonstrateFloorEntry()` method includes comments and print statements to explain what's happening and the expected output.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** It handles the case where the provided key is `null`  or the `TreeMap` itself is `null` in a user-friendly way �  instead of letting a `NullPointerException` crash the program, we print informative messages, which is more suitable for educational purposes.
* **Generic Method:**  `demonstrateFloorEntry()` is now a generic method, making it adaptable to `TreeMap`s with different key and value types (e.g., `String`, `Integer`, custom objects).
* **Example with Strings:** Added an example using `String` keys to demonstrate the natural ordering of strings in a `TreeMap`.


This improved version is more suitable for an educational context because it focuses on clearly demonstrating the functionality of `floorEntry()` while handling potential issues and explaining the concepts involved.
