Key improvements and explanations in this version:

* **Optimization:** Several `break` statements are added to exit loops early when it becomes clear that no further solutions are possible within the given constraints.  This drastically reduces the number of iterations.
* **Duplicate Avoidance:** The inner loop for `b` now starts from `a + 1`. This prevents finding the same pair of cubes twice (e.g., (1, 12) and (12, 1) would be considered the same).
* **Clarity:** The code is restructured and comments are added to make the logic easier to follow.
* **Correctness:** The code accurately finds numbers expressible as the sum of two cubes in two (or more) different ways, prints the number itself, and clearly displays the different cube pairs that sum to it.
* **Limit Search to 'b'**: The inner loop to look for pairs (c, d) is limited to `b`, since `d` will always be less than or equal to `b` for any solution where `a < b`



This version significantly speeds up the process, especially for larger values of `n`.  It ensures the program finds and prints the solutions correctly and efficiently.
