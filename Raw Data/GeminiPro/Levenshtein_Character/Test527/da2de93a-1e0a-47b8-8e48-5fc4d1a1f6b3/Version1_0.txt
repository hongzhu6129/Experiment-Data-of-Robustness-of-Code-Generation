```java
public class Ramanujan {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1729; //  Ramanujan's number, the smallest such number.

        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            int a3 = a * a * a;
            if (a3 > n) break; // Optimization: No need to continue if a^3 exceeds n

            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) { // b starts from a+1 to avoid duplicates (e.g., 1^3 + 2^3 and 2^3 + 1^3)
                int b3 = b * b * b;
                if (a3 + b3 > n) break;  // Optimization

                int sum = a3 + b3;


                for (int c = 1; c <= n; c++) {
                    int c3 = c * c * c;
                    if (c3 > sum) break;  // Optimization

                    for (int d = c + 1; d <= n; d++) {
                        int d3 = d * d * d;

                        if (c3 + d3 > sum) break;  // Optimization

                        if (c3 + d3 == sum && (a != c || b != d)) {  //Found another pair (c, d) that sums to the same value!
                            System.out.println(sum + " = " + a + "^3 + " + b + "^3 = " + c + "^3 + " + d + "^3");
                            return; // Exit after finding the first such number
                        }
                    }

                }
            }
        }

    }

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Efficiency Optimizations:**  Several `break` statements are added inside the loops to stop unnecessary calculations when the sum of cubes exceeds `n` or `sum`. This significantly improves performance.

2. **Avoiding Duplicates:** The inner loop for `b` starts from `a + 1`. This prevents counting the same pair of cubes twice (e.g., 1� + 2� and 2� + 1�).

3. **Clarity and Readability:** The code is formatted consistently and uses meaningful variable names. Comments explain the logic.

4. **Correctness:** The condition `(a != c || b != d)` ensures that the two pairs of cubes (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct, fulfilling the requirement of "two (or more) different ways."

5. **Exit after Finding the First Such Number:** The `return;` statement exits the `main` method immediately after finding and printing the first Ramanujan number within the specified range.  If you want to find *all* such numbers within the range, you would remove the `return;` and let the loops complete.



How to Compile and Run:

1. Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. Compile: `javac Ramanujan.java`
3. Run:  `java Ramanujan`


This improved version will find Ramanujan numbers efficiently and correctly.  You can adjust the value of `n` to search within a different range.
