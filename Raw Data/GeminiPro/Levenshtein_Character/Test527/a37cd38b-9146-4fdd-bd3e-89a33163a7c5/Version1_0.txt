Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` makes the code more aligned with the mathematical problem.

2. **Optimizations:** Added `break` statements in the loops to avoid unnecessary calculations when `a3` or the sum of cubes exceeds `n`.  This significantly improves performance.

3. **Distinct Pair Check:**  The condition `c != a && c != b && d != a && d != b && c <= d` ensures that we only consider distinct pairs (a, b) and (c, d), and avoids duplicates due to the order of c and d.

4. **Two Distinct Ways Check:**  `prevB` is used to track the 'b' value of the first found representation.  We only print a result if a second representation is found with a different 'b' value, fulfilling the "two (or more) different ways" requirement.

5. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic and the purpose of the code sections.

6. **Flexibility:** You can easily change the value of `n` to search within different ranges.

7. **Early Exit (Optional):** The `return` statement after finding the first Ramanujan number is included if you only need *one* such number.  If you want *all* such numbers within the range, remove the `return` statement.



This improved version addresses the original prompt's requirements more precisely, is more efficient, and is easier to understand.
