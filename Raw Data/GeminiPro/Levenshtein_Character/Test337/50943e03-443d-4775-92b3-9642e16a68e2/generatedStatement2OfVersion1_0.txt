Key takeaway:  `intern()` ensures you get the canonical representation of the string, which is the version stored in the string pool. Using `==` to compare strings can lead to unexpected behavior unless you're specifically checking for referential equality (i.e., are they the same object). `equals()` compares string content.  Use `intern()` if you need to ensure that strings with the same content also share the same memory location (for efficiency or interning purposes).
