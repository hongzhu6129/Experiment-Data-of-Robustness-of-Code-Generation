Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly shows the original array and then the *conceptually* new array (represented by the first `newLength` elements of the modified original array). This helps to understand what's happening.  I've also added comments to make this distinction clear.
* **Efficiency:** The code directly modifies the input array `nums` in-place, rather than creating a new array, which is more memory-efficient.
* **Correctness:** The logic ensures that all occurrences of `val` are removed, and `k` correctly tracks the new length.
* **Adherence to Prompt:**  The code uses *only* the specified method signatures.
