**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` input, returning 0 in both cases.

2. **In-Place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` method modifies the original array in-place as requested, avoiding the creation of new arrays.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueIndex` replaces `j` for better readability, indicating its purpose.

4. **Concise Return:** The `return` statement is simplified to `uniqueIndex + 1`.

5. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** The `main` method demonstrates various test cases, including empty, null, and arrays with and without duplicates. It also clearly prints the new length and the modified array (up to the new length) using `Arrays.copyOfRange`. This helps visualize the changes made by `removeDuplicates`.

6. **Comments:** Added more comments to explain the logic and purpose of different code sections.



This improved version addresses the potential issues and provides a more robust and understandable solution to the problem.
