**Test Cases:**

1. **Normal Case:**
   - Range: 1 to 100 (as specified in the problem)
   - Expected Output:  Correctly prints numbers divisible by 3, 5, and both within this range.  For "both" this would include 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90.

2. **Empty Range:**
   - Range: 50 to 50
   - Expected Output: Prints 50 for divisible by 5, and nothing for divisible by 3 or both if 50 is used.  Adjust number to test all three scenarios.

3. **Reverse Range:**
   - Range: 100 to 1
   - Expected Output: Prints the "Invalid range" message.

4. **Range Starting at 0:**
   - Range: 0 to 50
   - Expected Output: Correctly handles 0 as divisible by both 3 and 5.

5. **Range with Negative Numbers:**
   - Range: -50 to 50
   - Expected Output: Correctly handles negative numbers divisible by 3, 5 and both. (e.g., -45, -30, -15, 0, 15, 30, 45)

6. **Large Range:**
   - Range: 1 to 1000  (Or even larger)
   - Expected Output:  Demonstrates the program's ability to handle larger ranges without issues.  This helps test performance and ensures no integer overflow problems.

7. **Boundary Cases (Edge Cases) within the range:**
   - Consider ranges that include numbers just below or above multiples of 3, 5, or 15 (e.g., 14 to 16, 29 to 31). This helps ensure the divisibility checks are accurate at the boundaries.



By running your program with these test cases, you can verify that it correctly handles various scenarios and produces the expected output.  This robust testing is crucial for ensuring code quality and reliability.
