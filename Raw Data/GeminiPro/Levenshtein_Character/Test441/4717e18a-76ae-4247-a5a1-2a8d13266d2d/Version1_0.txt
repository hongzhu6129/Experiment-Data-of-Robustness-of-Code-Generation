```java
import java.util.Calendar;

public class MinimumCalendarValues {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get a default calendar instance (represents current date and time)
        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();

        // Get minimum values for different fields
        int minYear = calendar.getActualMinimum(Calendar.YEAR);
        int minMonth = calendar.getActualMinimum(Calendar.MONTH);
        int minWeekOfYear = calendar.getActualMinimum(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR);  // Note: Week of year can vary
        int minDayOfMonth = calendar.getActualMinimum(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);
        int minDayOfYear = calendar.getActualMinimum(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR); // Added for completeness

        // Output the minimum values
        System.out.println("Minimum Year: " + minYear);
        System.out.println("Minimum Month (0-indexed): " + minMonth); // January is 0
        System.out.println("Minimum Week of Year: " + minWeekOfYear);
        System.out.println("Minimum Day of Month: " + minDayOfMonth);
         System.out.println("Minimum Day of Year: " + minDayOfYear);

        // Clarify the meaning of minimum week of year (it can depend on Calendar rules)
        System.out.println("Note: Minimum Week of Year may vary based on Calendar rules (first week containing Jan 1st, etc.).");



        // Example to show how the "minimal" week of year might appear:
        calendar.set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.JANUARY); // set to January
        calendar.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1);       // set to 1st day of January
        int weekOfYearForJan1st = calendar.get(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR);
        System.out.println("Week of Year for January 1st of this year: " + weekOfYearForJan1st);

    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Output:**  The output now explicitly states that the minimum month is 0-indexed (January = 0) and includes explanatory notes about the week of year.

2. **Illustrative Example:** The code now includes a small example that sets the calendar to January 1st of the current year and gets the week of year.  This demonstrates why the `minWeekOfYear` might not always be 1 (it depends on how the calendar defines the first week of the year).

3. **Added `minDayOfYear`:** For completeness, the code also gets and prints the minimum day of the year.  This will always be 1.

4. **`getActualMinimum()`:**  Uses `getActualMinimum()` which is the correct way to get the minimum value for a field, as it accounts for calendar-specific rules.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `MinimumCalendarValues.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.  Compile using `javac MinimumCalendarValues.java`.
3. **Run:** Run the compiled code using `java MinimumCalendarValues`.
