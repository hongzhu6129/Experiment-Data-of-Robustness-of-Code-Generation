```java
import java.util.Calendar;

public class MinimumDateValues {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();

        // Get the minimum values for year, month, week of year, and day of month
        int minYear = calendar.getActualMinimum(Calendar.YEAR);
        int minMonth = calendar.getActualMinimum(Calendar.MONTH);
        int minWeekOfYear = calendar.getActualMinimum(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR);
        int minDayOfMonth = calendar.getActualMinimum(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);

        System.out.println("Minimum Year: " + minYear);
        System.out.println("Minimum Month (0-indexed): " + minMonth);
        System.out.println("Minimum Week of Year: " + minWeekOfYear);
        System.out.println("Minimum Day of Month: " + minDayOfMonth);

        // Demonstrate how to set the Calendar to these minimums
        calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, minYear);  // Would only be relevant if you could go back in time below Java epoch
        calendar.set(Calendar.MONTH, minMonth);
        calendar.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, minDayOfMonth); // Sets to the 1st

         // Note that setting WEEK_OF_YEAR directly might not work as expected.

         System.out.println("Calendar set to minimums (month and day only, year is epoch): " + calendar.getTime());


    }
}
```


Key improvements/explanations:

* **Clarity and Explanation:** Added comments to explain the purpose of each line and the 0-based indexing of the month.  Also, explained why setting YEAR to the actual minimum likely has no effect (unless you're working with dates before the Java epoch).
* **Demonstration:**  Showed how you could actually *use* the minimum values to set the `Calendar` object.
* **`getActualMinimum()`:** Used the correct `getActualMinimum()` method of the `Calendar` class to get the minimum possible values for the specified fields.  These minimum values are context-dependent (e.g., the minimum day of the month depends on the month and year).
* **Output Formatting:**  Improved the output format to make it clear what each value represents.
* **`getTime()`:** Included `calendar.getTime()` to demonstrate the effect of setting the calendar fields.  This prints the date in a human-readable format.
* **`WEEK_OF_YEAR` Clarification:** Added a note explaining why setting `WEEK_OF_YEAR` directly might not have the desired result and is typically less useful.


This revised answer is more complete, well-explained, and demonstrates how to use the obtained minimum values.
