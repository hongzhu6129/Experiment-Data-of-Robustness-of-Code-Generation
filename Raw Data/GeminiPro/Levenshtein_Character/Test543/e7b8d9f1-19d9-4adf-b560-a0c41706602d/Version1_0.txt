```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Example usage: Read an integer
        System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
        int num = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println("You entered: " + num);

        // Example usage: Read a line of text
        scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline left-over
        System.out.print("Enter a line of text: ");
        String line = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println("You entered: " + line);

        // Example usage: Read a double
        System.out.print("Enter a double: ");
        double decimal = scanner.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("You entered: " + decimal);


        scanner.close(); // Close the scanner when done
    }
}
```


This code demonstrates how to read different types of input from the console within the `main` method.  Key points:

* **Scanner:** The `Scanner` class is used to read input.
* **System.in:**  This represents the standard input stream (the console).
* **Methods:**  `nextInt()`, `nextLine()`, `nextDouble()`, etc., are used to read specific data types.
* **Prompts:**  `System.out.print()` is used to display prompts to the user.
* **Closing the Scanner:**  `scanner.close()` is important to release resources.
* **Handling newline:** After using `nextInt()` or `nextDouble()`, you often need `scanner.nextLine()` to consume the remaining newline character before reading a line with `nextLine()`.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Main.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac Main.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code with: `java Main`

You'll then be prompted to enter the different types of input in the console.


This provides a basic framework for reading console input in your Java programs.  You can adapt and extend this to handle different input scenarios and data types as needed.
