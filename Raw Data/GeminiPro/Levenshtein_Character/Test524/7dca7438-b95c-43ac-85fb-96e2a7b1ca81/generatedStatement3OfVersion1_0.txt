2. **Negative Numbers:** The `isCube` method now correctly handles negative numbers. The cube of a negative number is also negative.

3. **Zero:**  Handles the case where the input is zero explicitly.

4. **Cube Root Calculation:** Calculates the cube root using `Math.cbrt()`.

5. **Verification:** Checks if the cube of the calculated cube root is equal to the original number. This ensures accuracy, especially for larger numbers.

6. **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling for non-integer input using a `try-catch` block.

7. **Efficiency (for large numbers - optional):** If you are dealing with extremely large numbers where `Math.cbrt()` might have precision issues, you could consider using a binary search approach to find the cube root instead.


**How to Compile and Run (Command Line):**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CubeChecker.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile: `javac CubeChecker.java`
3. **Run:**  `java CubeChecker 8` (replace 8 with the number you want to check)
