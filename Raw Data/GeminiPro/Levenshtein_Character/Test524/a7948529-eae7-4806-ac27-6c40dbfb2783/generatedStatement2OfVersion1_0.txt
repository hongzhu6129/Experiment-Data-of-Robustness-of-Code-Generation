**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The original prompt didn't specify how to handle negative numbers.  This code now correctly identifies negative perfect cubes (e.g., -8).

2. **Uses `Math.cbrt()`:**  The most efficient way to calculate the cube root in Java is to use the built-in `Math.cbrt()` function.  This is much better than iterating or guessing.

3. **Clearer Check for Integer Cube Root:**  The code now explicitly casts the cube root to an `int` and checks if the original `double` value is equal to the casted `int` value.  This is a reliable way to determine if the cube root is a whole number.
