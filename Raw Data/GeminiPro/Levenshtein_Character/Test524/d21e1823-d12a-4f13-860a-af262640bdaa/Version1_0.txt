```java
public class CubeChecker {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Input handling (assuming input is provided as a command-line argument)
        if (args.length == 0) {
            System.out.println("Please provide a number as a command-line argument.");
            return;
        }

        try {
            int number = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
            checkCube(number);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.");
        }
    }

    private static void checkCube(int number) {
        int cubeRoot = Math.round(Math.cbrt(number)); // Calculate the cube root and round to the nearest integer

        if (cubeRoot * cubeRoot * cubeRoot == number) {
            System.out.println("Number is a cube.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number is not a cube.");
        }
    }
}



```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Input Handling:** The code now checks if a command-line argument is provided. If not, it prints a helpful message and exits gracefully.  It also includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the input is not a valid integer.
2. **Cube Root Calculation:** It uses `Math.cbrt()` to calculate the cube root directly. This is more efficient and accurate than iterating through possible cube roots.
3. **Rounding:** `Math.round()` is used to round the cube root to the nearest integer. This addresses the issue of floating-point precision when dealing with cube roots of large numbers.
4. **Clear Output:** The output messages are more informative ("Number is a cube" or "Number is not a cube").
5. **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block prevents the program from crashing if the user enters non-numeric input.


**How to run from the command line:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CubeChecker.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:
   ```bash
   javac CubeChecker.java
   ```
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with the number you want to check as a command-line argument:
   ```bash
   java CubeChecker 8 
   ```
   Replace `8` with any other integer you want to test.
