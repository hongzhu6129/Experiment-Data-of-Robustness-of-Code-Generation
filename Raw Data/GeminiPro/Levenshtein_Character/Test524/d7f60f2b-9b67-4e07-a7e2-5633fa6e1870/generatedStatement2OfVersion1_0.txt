Key improvements in this version:

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The code now correctly checks if negative numbers are perfect cubes.
2. **Efficiency:** Instead of iterating through all numbers up to `num`, the loop now stops when `i * i * i` exceeds `num`. This significantly improves performance, especially for larger numbers.  We only need to check up to the potential cube root's maximum value.
3. **Clearer Output:**  The output messages are more informative ("number is a cube" or "number is not a cube").
4. **Helper Function:** The `isCube` function makes the code more organized and reusable.


Example Usage (with user input - you'd have to modify the `main` method for this if required):
