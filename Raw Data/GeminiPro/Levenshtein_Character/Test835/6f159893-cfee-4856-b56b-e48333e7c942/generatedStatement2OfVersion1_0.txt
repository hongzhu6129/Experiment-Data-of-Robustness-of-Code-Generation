This improved version:

* **Uses nested loops for cleaner structure:**  Makes the code more readable and easier to understand.
* **Handles star spacing correctly:**  Adds an extra space on even rows of stars to align them properly, creating the offset pattern of the US flag.
* **Prints the correct number of stripes and their lengths.**
* **Prints the correct size for the red section.**
* **Uses `System.out.print()` and `System.out.println()` appropriately:**  Ensures correct formatting of the output.

This code provides a text-based representation of the American flag using asterisks and equal signs.  Obviously, it can't reproduce the colors, but it captures the essential pattern.
