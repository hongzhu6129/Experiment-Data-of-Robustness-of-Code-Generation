**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Command-Line Arguments:**  The code now checks if two command-line arguments are provided. It uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters non-numeric input. This is robust error handling.

2. **Hardcoded Values:** If you don't want to use command-line arguments, you can hardcode the numbers directly into the `main` method, as shown in the example.

3. **User Input (within main):** I've added a more robust way to handle user input directly within `main`.  It uses a `Scanner` and now includes input validation to ensure the user enters valid numbers (using `hasNextDouble()`). This prevents the program from crashing due to invalid input.

4. **Clearer Output:** The output messages are more informative, making it easier to understand the results.

5. **Comments:** Added more comments to explain the code sections.

**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SumTwoNumbers.java`.

2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac SumTwoNumbers.java`

3. **Run (with command-line arguments):**  `java SumTwoNumbers 15 20` (replace 15 and 20 with your desired numbers)


4. **Run (without command-line arguments, using hardcoded/input values):** `java SumTwoNumbers` - the program will then use the hardcoded values and also prompt for user input.
