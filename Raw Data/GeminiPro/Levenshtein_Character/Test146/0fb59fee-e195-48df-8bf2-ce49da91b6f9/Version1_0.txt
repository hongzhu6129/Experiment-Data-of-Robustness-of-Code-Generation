```java
public class StringFromCharArray {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a character array
        char[] chars = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};

        // Create a String object from the character array
        String str = new String(chars);

        // Print the String object
        System.out.println(str);
    }
}
```

**Test cases:**

* **Normal case:** The character array contains valid characters and the String object is created successfully.
* **Empty character array:** The character array is empty and the String object is created as an empty string.
* **Null character array:** The character array is null and a NullPointerException is thrown.
* **Character array with special characters:** The character array contains special characters, such as spaces, tabs, and newlines. The String object is created with these special characters included.
