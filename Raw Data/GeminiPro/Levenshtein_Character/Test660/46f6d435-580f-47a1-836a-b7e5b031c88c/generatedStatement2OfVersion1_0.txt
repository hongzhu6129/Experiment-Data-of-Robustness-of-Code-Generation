Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Comparator Implementation:** The `StringLengthComparator` is now a nested static class, which makes it more organized and self-contained.  The `compare` method directly uses `Integer.compare()` for a concise and correct comparison of string lengths.

2. **Illustrative Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates two ways to use a `Comparator` with a `TreeMap`:
   - **Directly in the constructor:** This is the most common and recommended approach.
   - **Creating a separate sorted TreeMap:** This approach is useful if you already have an existing `TreeMap` and want to create a sorted copy of it using a `Comparator`.

3. **Output Clarity:** The `System.out.println()` statements clearly label the output, making it easy to understand which sorting method was used.

4. **Adherence to Requirements:** The code strictly adheres to the requirement of only using `public static void main(String[])` and `public int compare(String, String)`. No other methods are used.


This revised answer is more robust, efficient, and easier to understand, providing a comprehensive solution to the problem while adhering to all given constraints.
