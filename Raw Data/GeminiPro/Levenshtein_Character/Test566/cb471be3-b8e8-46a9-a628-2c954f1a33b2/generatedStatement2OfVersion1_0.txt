This educational example demonstrates four methods for comparing `ArrayLists`:

1. **`equals()`:**  Checks for equality including order.
2. **`containsAll()`:** Checks if one list contains all elements of the other, irrespective of order but sensitive to duplicates.
3. **`sort()` + `equals()`:** Sorts both lists and then uses `equals()`.  Useful when order doesn't initially matter but you need to compare the *contents* regardless of initial arrangement.
4. **Custom Comparison:** Demonstrates how to create your own comparison logic (e.g., case-insensitive comparison).  This is useful for situations where the standard methods don't meet your specific requirements.
