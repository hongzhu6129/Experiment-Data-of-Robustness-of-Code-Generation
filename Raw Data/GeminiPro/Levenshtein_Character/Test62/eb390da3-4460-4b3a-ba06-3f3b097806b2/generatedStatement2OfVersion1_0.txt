**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Nulls:** The code now explicitly checks for `null` strings to avoid `NullPointerExceptions`.  This is important for robust code.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `firstChar` and `lastChar` makes the code easier to understand.

3. **Simplified String Concatenation:** Uses `String.valueOf()` for a cleaner way to combine the characters into a string.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The test cases cover:
   - Normal strings
   - Empty strings
   - `null` strings
   - Single-character strings
   - Longer strings


**Key Corner Cases Covered:**

* **Empty Strings:**  The logic handles empty strings correctly, substituting `#` as needed.
* **Null Strings:** The code now handles `null` inputs gracefully.
* **Single Character Strings:** The logic works correctly even if one or both strings have only one character.




This improved version is more robust, easier to read, and thoroughly tested.  It addresses the original prompt's requirements and provides better error handling.
