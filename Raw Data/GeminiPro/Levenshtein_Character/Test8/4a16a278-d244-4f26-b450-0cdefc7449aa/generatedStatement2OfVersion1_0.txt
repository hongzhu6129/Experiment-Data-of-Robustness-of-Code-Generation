Key Improvements and Explanations:

* **JUnit Tests:** The code now includes comprehensive JUnit tests to verify the `getArea()` and `getPerimeter()` methods.  This is crucial for robust code.
* **Corner Cases:**  The tests cover important corner cases:
    * Zero length and/or width.
    * Large numbers (checking for potential overflow).
    * Very small numbers (close to zero).
* **Exception Handling (Recommended):** The code is now set up to *expect* `IllegalArgumentException` if negative length or width are provided. This makes the code more robust.  I highly recommend adding the exception throwing logic to the `Rectangle` class itself:
