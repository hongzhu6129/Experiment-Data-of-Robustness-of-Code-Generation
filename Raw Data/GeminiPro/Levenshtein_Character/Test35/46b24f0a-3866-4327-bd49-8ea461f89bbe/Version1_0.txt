```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AsciiValue {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a character: ");
        String input = scanner.nextLine();

        if (input.length() != 1) {
            System.out.println("Please enter a single character.");
            return; // Exit if input is not a single character
        }

        char character = input.charAt(0);
        int asciiValue = (int) character;

        System.out.println("The ASCII value of '" + character + "' is: " + asciiValue);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

1. **Basic Character:**
   - Input: `A`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of 'A' is: 65`

2. **Lowercase Character:**
   - Input: `a`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of 'a' is: 97`

3. **Digit:**
   - Input: `7`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of '7' is: 55`

4. **Special Character:**
   - Input: `$`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of '$' is: 36`

5. **Space:**
   - Input: ` ` (a space)
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of ' ' is: 32`

6. **Extended ASCII Character (e.g., accented characters - depends on encoding):**
   - Input: `�`
   - Expected Output:  The output might vary depending on your system's encoding (e.g., 130 for CP1252, 233 for UTF-8). It's good practice to use UTF-8 if you're working with international characters.

7. **Empty Input:**
   - Input: "" (nothing entered)
   - Expected Output: `Please enter a single character.`

8. **Multiple Characters:**
   - Input: `abc`
   - Expected Output: `Please enter a single character.`

9. **Control Character (e.g., Tab):**
    - Input:  `\t` (Press the Tab key) �  The Scanner class usually handles this by reading the whole line including escape sequences.
    - Expected Output: `Please enter a single character.` (Because  `\t` is considered a single string representing the tab character, but we only want a single character without escape sequence interpretation.)

10. **Null Character:**
    -  You can't directly enter a null character ('\0') through the console. If you try to assign it programmatically within the code (e.g. `char character = '\0';`), it will give you an ASCII value of 0.


**Explanation of Corner Cases:**

* **Empty and Multiple Characters:** These are handled by the `if` condition to ensure the program operates correctly only with single-character input.
* **Extended ASCII:**  Handles characters outside the basic ASCII range (0-127), which are represented differently depending on the character encoding.
* **Control Characters:** Addresses how the program should behave if the user enters a control character like Tab or Enter.
* **Null Character:** Explains why direct input of the null character via console isn't possible and what happens if you set it in your code directly.


This comprehensive set of test cases helps you verify the correctness and robustness of your `AsciiValue` program by covering a variety of scenarios, including edge cases. Remember to consider character encoding, especially if you are working with international characters. It is strongly recommended to use UTF-8 encoding for modern Java applications.
