Explanation:

1. **Create a LinkedList:**  The code starts by creating a `LinkedList` of strings called `fruits` and adds some sample elements.

2. **Element to Search:**  The `searchElement` variable stores the value we want to find in the list.

3. **Method 1: `contains()` (Most Efficient):** The `contains()` method is the simplest and most efficient way to check if an element exists in a `LinkedList`. It returns `true` if the element is found, and `false` otherwise.

4. **Method 2: Manual Iteration (Educational):** This method iterates through the `LinkedList` using a for-each loop.  It compares each element in the list with the `searchElement`. If a match is found, the `found` flag is set to `true`, and the loop is terminated using `break` to improve efficiency. This method is primarily for educational purposes to show how to traverse a LinkedList manually.

5. **Method 3: `indexOf()` (Alternative Approach):**  The `indexOf()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in the list. If the element is not found, it returns -1.  This method can be used to check for existence as well as find the position of the element.

6. **Handling Element Not Found:** Shows how to use an `if-else` statement to handle cases where the element you are searching for is not in the LinkedList.

7. **Handling Null List:**  Demonstrates a critical check to prevent `NullPointerException` if the LinkedList itself is `null`.  Always check for `null` before attempting to use methods on a potentially null object.


This educational example provides multiple ways to check for element existence in a `LinkedList` and also covers important aspects of handling null values and not-found cases, making it more robust and suitable for beginners.
