**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The provided evaluation method within `polyEval` directly implements Horner's method (also known as Horner's rule or Horner's scheme), which is the most efficient way to evaluate polynomials. It minimizes the number of multiplications required.

2. **Clarity and Comments:**  The code includes comments to explain the purpose of each part, making it easier to understand. The example usage in `main` clearly demonstrates how to use the `polyEval` method.

3. **Generality:** The code works for polynomials of any degree (including constant polynomials).  You simply provide the coefficients in the `List<Double>`.

4. **Error Handling (Optional):** While not strictly required by the prompt, consider adding error handling to `polyEval`.  For example, you could check if the `coefficients` list is null or empty:
