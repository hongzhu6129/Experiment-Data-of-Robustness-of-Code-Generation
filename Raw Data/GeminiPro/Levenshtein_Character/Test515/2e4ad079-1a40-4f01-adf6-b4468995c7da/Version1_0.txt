Here's how the code works, respecting the specified method signatures:

1. **`main` method:**
   - Initializes a `count` to keep track of how many happy numbers have been found.
   - Starts a `while` loop that continues until 10 happy numbers are found.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `happy_num` to check if the current number (`num`) is happy.
   - If `happy_num` returns `true`, it prints the number and increments the `count`.
   - Increments `num` to check the next number.

2. **`happy_num` method:**
   - Takes a `long` `num` as input.
   - Uses a `HashSet` called `seen` to store numbers encountered during the process. This prevents infinite loops for non-happy numbers.
   - Enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `num` is not 1 and `num` has not been seen before.
   - Inside the loop:
     - Adds the current `num` to the `seen` set.
     - Calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of `num`.
     - Updates `num` to the calculated sum.
   - After the loop, returns `true` if `num` is 1 (meaning it's a happy number), and `false` otherwise.


This revised version efficiently detects happy numbers and adheres to the given method signature constraints.
