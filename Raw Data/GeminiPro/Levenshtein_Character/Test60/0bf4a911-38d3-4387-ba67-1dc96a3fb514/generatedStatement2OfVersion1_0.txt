**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The `concatenateStrings` method now throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if either string is `null` or has a length less than 1.  This makes the function more robust.

2. **JUnit Tests:** The code now includes JUnit tests. This is crucial for verifying the correctness of the function, especially for handling edge cases.  The test cases cover:
   - Normal concatenation
   - Single-character strings (a corner case)
   - Various invalid inputs (nulls, empty strings)

3. **Clearer Main Method:** The `main` method demonstrates a few example usages of the function, including the corner case of single-character strings.

4. **Conciseness:** The code is now a bit more concise while remaining readable.

**How to Run the Tests:**

If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you should be able to right-click on the test class or methods and select "Run".  If you're using the command line:

1. Make sure you have JUnit 5 on your classpath.
2. Compile the code: `javac StringConcatenation.java`
3. Run the tests: `java -cp .:junit-platform-console-standalone-<version>.jar org.junit.platform.console.ConsoleLauncher --select-class StringConcatenation` (replace `<version>` with the JUnit version you're using).




This improved version provides better error handling, comprehensive testing, and is generally more robust and professional.
