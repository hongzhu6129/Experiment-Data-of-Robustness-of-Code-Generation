Key improvements in this version:

* **Uses `java.time`:**  The modern Java date/time API is used (specifically `YearMonth`, `LocalDate`, and `DateTimeFormatter`), which is much preferred over older classes like `Calendar` and `Date`.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  More descriptive variable names improve readability.
* **Optional Formatting:** The `DateTimeFormatter` is used to format the output nicely, making it easier to read.
* **Example with User Input:** Demonstrates how to accept year and month from command-line arguments. Basic error handling (using `try-catch`) is included for the number parsing.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the different sections of the code.


To compile and run from the command line:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FirstAndLastDayOfMonth.java`.
2. **Compile:** `javac FirstAndLastDayOfMonth.java`
3. **Run (current date):** `java FirstAndLastDayOfMonth`
4. **Run (specific year/month):** `java FirstAndLastDayOfMonth 2024 2` (for February 2024)


This improved version provides a more robust and modern solution to the problem of getting the first and last day of a month in Java.
