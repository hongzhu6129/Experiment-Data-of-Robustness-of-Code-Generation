            } catch (Exception e) {
                // Handle potential DateTimeException (e.g., week 53 might not exist in some years)
                // We just break the loop if a week is invalid for the current year/locale

Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles Locale:** Uses `WeekFields.of(Locale.getDefault())` to ensure the code works correctly in different regions where the first day of the week might not be Monday.
* **Handles 53rd Week Correctly:**  The `try-catch` block prevents the code from crashing if the 53rd week doesn't exist in the current year/locale.  It gracefully stops calculating weeks when it encounters an invalid week number.
* **Clearer Output:**  The output is formatted to show "Week X: StartDate - EndDate".
* **More Efficient:**  Calculating the last day of the week by adding 6 days to the first day is more efficient than using another `with()` and `TemporalAdjuster`.


Example Output (will vary depending on the current date and locale):

```
Week 1: 2024-01-01 - 2024-01-07
Week 2: 2024-01-08 - 2024-01-14
Week 3: 2024-01-15 - 2024-01-21
...
Week 52: 2024-12-23 - 2024-12-29
Week 53: 2024-12-30 - 2025-01-05 // Example, may vary depending on the year
```
