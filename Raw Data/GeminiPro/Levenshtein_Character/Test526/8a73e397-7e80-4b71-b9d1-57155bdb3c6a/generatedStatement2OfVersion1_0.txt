**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`calculateFermatNumber(int n)` Method:** This helper method calculates the Fermat number for a given `n`.  It uses `Math.pow()` to perform the exponentiation. The result is cast to `long` because Fermat numbers grow very quickly.

2. **Main Loop:** The `main` method iterates from `n = 0` to `n = 9` (inclusive) to calculate and print the first 10 Fermat numbers.

3. **Long Data Type:**  Using `long` allows us to represent larger Fermat numbers than `int` would, but even `long` will overflow for Fermat numbers beyond F5 (when n=5 and above).

4. **BigInteger (for larger values of n - beyond the scope of the prompt, but essential for correctness):**  For truly handling Fermat numbers correctly (without overflow), you would need to use `BigInteger` because they can grow arbitrarily large:
