```java
public class FermatNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("First 10 Fermat Numbers:");

        for (int n = 0; n < 10; n++) {
            long fermatNumber = calculateFermatNumber(n);
            System.out.println(fermatNumber);
        }
    }

    private static long calculateFermatNumber(int n) {
        return (long) (Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, n)) + 1);
    }
}
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`calculateFermatNumber(int n)` Method:** This helper method encapsulates the Fermat number calculation.  It uses `Math.pow()` to compute 2^(2^n) and then adds 1. The result is cast to `long` because Fermat numbers grow very quickly and exceed the capacity of `int` even for small values of `n`.

2. **Loop for First 10 Numbers:** The `main` method now has a simple `for` loop that iterates from `n = 0` to `n = 9` (inclusive) to calculate and print the first 10 Fermat numbers.

3. **Output Clarity:**  The output includes a header "First 10 Fermat Numbers:" to make the results clear.

4. **Long Data Type:**  Using `long` instead of `int` is crucial.  Even the 6th Fermat number exceeds the maximum value of an `int`. However, be aware that even `long` will not be able to store Fermat numbers beyond the first few because they grow so rapidly.  For larger Fermat numbers, you would need to use `BigInteger` (if you need precise representations).



**Example Output:** (The later numbers will exceed the `long` limit)
