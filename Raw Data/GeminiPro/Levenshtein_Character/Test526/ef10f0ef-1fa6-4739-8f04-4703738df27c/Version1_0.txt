```java
public class DiophantineNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Diophantine numbers are numbers that can be expressed as the difference of two perfect squares.
        //  n = a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)
        //  If we let a-b = 1, then a+b = n, so a = (n+1)/2 and b = (n-1)/2.
        //  Thus, any odd number greater than 1 is a Diophantine number.

        //  If we let a-b = 2, then a+b = n/2, so a = (n/2 + 2)/2 = (n+4)/4 and b = (n-4)/4
        //  Thus, any number divisible by 4, n, where n > 4 is also Diophantine.

        // A more efficient way to generate is to iterate through odd and multiples of 4

        int count = 0;
        int num = 3; // Start with the first odd number greater than 1

        while (count < 10) {
            if (num % 2 != 0 || num % 4 == 0) {
                System.out.println(num);
                count++;
            }
            num++;
        }

    }
}
```


Output of this code will be the first 10 Diophantine numbers:

```
3
4
5
7
8
9
11
12
13
15
```


**Important Note:** The prompt mentions Fermat numbers, but asks for Diophantine numbers.  The question body also has a series of floating-point numbers (3.0, 5.0, etc.) that seem unrelated to either Diophantine or Fermat numbers. This solution focuses on generating Diophantine numbers as clearly requested in the main prompt and provides an explanation of their mathematical properties.   If you actually wanted Fermat numbers, the logic in `main` would need to be completely different.  If you need code to generate Fermat numbers instead, please clarify.
