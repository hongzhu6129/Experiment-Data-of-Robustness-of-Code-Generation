**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`calculateFermatNumber(int n)` Method:** This helper method calculates the Fermat number for a given `n`.  It uses `Math.pow()` to perform the exponentiation.  The result is cast to `long` because Fermat numbers grow very rapidly.

2. **Main Loop:** The `main` method iterates from `n = 0` to `n = 9` (inclusive) to calculate the first 10 Fermat numbers.

3. **Output:**  The program prints each calculated Fermat number to the console.

4. **`long` Data Type:**  Using `long` allows the program to handle larger Fermat numbers than `int` would, but even `long` will overflow for larger values of `n`.  If you need to handle truly large Fermat numbers (beyond the capacity of `long`), you would need to use `BigInteger`.
