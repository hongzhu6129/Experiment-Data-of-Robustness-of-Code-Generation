This code addresses the overflow issue by using `long` to store the Fermat numbers. While `long` can hold larger values than `int`, it still has limitations.  Fermat numbers grow very rapidly, so even `long` will overflow beyond the first few.  If you need to calculate even larger Fermat numbers, you'll need to use `BigInteger`.

Here's the version using `BigInteger` if you're interested:
