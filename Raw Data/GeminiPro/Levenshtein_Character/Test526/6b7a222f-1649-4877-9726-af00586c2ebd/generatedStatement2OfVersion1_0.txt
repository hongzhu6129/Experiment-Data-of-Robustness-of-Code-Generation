**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Data Type:** Fermat numbers grow very quickly.  Even the 6th Fermat number exceeds the maximum value that an `int` can hold. Therefore, we use `long` to store the calculated Fermat numbers. This will handle the first few Fermat numbers correctly. However, for even larger values of `n`, you would eventually exceed the capacity of `long` as well and need to use `BigInteger`.

2. **Explicit Casting:** `Math.pow()` returns a `double`.  Because we're working with integers, we need to cast the result of `Math.pow()` to `long`.  The `(long)` casts the `double` to `long`.

3. **Clarity and Readability:** The code includes comments and descriptive variable names to enhance readability.  It also prints a clear message indicating what the output represents.

4. **Efficiency (for larger n, beyond what `long` can handle):**  For very large values of `n`, using `BigInteger` is essential.  `BigInteger` allows representing arbitrarily large integers. Here's a version using `BigInteger`:
