   This version uses `BigInteger`'s `pow()` method for exponentiation and `add()` for addition, ensuring accurate results for much larger Fermat numbers. The `intValueExact()` method is used to convert the BigInteger exponent to an int, ensuring that no precision is lost in the conversion.  This conversion is necessary because the BigInteger.pow() method requires an integer exponent, not another BigInteger.


This improved code handles potential overflow and gives you precise Fermat numbers for a wider range of inputs.  The first version (using `long`) is simpler for smaller Fermat numbers, while the `BigInteger` version is necessary for larger values.
