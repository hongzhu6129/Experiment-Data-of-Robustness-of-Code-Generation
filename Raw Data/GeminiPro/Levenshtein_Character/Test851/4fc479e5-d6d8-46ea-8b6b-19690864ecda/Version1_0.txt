**Explanation and Different Swap Approaches**

This code demonstrates swapping using a temporary variable, which is the most common and straightforward method.  The variables are swapped in pairs (a with g, b with f, and c with e).  `d` remains in its original position.

While there are other swap techniques (like using arithmetic operations for numeric types), they are less readable and can lead to overflow issues, so using a `temp` variable is generally preferred.


**Within main() limitations:**

The requirement to use only `public static void main(String[] args)` makes it challenging to demonstrate more complex swapping arrangements or use more object-oriented approaches.  If you had more flexibility, you could:

* **Create a separate swap method:**  This would improve code organization and reusability.
* **Use an array:** Swapping elements in an array allows for more dynamic and generalized swapping logic.
* **Create a class:**  If you were dealing with more complex objects than primitive types, a class would be a more structured way to handle the data and swapping operations.


However, within the constraints of the `main` method only, the provided code demonstrates the core concept of swapping variables effectively.
