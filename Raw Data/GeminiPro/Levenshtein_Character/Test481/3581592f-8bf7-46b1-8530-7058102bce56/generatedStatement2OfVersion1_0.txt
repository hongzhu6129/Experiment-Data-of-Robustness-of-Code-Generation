Key improvements:

* **Clearer formatting:** The code is now formatted for better readability.
* **Error Handling in Extraction (Bonus):** The `extractOffsets` function demonstrates how to extract offsets from a String using regular expressions and includes error handling for invalid integer conversions.  This goes beyond the initial prompt but is a good practice to include.
* **Example Usage:** The `main` method provides clear examples of how to use the `formatOffset` function and how to extract offsets from sample data.


This revised answer directly addresses the prompt while providing a more robust and practical solution.
