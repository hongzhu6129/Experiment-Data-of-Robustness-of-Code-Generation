Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Regular Expression:** The regular expression `[a-z]+(_[a-z]+)+|[a-z]+` now effectively handles both sequences of lowercase words joined by underscores AND single lowercase words.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:**  It correctly handles input with only underscores (like `___`) or invalid input without lowercase sequences (like `invalid-input`) returning an empty string as expected.

3. **StringBuilder for Efficiency:**  Using `StringBuilder` is more efficient than repeated string concatenation using `+`.

4. **Trailing Underscore Removal:** The code now uses `replaceAll("_$", "")` to efficiently remove any potential trailing underscores, ensuring clean output.

5. **Detailed Comments:** The code includes comments explaining the regex and the logic, making it easier to understand.

6. **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates various test cases and prints the output, making it clear how the `validate` method works.
