Key improvements:

* **Uses regular expressions:** The `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from `java.util.regex` are used to efficiently find all the numbers in the string, regardless of their position or surrounding characters.  This is much more robust than splitting the string.
* **Handles NumberFormatException:** The `try-catch` block handles the `NumberFormatException` that can occur if the extracted number is too large to be parsed as an `int`.  This prevents the program from crashing and provides a more graceful way to handle such situations. I've included an example in the `main` method (str4) to demonstrate this and have included a comment showing how to use a `long` instead if you expect larger numbers.
* **Clearer variable names:**  More descriptive variable names like `pattern` and `matcher` enhance readability.
* **More test cases:** The `main` method includes several test cases to demonstrate the program's functionality with different input strings, including a string with no numbers and one with very large numbers to show how the exception handling works.



This revised version is more efficient, robust, and readable, making it a much better solution to the problem.
