**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases demonstrating various scenarios including corner cases:

1. **Normal Case:**
   - Input: 5, 3, 2
   - Expected Output: Part average: 1.6666666666666667

2. **Zero Sum in First Two:**
   - Input: 2, -2, 5  (num1 + num2 = 0)
   - Expected Output: Part average cannot be calculated (division by zero).

3. **Zero as Input:**
   - Input: 0, 0, 5
   - Expected Output: Part average cannot be calculated (division by zero).

4. **Negative Numbers:**
   - Input: -5, -3, -2
   - Expected Output: Part average: 1.6666666666666667

5. **Large Numbers:**
   - Input: 1000000, 2000000, 3000000
   - Expected Output: Part average: 2.0

6. **Decimal Numbers:**
   - Input: 2.5, 1.5, 3.0
   - Expected Output: Part average: 1.75

7. **One Zero Input**
   - Input: 5,0,10
   - Expected Output: Part average: 3.0

8. **Two Zero Inputs:**
    - Input: 0, 5, 10
    - Expected Output: Part average: 3.0


These test cases cover a good range of inputs, including potential division by zero errors and different data types (positive, negative, zero, large, decimal). You can add more test cases as needed based on specific requirements. It's always a good idea to thoroughly test your code with diverse inputs to ensure correctness and robustness.
