Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Includes checks for `null` and empty input arrays.
* **Clearer variable naming:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `i` for tracking the position of unique elements.
* **Improved `main` method:**  Provides multiple test cases, including edge cases, and prints the results clearly, showcasing the modified array up to the new length.  Also handles potential `NullPointerException` when printing.
* **Conciseness and Efficiency:**  The core logic remains efficient, using only O(1) extra space as required.



This revised version addresses potential issues and provides a more robust and demonstrable solution.
