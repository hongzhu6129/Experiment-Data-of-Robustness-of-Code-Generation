Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles `DateTimeParseException` to gracefully deal with incorrect date formats entered by the user.  It prints a clear error message.
* **Clearer Prompts:**  The prompt now explicitly states the expected date format.
* **Resource Management:** The `scanner.close()` statement is included to release the `Scanner` resource.
* **ISO 8601 Date Format:** Using `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE` ensures compatibility with the standard date format.
* **Concise Output:** The output is formatted to display the age in years, months, and days.
