```java
public class ExecutionTime {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Record the start time in nanoseconds
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();

        // The code to be measured goes here
        // Example: Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 1000000
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum); // Print the result (optional)


        // More code to be measured could go here...
        String testString = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            testString += "a"; // Simulate some string operations
        }

        // Record the end time in nanoseconds
        long endTime = System.nanoTime();

        // Calculate the elapsed time in nanoseconds
        long elapsedTime = endTime - startTime;

        System.out.println("Execution time in nanoseconds: " + elapsedTime);



    }
}
```


Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer separation of concerns:** The code to be measured is placed within the timing block, making it easy to change or add more code to measure without modifying the timing logic.
* **More realistic example:** The example code now includes a loop and a calculation, which is more representative of real-world code than a simple print statement.
* **Illustrates multiple code blocks:** Demonstrates that you can measure the combined execution time of several pieces of code within the `main` method.
* **Simpler output:** Prints only the execution time, making it easier to analyze the results.





To measure a specific portion of code, enclose it between `startTime` and `endTime`.  For example:

```java
        long startTime2 = System.nanoTime();

        // Code block 2 to measure
         String testString = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            testString += "a"; // Simulate some string operations
        }


        long endTime2 = System.nanoTime();

        long elapsedTime2 = endTime2 - startTime2;
        System.out.println("Execution time of Code block 2 in nanoseconds: " + elapsedTime2);
```
