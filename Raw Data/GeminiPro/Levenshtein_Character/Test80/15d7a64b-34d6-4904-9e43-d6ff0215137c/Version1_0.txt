```java
public class ExecutionTimeMeasurement {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the starting time in nanoseconds (higher precision)
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();

        // Code to be measured
        // Example: calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 1000000
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum); // Print the result (optional)

        // Get the ending time in nanoseconds
        long endTime = System.nanoTime();

        // Calculate the elapsed time in nanoseconds
        long elapsedTimeNano = endTime - startTime;

        // Convert nanoseconds to microseconds
        long elapsedTimeMicro = elapsedTimeNano / 1000;

        System.out.println("Execution time: " + elapsedTimeMicro + " microseconds");


        // Alternative, less precise way using milliseconds:
        long startTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();
        // Your code here... (same code as above)
        long endTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long elapsedTimeMillis = endTimeMillis - startTimeMillis;
        System.out.println("Execution time (milliseconds): " + elapsedTimeMillis +" milliseconds");


    }
}
```


**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Nanosecond Precision:** Using `System.nanoTime()` provides higher precision than `System.currentTimeMillis()`. While the final result is displayed in microseconds, using nanoseconds for measurement ensures greater accuracy, especially for very short execution times.

2. **Clearer Output:** The code now clearly labels the output as "microseconds" to avoid ambiguity.  It also includes an example calculation (sum of numbers) so you can see it in action.

3. **Millisecond alternative shown:** The less precise but sometimes useful millisecond-based timing is included for comparison.

4. **Correct Conversion:**  The nanosecond to microsecond conversion is accurately done by dividing by 1000.


**How to Use:**

1. Replace the example code (calculating the sum) with the code you want to measure.
2. Compile and run the Java program.  The output will show the execution time of your code in microseconds.


**Important Notes:**

* The measured time might vary slightly on each run due to factors like system load, garbage collection, etc.  It's often a good idea to run the code multiple times and take an average.
* For extremely short code segments, the overhead of calling `System.nanoTime()` might be noticeable. In such cases, consider running the code segment multiple times in a loop and dividing the total time by the number of iterations to get a more accurate measurement per iteration.
