**Explanation:**

1. **`removeDuplicates(int[] nums)`:**
   - Handles `null` or empty input arrays gracefully.
   - Initializes `uniqueCount` to 1 (the first element is always unique initially).
   - Iterates through the array, starting from the second element (`i = 1`).
   - If the current element (`nums[i]`) is different from the previous element (`nums[i-1]`), it's a unique element.
   - Copy this unique element to `nums[uniqueCount]` and increment `uniqueCount`.
   - Finally, returns the `uniqueCount`, which represents the updated length of the array without duplicates.

2. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - Demonstrates the function with example arrays.
   - Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange()` to print only the relevant part of the modified array (up to the `newLength`).  The original array is modified in-place, but elements beyond `newLength` are no longer considered part of the unique elements.


**Key Improvements:**

- **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly deals with empty and `null` input arrays.
- **In-place modification:** Modifies the original array directly, saving space.
- **Clearer variable names:**  `uniqueCount` is more descriptive than just `i` or `count`.
- **Detailed comments:** Explains the logic step by step.
- **Comprehensive test cases:** Includes tests with various scenarios, including empty and null arrays.  The output also shows the resulting modified array (the elements up to the new length).
