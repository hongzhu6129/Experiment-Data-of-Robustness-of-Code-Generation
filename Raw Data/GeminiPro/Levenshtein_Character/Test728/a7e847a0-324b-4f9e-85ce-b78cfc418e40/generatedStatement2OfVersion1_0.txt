Key improvements and explanations in this refined version:

1. **Javadoc Documentation:**  Clear Javadoc comments explain the purpose, parameters, and return value of the `binarySearch` method, making it more understandable.

2. **Overflow Prevention:**  The `mid` calculation `int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;` avoids potential integer overflow that could occur with `(low + high) / 2` if `low` and `high` are very large.

3. **Clearer Output:** The `main` method now provides more informative output, clearly indicating whether the target value was found and its index, or if it wasn't found.

4. **Illustrative Examples:** The `main` method includes examples with both a value that exists in the array and one that doesn't, demonstrating the different possible outcomes of the binary search.


This improved version is more robust, well-documented, and provides a better educational experience for understanding binary search in Java.
