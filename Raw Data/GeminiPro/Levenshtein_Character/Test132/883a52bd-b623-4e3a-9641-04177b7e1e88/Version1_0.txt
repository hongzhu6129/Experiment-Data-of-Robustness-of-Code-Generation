    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double piApproximation1 = calculatePi(5); // Up to 1/11
        double piApproximation2 = calculatePi(6); // Up to 1/13

        System.out.println("Approximation 1 (up to 1/11): " + piApproximation1);
        System.out.println("Approximation 2 (up to 1/13): " + piApproximation2);

        double sign = -1.0; 

        for (int i = 1; i < numTerms; i++) {
            double denominator = 2 * i + 1;
             // For terms 1/9, 1/17 etc. the sign remains positive
            if (denominator % 4 == 1 && denominator!=1) { // Check if denominator is a multiple of 4 + 1 and not 1
               sign = 1.0;
            } else if (denominator!=1){  // other than first term &  multiples of 4 + 1, alternate signs
               sign = -1.0;
            }


            sum += sign / denominator;
        }

        return 4 * sum;
    }

```


**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **`calculatePi(int numTerms)` Method:**  This method now takes an integer `numTerms` as input, representing the number of terms to include in the approximation.  This makes the code more flexible and reusable.

2. **Clearer Sign Handling:** The logic for determining the sign (+ or -) of each term is more explicit. The `if (denominator % 4 == 1 && denominator!=1) `condition handles the cases where the sign should be positive for denominators like 9, 17, 25 etc.

3. **Using `1.0`:** The code uses `1.0` and `-1.0` for double precision, as requested.

4. **Output:** The `main` method now calculates and prints the approximations for both 5 terms (up to 1/11) and 6 terms (up to 1/13), making the output more informative.

5. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic clearly.


This improved version addresses the issues in the previous responses and provides a more accurate, readable, and flexible solution to the problem.
