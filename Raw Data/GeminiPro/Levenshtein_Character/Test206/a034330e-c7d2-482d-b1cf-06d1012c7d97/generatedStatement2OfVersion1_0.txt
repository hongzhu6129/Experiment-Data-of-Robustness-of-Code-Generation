Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clear Node Class:** A `Node` class is explicitly defined to represent the structure of a ternary tree node. This makes the code more organized and readable.

2. **Recursive `maxDepth` Function:** The core logic remains recursive.  The base case is when `node` is null (empty subtree), returning 0.  Otherwise, it recursively calculates the depth of the left, mid, and right subtrees, takes the maximum of those, and adds 1 (for the current node's level).

3. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** The `main` method now includes multiple test cases to demonstrate the code's correctness with:
    - A standard ternary tree.
    - An empty tree (null root).
    - A skewed tree (where nodes are primarily along one branch). This ensures the recursion handles unbalanced trees correctly.

4. **Clear Comments:**  Comments are included to explain the purpose of different parts of the code.

5. **Correct Output:**  The provided test cases now produce the expected correct output for the maximum depth.
