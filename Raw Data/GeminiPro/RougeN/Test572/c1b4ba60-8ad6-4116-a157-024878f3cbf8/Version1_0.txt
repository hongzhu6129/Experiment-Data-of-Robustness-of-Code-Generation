```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class TrimArrayListCapacity {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an ArrayList with an initial capacity
        ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>(20); 

        // Add some elements (fewer than the initial capacity)
        numbers.add(1);
        numbers.add(2);
        numbers.add(3);
        numbers.add(4);
        numbers.add(5);


        System.out.println("Initial size: " + numbers.size());
        System.out.println("Initial capacity: " + getCapacity(numbers)); // Using reflection (explained below)


        // Trim the capacity to the current size
        numbers.trimToSize();

        System.out.println("Size after trim: " + numbers.size());
        System.out.println("Capacity after trim: " + getCapacity(numbers)); // Using reflection

    }



    // Helper function to get the capacity (as there's no direct method) using reflection
    //  Reflection is used here to access a private field, which is generally not recommended 
    //  in production code unless absolutely necessary due to its performance implications
    //  and potential fragility.
    private static int getCapacity(ArrayList<?> list) {
        try {
            java.lang.reflect.Field elementDataField = ArrayList.class.getDeclaredField("elementData");
            elementDataField.setAccessible(true); // Make the private field accessible
            Object[] elementData = (Object[]) elementDataField.get(list);
            return elementData.length; 
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle exceptions (e.g., NoSuchFieldException, IllegalAccessException) appropriately in a real app
            e.printStackTrace();
            return -1; // Or throw a custom exception 
        }
    }
}

```


**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **`trimToSize()`:** The core of the solution is the `trimToSize()` method of the `ArrayList` class. This method reduces the capacity of the `ArrayList` to its current size.

2. **Initial Capacity:** The `ArrayList` constructor is used with an initial capacity argument (e.g., 20) to demonstrate how `trimToSize()` works.  We then add fewer elements than the initial capacity.

3. **Getting Capacity (Reflection):**  There's no direct public method to get the capacity of an `ArrayList`. In the example, we use reflection to get the capacity for demonstration purposes.  **Important Note:**  Reflection can have performance implications and is generally not recommended for production code except in rare, necessary cases where no other option is available.

4. **Clearer Output:** The code prints the size and capacity before and after trimming, making it easier to see the effect of `trimToSize()`.

5. **Error Handling (in Reflection):**  The `getCapacity` helper method includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions during reflection.  In a real-world application, you would want to handle these exceptions more robustly (e.g., logging, throwing a custom exception).



**How to Run:**

1. Save the code as `TrimArrayListCapacity.java`.
2. Compile: `javac TrimArrayListCapacity.java`
3. Run: `java TrimArrayListCapacity`


You'll see the output showing the initial capacity, the size after adding elements, and the reduced capacity after calling `trimToSize()`.
