Explanation:

1. **`main` method:**
   - Takes a sample `String` and a `char` for replacement.
   - Calls the `validate` method to perform the vowel replacement.
   - Prints the original and modified strings to the console.
   - Demonstrates how to use it with a double by converting it to a string first.

2. **`validate` method:**
   - Takes the input `String` and the replacement `char` as arguments.
   - Handles `null` input (returns `null` in this case; you can modify it to throw an exception or return an empty string if desired).
   - Iterates through the characters of the input string using a `for-each` loop.
   - Uses a regular expression `[aeiouAEIOU]` to efficiently check if a character is a vowel (case-insensitive).
   - If the character is a vowel, appends the `replacement` character to the `StringBuilder`.
   - Otherwise, appends the original character to the `StringBuilder`.
   - Finally, converts the `StringBuilder` to a `String` and returns it.


Key improvements:

- **Handles `null` input:** More robust.
- **Uses `StringBuilder`:** More efficient for string manipulation, especially with longer strings.
- **Case-insensitive vowel check:** Correctly handles both uppercase and lowercase vowels.
- **Clearer variable names:** Improves readability.
- **Added example with double:** Shows the intended use case.
- **Uses regex for vowel check:** More concise and easier to read than multiple `||` conditions.
