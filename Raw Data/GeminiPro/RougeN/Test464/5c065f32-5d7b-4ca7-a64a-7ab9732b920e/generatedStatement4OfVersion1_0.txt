Key improvements:

* **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles `DateTimeParseException` to gracefully manage invalid input formats, preventing the program from crashing.
* **12-Hour Format:** The code now formats and displays the time in 12-hour format (e.g., "03:30:45 PM") using a `DateTimeFormatter`.
* **Clearer Prompts and Output:**  The prompts and output messages are more user-friendly.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` to release the resource. This is good practice, especially in larger applications.
