```java
public class CombSort {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
        CombSort(arr);
        System.out.println("Sorted array:");
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }

    public static void CombSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int gap = n;
        boolean swapped = true;

        while (gap > 1 || swapped) {
            // Update the gap value
            gap = (int) (gap / 1.3);  // Shrink factor 1.3 is commonly used
            if (gap < 1) {
                gap = 1; // Minimum gap is 1
            }

            swapped = false;

            // Perform comparisons and swaps with the current gap
            for (int i = 0; i < n - gap; i++) {
                if (arr[i] > arr[i + gap]) {
                    swap(arr, i, i + gap);
                    swapped = true; // Indicate that a swap occurred
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private static void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Shrink Factor:** The code uses the commonly recommended shrink factor of 1.3 for calculating the gap.  This value has been empirically shown to be efficient.

2. **Minimum Gap:** The gap is ensured to be at least 1. This ensures that in the final stages, the algorithm functions like a regular bubble sort, catching any remaining small elements out of order.

3. **`swapped` Flag:**  The `swapped` boolean variable is crucial for optimization.  If no swaps occur during a pass, it means the array is already sorted, and the algorithm can terminate early.  This significantly improves performance in cases where the array is nearly sorted.

4. **Clearer Structure and Comments:** The code is well-commented and structured for readability.

5. **Adherence to Method Signatures:** The code adheres strictly to the provided method signatures `CombSort(int[])`, `swap(int[], int, int)`, and `main(String[])`.


This improved version provides a more accurate and efficient implementation of the Comb Sort algorithm while respecting the given constraints.
