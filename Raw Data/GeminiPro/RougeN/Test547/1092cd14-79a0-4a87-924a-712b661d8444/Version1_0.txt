```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadPlainTextFile {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Specify the path to your text file
        String filePath = "path/to/your/file.txt"; // Replace with your file's path

        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line); 
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading the file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation and How to Use:**

1. **Replace `path/to/your/file.txt`:**  The most crucial step is to change  `"path/to/your/file.txt"` to the actual path of the text file you want to read on your computer.  For example:
   - `"C:/Users/YourName/Documents/my_text_file.txt"` (Windows)
   - `"/home/YourName/Documents/my_text_file.txt"` (Linux/macOS)
   - If the file is in the same directory as your Java source code file, you can just use the file name: `"my_text_file.txt"`

2. **Compile and Run:**
   - Save the code as `ReadPlainTextFile.java`.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
   - Compile: `javac ReadPlainTextFile.java`
   - Run: `java ReadPlainTextFile`

3. **Output:** The program will print the contents of your text file to the console, line by line.

4. **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles potential `IOExceptions` that might occur if the file doesn't exist, you don't have permission to read it, or there are other I/O problems.  This is good practice to prevent your program from crashing.

5. **Try-with-resources:** The `try (BufferedReader reader = ...)` syntax is called "try-with-resources".  It automatically closes the `BufferedReader` when the `try` block is finished, even if there are exceptions.  This helps to prevent resource leaks.


**Example `my_text_file.txt` content:**

```
Hello, world!
This is a sample text file.
Let's read it in Java.
```

**Output after running the Java program:**

```
Hello, world!
This is a sample text file.
Let's read it in Java.
```
