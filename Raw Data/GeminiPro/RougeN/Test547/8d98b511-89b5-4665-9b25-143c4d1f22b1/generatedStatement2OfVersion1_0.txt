Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that might occur if the file doesn't exist or there are other reading problems.  This makes the program more robust.

2. **Command-Line Argument:** The program now takes the filename as a command-line argument. This is the standard way to pass input to Java programs and is more flexible than hardcoding the filename. The code checks if a filename is provided and displays usage instructions if not.

3. **Whitespace Handling:** The word counting now uses `line.split("\\s+")` to split the line by any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, etc.), providing a more accurate word count.

4. **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted to be more informative, displaying the filename being analyzed along with the statistics.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ExplainPlainTextFile.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac ExplainPlainTextFile.java`
3. **Run:** Run the program, providing the filename as an argument: `java ExplainPlainTextFile my_text_file.txt`  (Replace `my_text_file.txt` with the actual path to your text file.)
