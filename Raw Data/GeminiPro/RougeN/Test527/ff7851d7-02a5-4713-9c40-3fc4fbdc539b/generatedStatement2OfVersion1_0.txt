Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Efficiency:** The code now avoids redundant calculations by breaking out of loops when the sum of cubes exceeds `n`.  This significantly improves performance, especially for larger values of `n`.

2. **Duplicate Handling (Crucial):** The inner loops use `d < c` and `b < a`. This prevents checking the same combinations of cubes in a different order (e.g., a^3 + b^3 and b^3 + a^3) and efficiently handles duplicates. The additional condition `a != c && a != d && b != c && b!=d` ensures that it's a different way of expressing the sum.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output now prints the number only the first time it's found to be expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.  A `count` variable is used to keep track of multiple representations.

4. **Correctness:** The logic is now accurately finding numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two *different* sets of two cubes.

5. **Ramanujan's Number Example:** The code initializes `n` to 1729, the famous Ramanujan number, as an example. You can easily change this value to test with other ranges.



This revised version provides a much more efficient and correct solution to the Ramanujan number problem within the constraints of a single `main` method.
