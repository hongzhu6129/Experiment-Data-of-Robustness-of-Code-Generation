Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Distinct Pairs:** The code ensures that (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct pairs by starting the inner loops (for `b` and `d`) from `a + 1` and `c + 1` respectively.  This avoids solutions like 1^3 + 1^3 = 1^3 + 1^3 or 1^3 + 2^3 = 2^3 + 1^3, which are not what the problem asks for.

2. **Efficiency Optimizations:** The `break` statements inside the loops significantly improve efficiency.  They prevent unnecessary calculations when it's clear that a sum of cubes will exceed `n`.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly shows the number and its two different representations as sums of cubes.

4. **Correctness:** The added condition `a3 + b3 <= n` ensures we don't consider sums that are greater than `n` and `&& a != c && a != d && b != c && b != d` ensures distinct numbers.


This revised code is more efficient, produces more accurate results, and provides clearer output, making it a better solution to the Ramanujan number problem.
