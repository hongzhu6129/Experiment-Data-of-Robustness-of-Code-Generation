Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Names:** Using more descriptive names like `charCounts` and `firstNonRepeatingChar` improves readability.
* **Helper Function:**  The logic for finding the non-repeating character is extracted into a separate private helper function `findFirstNonRepeatingCharacter()`. This makes `main` cleaner and promotes code reuse.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles the case where there are no non-repeating characters by returning the null character `\0`.  The main method then checks for this null character and prints an appropriate message.
* **Multiple Test Cases within main:**  The `main` method now includes several test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.  This helps verify correctness during development.
* **Comments:**  Comments explain the purpose of key code sections, making the code easier to understand.
* **Efficiency:** The use of a `HashMap` ensures efficient lookups for character counts, providing an overall time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.
