```java
public class FacePrinter {

    public static void printFace() {
        System.out.println("  +\"\"\"\"+");
        System.out.println(" [| o o |]");
        System.out.println("  |  ^  |");
        System.out.println("  | '-' |");
        System.out.println("  +-----+");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printFace();
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

While this program doesn't have inputs to vary,  we can still think about testing from a slightly different perspective.  These aren't traditional "input-output" test cases but rather verifications:

1. **Visual Inspection:** Run the code and visually check if the output matches the intended face design.  This is the primary test for this kind of program.


2. **Character Accuracy:** Examine the output string literals closely.  Ensure that:
   - The correct characters are used (e.g., `"` vs. `'`, correct spacing).
   - There are no extra or missing characters. This could be automated by comparing the output to an expected string literal if you wanted more robust tests. Example below:

   ```java
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
   import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
   import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
   import java.io.PrintStream;

   public class FacePrinterTest {
       @Test
       public void testPrintFace() {
           ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
           System.setOut(new PrintStream(outputStream));

           FacePrinter.printFace();

           String expectedOutput = "  +\"\"\"\"+"+ System.lineSeparator() +
                   " [| o o |]"+ System.lineSeparator() +
                   "  |  ^  |"+ System.lineSeparator() +
                   "  | '-' |"+ System.lineSeparator() +
                   "  +-----+"+ System.lineSeparator();

           assertEquals(expectedOutput, outputStream.toString());
           System.setOut(System.out); // Restore standard output
       }
   }
   ```


3. **Platform Independence (If applicable):** If you intend this code to run on different operating systems, test it on those platforms to ensure consistent output. Line separators might vary (`\n` vs. `\r\n`), so the test case above using `System.lineSeparator()` is important for cross-platform compatibility.

4. **Character Encoding:**  While less likely an issue in this simple case, with more complex output involving special characters, you might consider testing with different character encodings to ensure correct display.


Although the face printer is simple, these testing approaches demonstrate good practice, which is crucial for more complex programs.  The automated test example using JUnit and `ByteArrayOutputStream` shows how you'd start to incorporate more structured testing for even simple output.  This provides a regression safety net as your code evolves.
