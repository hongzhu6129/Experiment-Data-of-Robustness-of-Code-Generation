**Test Cases:**

While this program doesn't have inputs to vary,  we can still think about testing from a slightly different perspective.  These aren't traditional "input-output" test cases but rather verifications:

1. **Visual Inspection:** Run the code and visually check if the output matches the intended face design.  This is the primary test for this kind of program.


2. **Character Accuracy:** Examine the output string literals closely.  Ensure that:
   - The correct characters are used (e.g., `"` vs. `'`, correct spacing).
   - There are no extra or missing characters. This could be automated by comparing the output to an expected string literal if you wanted more robust tests. Example below:
