```java
public class FacePrinter {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printFace();
    }

    public static void printFace() {
        System.out.println("  +\"\"\"\"+ ");
        System.out.println("[| o o |]");
        System.out.println(" |  ^  | ");
        System.out.println(" | '-' | ");
        System.out.println(" +-----+ ");
    }
}
```

**Test Cases (While you can't directly "test" the output visually in a unit test framework, you can verify that the expected strings are printed):**

1. **Standard Case:** (This is primarily what the `main` method does already)  Verify that the `printFace()` method produces the expected face output.  You can achieve this through system output capturing in a testing framework (like JUnit with System.setOut()).

2. **Empty Input/No Input:** (Not applicable here, as the function doesn't take any input).  This case becomes relevant if you were to modify the face based on parameters.  For instance, you might make the face smile or frown based on a boolean input.

3. **Modified Face Features (if applicable):** If your function were designed to change features (like adding a smile, changing eye shape, etc.), you would test those variations. Example (if there were a `printSmilingFace()` method):

```java
// Hypothetical example with a smiling face variation:
public static void printSmilingFace() {
    System.out.println("  +\"\"\"\"+ ");
    System.out.println("[| o o |]");
    System.out.println(" |  ^  | ");
    System.out.println(" |  _  | "); // Smile!
    System.out.println(" +-----+ ");
}

// In a JUnit test (conceptual example - requires JUnit and output capturing):
@Test
public void testSmilingFace() {
    // ... (Output capturing setup)
    printSmilingFace();
    // ... (Assert that the captured output contains the expected smiling face string)
}
```



4. **Unicode/Special Characters (if applicable):** If you were using Unicode characters for fancier eyes or other features, you'd want to ensure that the output is handled correctly across different platforms/consoles.  This can sometimes be tricky and might require specific character encoding settings in your tests.

**How to test output with JUnit (example):**

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class FacePrinterTest {

    @Test
    public void testPrintFace() {
        ByteArrayOutputStream outContent = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        System.setOut(new PrintStream(outContent));

        FacePrinter.printFace();

        String expectedOutput = "  +\"\"\"\"+ \r\n" + // \r\n for Windows line endings
                                "[| o o |] \r\n" +
                                " |  ^  | \r\n" +
                                " | '-' | \r\n" +
                                " +-----+ \r\n";

        assertEquals(expectedOutput, outContent.toString());

        System.setOut(System.out); // Restore standard output
    }
}

```


The most important testing strategy here is to ensure that the exact string representation you intend is being generated by your `printFace()` function (or any variations).  Visual inspection during development is helpful, but the tests ensure your code continues to work correctly as you make changes.
