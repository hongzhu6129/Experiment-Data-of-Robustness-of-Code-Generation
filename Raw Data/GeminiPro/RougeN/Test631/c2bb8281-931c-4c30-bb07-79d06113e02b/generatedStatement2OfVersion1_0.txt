Key improvements in this educational example:

* **Clearer explanations:**  Comments describe each method and its advantages/disadvantages.
* **Three iteration methods:** Demonstrates `Iterator`, `poll()`, and `toArray()` with an enhanced for loop.  This provides a comprehensive view of how to access elements.
* **Preservation of the original PriorityQueue:**  The code now shows how to iterate without modifying the original PriorityQueue using the `Iterator` and `toArray()` approaches.  It also highlights the destructive nature of using `poll()` repeatedly.
* **Emphasis on `toArray(new Integer[0])`:**  Explains that this is the preferred and type-safe way to convert a `PriorityQueue` to an array.
* **Clear output formatting:**  Newlines and labels make the output easier to understand.
* **Demonstration of the effects of different methods:** Shows the state of the original PriorityQueue and the copy after using different iteration techniques.
