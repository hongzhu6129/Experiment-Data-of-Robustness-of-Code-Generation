Explanation of Stooge Sort and the Code:

1. **Stooge Sort Algorithm:**
   - **Base Case:** If the subarray has one or two elements, sort them directly (if needed).
   - **Recursive Step:**
     - Recursively sort the first two-thirds of the array.
     - Recursively sort the last two-thirds of the array.
     - Recursively sort the first two-thirds of the array again (to ensure the largest element is in its correct place).

2. **Code Breakdown:**
   - `stoogeSort(int[] arr)`: This is the main entry point for sorting. It calls the recursive helper function with the initial indices.
   - `stoogeSort(int[] arr, int low, int high)`: The recursive function.
     - **Base Case:** `if (low >= high)`: If `low` is greater than or equal to `high`, the subarray has 0 or 1 element, so it's already sorted.
     - **Swap:** `if (arr[low] > arr[high])`: Swaps the elements at `low` and `high` if they are out of order. This handles the case of a 2-element subarray and also helps in the general sorting process.
     - **Recursive Calls:**
       - `int t = (high - low + 1) / 3;`: Calculates the size of two-thirds of the current subarray.
       - The three recursive calls implement the Stooge Sort algorithm as described above.


3. **Time Complexity:**  Stooge Sort has a very poor time complexity of O(n<sup>(log 3 / log 1.5)</sup>) which is approximately O(n<sup>2.71</sup>).  This is worse than even bubble sort (O(n<sup>2</sup>)).  It's mostly used as a theoretical example and not for practical applications.
