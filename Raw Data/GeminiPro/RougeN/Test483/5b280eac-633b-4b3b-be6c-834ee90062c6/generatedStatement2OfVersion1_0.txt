**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Input and Validation:** The code now takes input from the user using a `Scanner`.  It also includes a check to ensure `year1` is always less than or equal to `year2` by swapping them if necessary. This handles cases where the user enters the years in reverse order.

2. **Calculation Loop:**  A `for` loop iterates from `year1` (inclusive) up to `year2` (exclusive).  For each year, it calls `number_of_days()` to get the number of days in that year and adds it to the `totalDays`.

3. **Clearer Method Names:** `number_of_days` and `is_Leap_Year` are more standard Java naming conventions (camelCase).

4. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` to prevent resource leaks.

5. **Leap Year Logic:** The `is_Leap_Year` method correctly implements the leap year rules.
