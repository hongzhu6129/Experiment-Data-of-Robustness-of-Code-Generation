**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`prime_cell(int i, int j)`:** This method now correctly determines whether both `i` and `j` are prime.  It returns 0 for false (if both are prime) and 1 for true (otherwise).

2. **`isPrime(int num)`:** This helper function efficiently checks if a number is prime.

3. **`main` Method:**
   - Creates the 2D boolean array `a[][]`.
   - Iterates through the array, calling `prime_cell` to set the boolean values.
   - **Clearer Output:** The output now prints the entire 2D array in a formatted way (row by row) and then separately prints the first row to match the sample output you provided.
   - **Example Size:** The `m` variable is set to 3 for the example, but you can easily change it to create different size arrays.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Prime2DArray.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac Prime2DArray.java`
3. **Run:**  `java Prime2DArray`


This improved version will give you the desired output and is more robust and efficient.
