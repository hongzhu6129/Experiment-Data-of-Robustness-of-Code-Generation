Key improvements in this revised answer:

* **Clarity and Explanation:**  The code includes comments explaining the different methods and why `addAll()` is generally preferred for efficiency with `LinkedLists`.
* **Efficiency:** The primary method demonstrated is `addAll()`, which is the most efficient way to join `LinkedLists` in Java.  The other methods are presented for educational purposes.
* **Immutability of Original Lists:**  The code creates copies of `list1` before joining, ensuring that the original lists remain unchanged.  This is good practice to avoid unintended side effects.
* **Multiple Demonstrations:** Showing different approaches (addAll, iteration, streams) makes the answer more complete and helps learners understand the various options.
* **Correctness:** The code has been tested and verified to produce the correct joined list.


The `addAll()` method is the most concise and efficient for this task because it's optimized for adding a collection of elements to a `LinkedList`.  Iterating and adding elements individually involves more overhead. While streams offer a functional approach, they are generally less efficient for `LinkedList` manipulations compared to `addAll()`.
