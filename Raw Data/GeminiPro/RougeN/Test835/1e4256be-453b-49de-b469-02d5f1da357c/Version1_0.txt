```java
public class AmericanFlag {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Star section
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
                System.out.print("* ");
            }
            if (i == 2) {
                System.out.print("pct "); // Placeholder, as "pct" isn't standard flag element
            }
            System.out.print("==");
            for (int j = 0; j < 18; j++) {
                System.out.print("=");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }


        // Stripes section
        for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 30; j++) {
                System.out.print("=");
            }
            System.out.println();

        }
    }
}
```


This code directly addresses the output specified in the prompt.  A few important notes:

* **"pct" Placeholder:**  The original prompt included "pct" in the flag.  Since this isn't a standard part of the US flag, I've included it as a placeholder.  If you intend this to be something else (perhaps an initial or other symbol), you'll need to modify that part of the code.
* **Simplified Output:** The provided output in the prompt doesn't perfectly match the proportions or spacing of a real US flag. This code replicates the output as requested.  For a more realistic flag representation, you'd need a more complex approach, potentially using graphics libraries.
* **No External Libraries:**  This solution adheres to the requirement of using only the `main` method and doesn't rely on any external libraries.


If you want a more accurate or visually appealing flag, consider using graphics libraries like Swing or JavaFX.  Let me know if you have any other requirements!
