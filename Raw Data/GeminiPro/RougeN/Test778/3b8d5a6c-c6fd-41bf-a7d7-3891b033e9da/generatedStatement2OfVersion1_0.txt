This code will produce the desired output, representing an American flag, in the console.  It's structured to clearly separate the star and stripe sections, making it easier to understand and potentially modify if different dimensions are needed.  The `=` character is used to represent the red stripes (since color isn't possible directly in console output), but this could be changed to another character if desired.
