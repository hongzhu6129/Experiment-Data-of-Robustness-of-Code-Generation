Explanation within `main` method limitations:

1. **TreeMap:** We use a `TreeMap` because it automatically stores keys in sorted order, making it efficient to find the least key greater than or equal to a given key.

2. **ceilingKey():**  The `ceilingKey()` method of `TreeMap` directly does what we need.  It returns the least key greater than or equal to the given key, or `null` if there's no such key.

3. **Example:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to create a `TreeMap`, add elements, and use `ceilingKey()` to get the desired result.  The different examples show how it handles various cases, including when the exact key exists, when a larger key exists, and when no larger key exists.

4. **String Keys:**  The example with `stringTreeMap` shows that `TreeMap` can handle String keys as well (or any other comparable type).  The comparison will be based on the natural ordering of Strings (lexicographical order).


Important Notes due to `main` method restriction:

* Error handling (e.g., for invalid input) is minimal in this example for brevity. In a more complete program, you would typically include more robust error handling.
*  More complex scenarios (e.g., handling custom comparison logic) would typically be handled by separate classes/methods, which is not possible within a single `main` method.
