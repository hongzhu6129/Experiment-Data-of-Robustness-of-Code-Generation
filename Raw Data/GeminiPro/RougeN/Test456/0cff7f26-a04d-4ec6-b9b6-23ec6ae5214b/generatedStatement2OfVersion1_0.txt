* **Input Validation:** It now handles potential `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters dates in the wrong format. This makes the program more robust.
* **Clear Error Message:**  Provides a user-friendly error message if the date format is incorrect.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed in a `finally` block to ensure proper resource management.
* **Consistent Formatting:** Uses a `DateTimeFormatter` to ensure consistent date parsing.
* **Clearer Prompts:**  The input prompts are more descriptive, making it easier for the user to understand what's expected.
* **Concise Output:** The output clearly labels the years and months.
