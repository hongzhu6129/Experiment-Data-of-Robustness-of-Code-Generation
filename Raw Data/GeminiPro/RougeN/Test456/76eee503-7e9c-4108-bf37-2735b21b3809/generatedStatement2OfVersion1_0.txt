Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters dates in an incorrect format. This makes the program more robust.

2. **Clear Prompts:**  Added clear prompts to instruct the user on the expected date format.

3. **java.time API:**  Uses the modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8).  It's significantly better than the old `Date` and `Calendar` classes for date/time manipulation.  `LocalDate` is used to represent dates, and `Period` is used to calculate the difference between them.

4. **Formatting:** Uses `DateTimeFormatter` for parsing the date strings into `LocalDate` objects, ensuring that the date format is handled correctly.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DateDifference.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:  `javac DateDifference.java`
3. **Run:**  `java DateDifference`

The program will then prompt you to enter the two dates.
