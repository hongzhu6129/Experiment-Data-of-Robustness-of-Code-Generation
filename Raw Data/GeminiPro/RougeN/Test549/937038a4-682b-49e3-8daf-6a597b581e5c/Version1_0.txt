Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Error Handling:** The `readLinesFromFile` method now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions`.  If there's a problem reading the file (e.g., it doesn't exist), an error message is printed, and `null` is returned to indicate the failure to the `main` method.

2. **ArrayList for Storage:**  An `ArrayList<String>` is used to store the lines. `ArrayList` is a good choice because it dynamically resizes as needed, and provides efficient access to elements.

3. **Clearer Output:** The `main` method now prints a success message if the file is read correctly, making the output more user-friendly.

4. **Resource Management (try-with-resources):** The `BufferedReader` is used inside a try-with-resources block. This ensures that the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed, even if exceptions occur, preventing resource leaks.

5. **Private Helper Method:** The file reading logic is encapsulated in the `readLinesFromFile` method.  This makes the `main` method cleaner and promotes code reusability.


How to use:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StoreTextFileContent.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it:  `javac StoreTextFileContent.java`
3. **Create a Text File:** Create a text file named `your_file.txt` (or whatever name you put in the `filePath` variable) in the same directory as the Java file.  Put some text in the file.
4. **Run:**  Run the compiled code: `java StoreTextFileContent`


The program will output the lines of your text file to the console.  If there are errors (e.g., the file is not found), an appropriate error message will be displayed.
