**Explanation:**

1. **`main` Method:**
   - The `main` method is the entry point of the program.
   - It specifies the file path (`filePath`).  **Make sure to replace `"your_file_path.txt"` with the correct path.**
   - It calls `readLinesFromFile` to get the lines from the file and stores them in a `List<String>`.
   - It then converts the `List` to a `String[]` using `lines.toArray(new String[0])`.
   - Finally, it iterates through the array and prints each line. You can replace the printing part with any other processing you need to do with the lines.

2. **`readLinesFromFile` Method:**
   - This helper method takes the `filePath` as input.
   - It uses a `try-with-resources` block to ensure that the `BufferedReader` and `FileReader` are closed automatically, even if exceptions occur.
   - It reads the file line by line using `reader.readLine()`.
   - Each line is added to the `ArrayList<String>` called `lines`.
   - The method returns the `List` of lines.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - The `try-catch` block in `main` handles potential `IOExceptions` that might occur during file reading (e.g., file not found). It prints an error message if an exception occurs.

4. **List to Array Conversion:**
   - The `lines.toArray(new String[0])` part efficiently converts the `List<String>` to a `String[]`. The `new String[0]` creates an empty array of the correct type, which `toArray` then uses to create the properly sized array containing the list elements.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FileToArray.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:
