**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles `null` and empty arrays, returning 0 in these cases.

2. **In-Place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` function modifies the input array `nums` directly. The unique elements are placed at the beginning of the array.  

3. **Clearer Variable Naming:** Using `uniqueCount` instead of just `i` or `k` improves readability.

4. **Concise Logic:** The core logic of comparing `nums[i]` with `nums[i-1]` is straightforward and efficient.

5. **Informative Output in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the function and prints both the updated length and the modified portion of the array using `Arrays.copyOfRange`. This makes it easier to verify the results.  This also shows handling of edge cases (empty and null arrays).



This revised code addresses potential issues and provides a better demonstration of how to use the `removeDuplicates` function effectively.
