```java
public class FirstUniqueChar {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "wresource";
        int index = first_Uniq_Char(str);
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("First unique character of the above: " + index);

        str = "aabbccddeeffg"; // Example with a unique character later in the string
        index = first_Uniq_Char(str);
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("First unique character of the above: " + index);


        str = "loveleetcode"; // Example with repeating unique characters
        index = first_Uniq_Char(str);
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("First unique character of the above: " + index);

    }

    public static int first_Uniq_Char(String s) {
        int[] charCount = new int[26]; // Assuming only lowercase English alphabet characters

        // Count the occurrences of each character
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            charCount[c - 'a']++;
        }

        // Find the first character with a count of 1
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (charCount[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] == 1) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return -1; // Should not reach here as we assume at least one unique character exists
    }
}
```


Output:

```
Original String: wresource
First unique character of the above: 0
Original String: aabbccddeeffg
First unique character of the above: 12
Original String: loveleetcode
First unique character of the above: 2
```


Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles all lowercase English alphabet characters:**  Uses an array of size 26 to store character counts.
* **Clearer variable names:**  `charCount` is more descriptive than `freq`.
* **Returns -1 if no unique character is found:** Though the prompt specifies there will always be a unique character,  it's good practice to handle edge cases, even if they are not expected.
* **Added more test cases in `main`:** Demonstrates the function's behavior with different string inputs, including cases where the unique character appears later in the string or when there are multiple unique characters (it correctly finds the *first* unique one).
* **Efficiency:**  The code is efficient, performing the task in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the string. It makes a single pass to count character frequencies and another single pass to find the first unique character.
