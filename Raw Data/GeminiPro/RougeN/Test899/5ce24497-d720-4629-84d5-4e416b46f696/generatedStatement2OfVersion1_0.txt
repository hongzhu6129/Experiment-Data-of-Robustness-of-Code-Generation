Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles all lowercase English alphabet characters:** Uses an array of size 26 to store character counts efficiently.
2. **Clearer variable names:**  Uses `charCounts` instead of `freq` for better readability.
3. **Returns -1 for edge cases (though not strictly required by the problem):**  While the prompt states there will always be a unique character, including a return -1 makes the function more robust for potential variations of the problem (and common practice when searching).
4. **Added more test cases in `main`:** Shows the function working on different inputs, including one where the unique character appears later in the string and the LeetCode example "loveleetcode".
5. **Efficient two-pass approach:** The code first counts character frequencies and then finds the first unique character in a separate loop.  This is more efficient than nested loops.
6. **Comments:**  Explains the purpose of different code sections.
7. **Uses `toCharArray()`:** Converts the string to a character array for easier iteration.


This improved version addresses the original problem's requirements while providing a more robust, efficient, and readable solution.
