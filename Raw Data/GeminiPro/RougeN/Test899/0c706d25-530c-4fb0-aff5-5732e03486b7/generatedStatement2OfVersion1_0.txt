Key improvements:

* **Handles Case where Assumption Doesn't Hold:**  Even though the problem states there's always a unique character, good defensive programming suggests we should still consider the scenario where there isn't one.  The code now returns -1 if no unique character is found.  This makes it more robust.
* **Clearer Comments:**  The comments have been improved to explain the code's logic more effectively.
* **Efficiency:** Using an array for character counts (instead of a `HashMap` or other more complex data structure) is very efficient for the given constraints (lowercase English alphabet characters only).
* **Correctness:** The code has been thoroughly tested and corrected to ensure it returns the correct index of the first unique character.
* **Example Usages in `main`:**  Included different example strings in `main` to demonstrate how the function behaves in various cases.  This helps in understanding and verifying the solution.
