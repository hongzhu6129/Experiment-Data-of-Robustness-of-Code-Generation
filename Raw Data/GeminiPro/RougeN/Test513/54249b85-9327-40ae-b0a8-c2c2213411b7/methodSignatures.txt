 Only use the method signatures public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program to display the first 10 lucus numbers. The Lucas numbers or series are an integer sequence named after the mathematician François Édouard Anatole Lucas, who studied both that sequence and the closely related Fibonacci numbers. Lucas numbers and Fibonacci numbers form complementary instances of Lucas sequences. The sequence of Lucas numbers is: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, …. :\nFirst ten Lucas a numbers:                                              \n2                                                                       \n1                                                                       \n3                                                                       \n4                                                                       \n7                                                                       \n11                                                                      \n18                                                                      \n29                                                                      \n47                                                                      \n76\n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n
