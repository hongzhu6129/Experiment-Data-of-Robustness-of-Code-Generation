**Explanation of the Different Swap Methods:**

1. **Using a Temporary Variable:**  This is the most straightforward method.  A third variable (`temp`) temporarily stores the value of `a`, allowing `a` to be overwritten with `b` and then `b` to be overwritten with the original value of `a` (stored in `temp`).

2. **Using Addition and Subtraction:** This method avoids a temporary variable. The logic is:
   - `a = a + b;` (The sum of the original `a` and `b` is stored in `a`)
   - `b = a - b;` (Subtracting the original `b` from the new `a` leaves the original `a` in `b`)
   - `a = a - b;` (Subtracting the new `b` (original `a`) from the new `a` leaves the original `b` in `a`)
   **Important Note:** This method can have overflow issues if the sum of `a` and `b` exceeds the maximum or minimum integer values.

3. **Using Bitwise XOR (^)**:  This is an efficient and elegant method.  The XOR operation has the property that `a ^ b ^ b = a` and `a ^ b ^ a = b`.  This eliminates the need for a temporary variable and avoids overflow problems.


**Key Improvements in this Code:**

* **Multiple Test Cases:** Demonstrates swapping with different types of values (positive, negative, zero, identical values) and includes a corner case to highlight the potential overflow issue with the addition/subtraction method.
* **Clearer Output:** The output now explicitly states "Before swap" and "After swap" for each test case, making it easier to understand the results.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain each swap method and the purpose of the test cases.
* **Use of XOR for Overflow Safety:**  Uses the XOR method in the corner case (Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE) to prevent overflow, as this is the safest approach in such scenarios.
