Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays.  It returns 0 in both cases, preventing potential `NullPointerExceptions`.

2. **Clearer Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` more clearly represents the purpose of the variable (tracking the index of the last unique element).

3. **Optimized Logic:** The loop starts from index 1, as the first element is always considered unique.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method demonstrates the function's behavior with various inputs, including duplicates, empty arrays, and null arrays.  It also prints the updated array (up to the new length) for better visualization.

5. **Conciseness:** The code is streamlined without sacrificing clarity.

6. **`Arrays.copyOfRange()`:** In the `main` method, `Arrays.copyOfRange()` is used to print only the relevant part of the modified array (up to the new length). This avoids printing the remaining elements which were not part of the "removal" process.



This revised version is more robust, efficient, and provides better clarity and testability.
