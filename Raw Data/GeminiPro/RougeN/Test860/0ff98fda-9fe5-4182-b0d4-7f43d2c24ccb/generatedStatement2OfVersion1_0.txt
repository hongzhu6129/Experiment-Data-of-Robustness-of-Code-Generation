This code directly prints the desired pattern to the console using `System.out.println()`.  The spacing is adjusted to match the example provided in the prompt. Note that the prompt's example output seems to have some extra, seemingly random characters ("fhsaa"). I've assumed this is a typo and omitted them to produce the more logical "J A V A" pattern.  If those characters *are* intended, please clarify, and I'll update the code.
