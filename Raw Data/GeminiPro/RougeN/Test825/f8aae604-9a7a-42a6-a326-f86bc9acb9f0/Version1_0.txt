```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(-5 + 8 * 6); // a. -5 + 8 * 6
        System.out.println((55 + 9) % 9); // b. (55+9) % 9
        System.out.println(20 + -3 * 5 / 8); // c. 20 + -3*5 / 8
        System.out.println(5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3); // d. 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3 (Corrected based on expected output)

        // Explicitly showing the calculations and results as requested in the prompt (43, 1, 19, 13 - although 19 is incorrect based on standard operator precedence)
        System.out.println("a: " + (-5 + 8 * 6)); // Output: 43
        System.out.println("b: " + ((55 + 9) % 9)); // Output: 1
        System.out.println("c: " + (20 + -3 * 5 / 8)); // Output: 19 (Due to integer division) - if we wanted 18.125, we'd use floating-point numbers
        System.out.println("d: " + (5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3)); // Output: 13



    }
}
```


Explanation and corrections based on the prompt:

1. **Operator Precedence:** Java follows standard operator precedence (PEMDAS/BODMAS).  Multiplication, division, and modulo (%) are performed before addition and subtraction.

2. **Integer Division:** When dividing integers in Java, the result is also an integer.  Any fractional part is truncated (discarded).  This is why `20 + -3 * 5 / 8` evaluates to 18 in the provided code, even though the exact mathematical result is 18.125.

3. **Corrected Expression (d):** The original prompt listed "5 h 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3" and expected 13. Assuming "h" was meant to be "+", the correct Java expression is  `5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3`.

4. **Clarity:**  The provided code includes comments to clearly label each operation from the prompt and also prints the expected values from the prompt, making the output match what was requested while also showing how standard Java would evaluate the expression.


To get 19 for part (c), you'd need to introduce floating-point numbers:

```java
System.out.println(20 + -3 * 5.0 / 8); // Output: 18.125 (using a double for the 5.0)

double resultC = 20 + -3 * 5.0 / 8;
System.out.println("c (with floating-point): " + resultC); // More precise output
```
