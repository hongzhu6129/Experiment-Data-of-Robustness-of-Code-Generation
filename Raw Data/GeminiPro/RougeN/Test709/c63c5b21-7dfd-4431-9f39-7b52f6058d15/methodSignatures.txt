 Only use the method signatures public void sort(int[]), private void quickSort(int, int), private void exchangeNumbers(int, int), public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the problem description: write a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the quick thing algorithm. quick sort is a comparison sort, meaning it can sort items of any type for which a less-than relation (formally, a total order) is defined.
The programming language is Java.
