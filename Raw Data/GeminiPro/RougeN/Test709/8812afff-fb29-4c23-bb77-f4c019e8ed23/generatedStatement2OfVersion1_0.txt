Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Pivot Selection:**  The pivot is now calculated as the middle element using `array[lowerIndex+(higherIndex-lowerIndex)/2]`. This is generally safer than using `(lowerIndex + higherIndex)/2` to prevent potential integer overflow issues with very large arrays.
* **Correct Recursive Calls:** The recursive calls to `quickSort` are now correctly placed *after* the partitioning step.  This ensures that the sub-arrays are correctly defined before being recursively sorted.
* **Handles Empty/Null Input:** The `sort` method now correctly handles empty or null input arrays.
* **In-place Sorting:**  The array is sorted in-place (modifying the original array), as is typical for quicksort.
* **Improved Readability:** Variable names and comments have been improved for better understanding.
* **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `QuickSort` class.


This revised code implements a much more robust and correct version of the quicksort algorithm.  It addresses the potential issues and inefficiencies of the original code and provides a good starting point for further optimization if needed.
