Key improvements:

* **Clarity and Comments:**  Added comments to explain each step and the purpose of using a `TreeMap` and `NavigableSet`.
* **Readable Date/Time Output:** Shows how to convert `Instant` to `LocalDateTime` or `ZonedDateTime` for easier interpretation.  `Instant` by itself represents a point in time in UTC, which might not be very user-friendly.
* **Example `NavigableSet` operations:** Includes demonstrations of how to use methods like `first()`, `last()`, `lower()`, and `higher()` to access elements in the `NavigableSet`.
* **Error Handling:** Includes null checks for `lower()` and `higher()` as they can return null if the specified element is the lowest/highest element or not present.
* **`TreeMap` is ideal:** Uses `TreeMap` which provides an ordered set of keys, making it perfectly suited for a timeline representation.  `NavigableSet`  provides efficient methods for navigating the sorted keys.
