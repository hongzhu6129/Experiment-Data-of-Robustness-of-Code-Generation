**Java Code:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MagazineChangeFormat {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read the input magazine text
        String magazineText = scanner.nextLine();

        // Split the magazine text into words
        String[] words = magazineText.split(" ");

        // Reverse the order of the words
        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            System.out.print(words[i] + " ");
        }

        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

**Input:**

```text
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
```

**Expected Output:**

```text
dog lazy the over jumps fox brown quick The
```

**Test Case 2:**

**Input:**

```text
This is a test case.
```

**Expected Output:**

```text
case test a is This
```

**Test Case 3:**

**Input:**

```text
This is a long sentence with many words.
```

**Expected Output:**

```text
words many with sentence long a is This
```

**Test Case 4:**

**Input:**

```text
(empty string)
```

**Expected Output:**

```text
(empty string)
```

**Test Case 5:**

**Input:**

```text
This sentence contains only one word.
```

**Expected Output:**

```text
word one only contains sentence This
```

**Corner Cases:**

* **Empty input:** The program should handle the case of an empty input string by printing an empty string.
* **Single word input:** The program should reverse the order of a single word input.
* **Input with leading/trailing whitespace:** The program should ignore leading and trailing whitespace in the input string.
