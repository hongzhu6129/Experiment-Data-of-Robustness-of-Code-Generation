Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle `ParseException` if the input date string is not in the expected format.  This makes the code more robust.
* **Clearer Output:**  Improved output messages to clearly indicate which conversion is being demonstrated.
* **Multiple Formats Demonstrated:** Shows how to handle different input date formats (yyyy-MM-dd and dd/MM/yyyy) and how to format the output date in various ways using different `SimpleDateFormat` patterns.
* **Comments:** Added comments explaining the code for better readability.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StringToDateConverter.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run: `javac StringToDateConverter.java`
3. **Run:**  `java StringToDateConverter`


The output will show the date conversions in different formats. If you provide an invalid date string, the error message will be displayed.
