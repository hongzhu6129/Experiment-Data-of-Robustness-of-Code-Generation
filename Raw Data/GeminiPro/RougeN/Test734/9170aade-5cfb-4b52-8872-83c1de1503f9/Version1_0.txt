        int[][] arr = {
                {1, 4, 7, 11, 15},
                {2, 5, 8, 12, 19},
                {3, 6, 9, 16, 22},
                {10, 13, 14, 17, 24},

        int[] result = Saddleback(arr, m, n, target);

        if (result[0] != -1) {
            System.out.println("Target " + target + " found at row: " + result[0] + ", column: " + result[1]);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Target " + target + " not found in the array.");
        }

    private static int[] Saddleback(int[][] arr, int m, int n, int target) {
        int row = 0;
        int col = n - 1;

        while (row < m && col >= 0) {
            if (arr[row][col] == target) {
                return new int[]{row, col}; // Target found
            } else if (arr[row][col] < target) {
                row++; // Move down to the next row
            } else {
                col--; // Move left to the previous column

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `m` and `n` for dimensions is fine, but naming the array `arr` instead of `matrix` is more common in Java and slightly more descriptive.

2. **Return an int[]:** The `Saddleback` method now returns an `int[]` of size 2. This is a better practice than relying on global variables.  If the target is found, the array contains the row and column indices. If not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.

3. **Error Handling:** The `main` method now checks the return value from `Saddleback` to print a "not found" message if appropriate.

4. **Saddleback Search Logic:** The core logic of the `Saddleback` search remains efficient. It starts from the top-right corner and moves either down or left, eliminating a row or column with each comparison.  This takes advantage of the sorted nature of the matrix.

5. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function with a sample 2D array and target value.


**How Saddleback Search Works (in detail):**

The key idea is to start at the top-right corner.

* **If the current element is equal to the target:** You've found the target! Return its coordinates.
* **If the current element is smaller than the target:** The target cannot be in the current row (because the row is sorted in ascending order). Move down to the next row.
* **If the current element is larger than the target:**  The target cannot be in the current column (because the column is sorted in ascending order). Move left to the previous column.

This process continues until either the target is found or you've exhausted the search space (i.e., you go out of bounds). Because you eliminate a row or column with each step, the search is efficient.
