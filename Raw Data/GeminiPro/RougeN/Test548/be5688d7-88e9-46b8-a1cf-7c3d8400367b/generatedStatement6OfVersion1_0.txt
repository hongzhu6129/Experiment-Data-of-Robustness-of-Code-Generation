   Replace `/path/to/your/file.txt` with the actual path to the file you want to read.



**Explanation:**

1. **Import necessary classes:** `BufferedReader`, `FileReader`, and `IOException`.
2. **Get file path:**  The code now checks for command-line arguments to get the file path.  This is a more robust approach. If no argument is provided, an error message is printed, and the program exits.
3. **StringBuilder:** Uses a `StringBuilder` for efficient concatenation of lines, as repeatedly concatenating strings directly is inefficient.
4. **Try-with-resources:**  The `BufferedReader` is used inside a try-with-resources block to ensure that the file is closed automatically even if exceptions occur.
5. **Read line by line:** The `readLine()` method reads the file line by line until it returns `null` (end of file).
6. **Append to StringBuilder:** Each line is appended to the `StringBuilder` along with the system's line separator (`System.lineSeparator()`) to preserve the original line breaks.
7. **Store in String:** After reading all lines, the `toString()` method converts the `StringBuilder`'s content to a single `String`.
8. **Error Handling:** The `catch` block handles potential `IOExceptions` that might occur during file reading.
9. **Output:** The `fileData` string now holds the complete contents of the file. The program prints it to the console (you can remove this line if you don't want to print the output).


This improved version addresses the efficiency and error-handling aspects, making it a more robust solution for reading files in Java.  The command-line argument handling also makes it easier to use with different files without modifying the code.
