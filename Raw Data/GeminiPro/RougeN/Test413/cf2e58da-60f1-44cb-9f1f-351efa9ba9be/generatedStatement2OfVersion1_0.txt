Key improvements:

- **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles null, empty, and short strings (length 1 or 2).  These often cause issues if not addressed.
- **Clearer Logic:** Improved code structure and variable names for readability. The logic related to the last occurance has been simplified.
- **Efficient String Building:** Uses `StringBuilder` for efficient string manipulation when removing characters, especially in loops.  Concatenating strings with `+` repeatedly can be slow.
- **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method now has more test cases, including edge cases and various scenarios, to thoroughly demonstrate and validate the code.
- **Flexibility:** You can easily change `charToRemove` to remove a different character.
