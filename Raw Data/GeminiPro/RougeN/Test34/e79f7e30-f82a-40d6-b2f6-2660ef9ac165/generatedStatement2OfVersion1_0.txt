Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Output:** The output now shows the aliases for each character set in a more readable format.
* **Test Cases:** Detailed test cases covering various scenarios, including positive tests, platform compatibility checks, and a challenging corner case (empty charset map), along with explanations of expected results.
* **JUnit Example (Conceptual):** Provides a very basic example of how JUnit and potentially Mockito (or, more realistically, PowerMock) could be used for more rigorous testing. The example demonstrates the general idea but does not implement the complex mocking required for `Charset.availableCharsets()`.  Mocking static methods is challenging and often requires advanced mocking frameworks.


This improved version provides a more robust solution with better testing considerations.  For real-world testing, using a mocking framework like PowerMock would be essential to fully test the edge cases.
