This improved example demonstrates several aspects of "tracking" a key:

1. **Checking Existence:** `containsKey()` verifies if the key is present.
2. **Retrieving Value:** `get()` obtains the value associated with the key.
3. **Updating Value:**  Shows how to modify the value linked to the key.
4. **Removing the Key:**  Demonstrates removing the key and confirming its removal.
5. **`floorKey()` and `ceilingKey()`:** Shows how to find keys relative to the target key.
6. **Printing the TreeMap:** Displays the final state of the TreeMap after operations.



This provides a more complete picture of how you might track and manipulate a key within a `TreeMap`.
