Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Comments:**  Added comments explaining the purpose of each section.
* **Reverse Sorting Example:** Demonstrates how to create a `Comparator` for reverse sorting based on string length.
* **Conciseness:** Removed unnecessary code.
* **Adherence to Prompt:**  Strictly uses only `main` and `compare` methods as requested.  The Comparators are implemented as nested static classes to keep everything within the required methods.


This code fulfills the prompt's requirements while providing a more complete and understandable example of sorting a `TreeMap` using a `Comparator`.
