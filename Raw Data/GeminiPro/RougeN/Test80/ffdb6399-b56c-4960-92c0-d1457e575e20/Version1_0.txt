```java
public class ExecutionTime {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Record the start time in nanoseconds
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();

        // Code to be measured
        // Example: Calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 1000000
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum); // Print the result (optional)


        // Record the end time in nanoseconds
        long endTime = System.nanoTime();

        // Calculate the execution time in nanoseconds
        long executionTime = endTime - startTime;

        // Print the execution time
        System.out.println("Execution time: " + executionTime + " nanoseconds");


        //Another slightly more accurate way is to use System.currentTimeMillis to measure execution time in milliseconds
        //This is generally preferred over nanoTime for benchmarking as it's less susceptible to issues
        long startMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();
        //The code you want to measure the execution time of goes here:
         sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        long endMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long timeTakenMillis = endMillis - startMillis;

        System.out.println("Time taken in milliseconds: " + timeTakenMillis);



    }
}
```


Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer comments:**  The comments explain each step of the process.
* **More realistic example:** The example code now does a simple calculation (summing numbers), making it more representative of a real-world scenario.  A simple empty loop isn't very useful for benchmarking.
* **Millisecond timing example:**  Provides a more practical millisecond-based timer example using `System.currentTimeMillis()`.  This is often more useful for longer running benchmarks.
* **Explanation of millisecond preference:** Explains *why* `currentTimeMillis()` can be a better choice for general benchmarking.



Important Note on `nanoTime()`

While `nanoTime()` provides nanosecond resolution, it's primarily intended for measuring *relative* time differences within a single JVM run, not absolute wall-clock time. Its accuracy and behavior can vary between operating systems and JVM implementations.  For longer-running benchmarks, `currentTimeMillis()` is often more reliable and consistent.
