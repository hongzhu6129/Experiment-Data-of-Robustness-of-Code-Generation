Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  It now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays.
* **Clearer output:**  The output now explicitly states the length of the array after removing duplicates and prints the modified array (up to the new length).
* **More comprehensive testing:**  The `main` method includes more test cases, including an empty array and a null array, to demonstrate robustness.
* **Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`:** Prevents printing elements beyond the new length after duplicate removal, avoiding confusion.
* **More efficient in-place modification:** The algorithm directly modifies the input array `nums` to store the unique elements at the beginning. This avoids creating a new array, which is more memory-efficient.



The `removeDuplicates` function now efficiently modifies the array in place and returns the correct count of unique elements even in boundary cases.  The main method provides clearer demonstrations of how the function works.
