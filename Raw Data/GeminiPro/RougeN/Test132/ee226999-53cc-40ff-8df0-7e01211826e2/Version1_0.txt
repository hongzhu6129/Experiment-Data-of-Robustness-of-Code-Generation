        double piApproximation1 = 4 * (1.0 - (1.0 / 3) + (1.0 / 5) - (1.0 / 7) + (1.0 / 9) - (1.0 / 11));
        double piApproximation2 = 4 * (1.0 - (1.0 / 3) + (1.0 / 5) - (1.0 / 7) + (1.0 / 9) - (1.0 / 11) + (1.0 / 13));

        System.out.println("Approximation 1 of Pi: " + piApproximation1);
        System.out.println("Approximation 2 of Pi: " + piApproximation2);


        // More educational version, demonstrating the series expansion and how
        // adding more terms improves accuracy:

        double sum = 1.0;
        double sign = -1.0; // Start with subtraction for the 1/3 term
        double denominator = 3.0;

        System.out.println("Demonstrating the series expansion:");
        for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++){  // Calculate for 6 terms (up to 1/13)
            sum += sign * (1.0 / denominator);
            System.out.println("Approximation with " + (i+2) +" term(s) :"+ 4*sum); // Display intermediate results
            sign *= -1.0;  // Flip sign for next term
            denominator += 2.0; // Increment denominator by 2 for the next odd number
         
        }




    }
}
```


Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Use of 1.0:** The prompt specifically requests to use `1.0` instead of `1` to ensure floating-point division is performed.  This is crucial for accuracy when calculating the approximations.

2. **Clear Output:** The code now prints the results of both approximations with descriptive labels, making the output easier to understand.

3. **Educational Enhancement:**  The added loop and print statements within the loop demonstrate how the value approaches pi as more terms are added to the series.  This provides a better understanding of the underlying mathematical concept.

4. **Correct Series Formula:** The original question had a typo in the formula (a "+" where there should have been a "-").  The corrected code uses the alternating signs:  1 - (1/3) + (1/5) - (1/7) + ...  

5. **Comments:**  Comments have been added to further explain what the code is doing, making it more educational.
