**Explanation and Corrections:**

1. **Formula Correction:** The provided formula `p = 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) + (1/9) - (1/11).. )` had incorrect signs. The Leibniz formula for pi uses alternating signs: `4 * (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ...)`

2. **Using Doubles:**  We use `1.0`, `3.0`, etc., instead of `1`, `3`, etc., to ensure floating-point division.  Integer division would truncate the results and lead to an inaccurate approximation.

3. **Clarity and Output:**  The code now clearly labels the two approximations for better understanding.



**How the Leibniz Formula Works:**

The Leibniz formula is an infinite series.  The more terms you include (i.e., the larger the denominator in the last fraction), the closer the approximation gets to the true value of pi.  The code demonstrates this by calculating the approximation with two different numbers of terms.  You'll see that the second approximation (including 1/13) is slightly closer to pi.
