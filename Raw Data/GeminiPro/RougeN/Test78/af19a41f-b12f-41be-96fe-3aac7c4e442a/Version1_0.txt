Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly indicates whether a security manager exists and handles cases where environment variables might not be defined.  This is more user-friendly.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility for TEMP:** The code now checks for both `TEMP` and `TMP` environment variables, as different operating systems might use different names for the temporary directory.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility for USERNAME:** Similar to TEMP, the code now also checks for both `USERNAME` (Windows) and `USER` (Unix-like systems, e.g. Linux, macOS) environment variables to ensure it works across different platforms.
* **Error Handling:** The code includes error handling to gracefully handle situations where an environment variable isn't defined, preventing `NullPointerExceptions`.


This revised code addresses the original prompt's requirements more robustly and provides a better user experience.
