Key improvements in this version:

1. **Handles null and empty input:** The code now gracefully handles cases where the input string is `null` or empty. It prints an empty line in these situations.

2. **Uses `split("\\s+")`:** This improvement uses a regular expression `\\s+` to split the string by one or more whitespace characters. This ensures correct handling of multiple spaces between words.

3. **More Efficient String Reversal (within each word):** Using `StringBuilder.reverse()` is a more performant way to reverse a string compared to character-by-character manipulation.

4. **Trimmed Output:**  The `trim()` method is used to remove leading/trailing whitespace from the final reversed string, which results in cleaner output.

5. **Clearer comments:** The comments better explain the purpose of each code section.

6. **Example usage in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `reverseEachWordInString` method with different inputs, including null and empty strings.
