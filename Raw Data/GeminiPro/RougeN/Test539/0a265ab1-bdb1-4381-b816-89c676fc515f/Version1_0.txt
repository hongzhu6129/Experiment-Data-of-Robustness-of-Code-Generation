            System.out.println("  Readable: Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("  Readable: No");
        }

        if (file.canWrite()) {
            System.out.println("  Writable: Yes");

To compile and run this:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FilePermissions.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac FilePermissions.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled class, providing the path to the file or directory you want to check as a command-line argument:  `java FilePermissions /path/to/your/file.txt`  or `java FilePermissions /path/to/your/directory`

   Replace `/path/to/your/file.txt` or `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual path.  For example, on Windows, it might be something like `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\myfile.txt`.  On macOS or Linux, it might be `/home/yourname/documents/myfile.txt`.


**Explanation:**

* The code first checks if a file path is provided as a command-line argument.  If not, it prints usage instructions and exits.
* It creates a `File` object representing the specified path.
* It verifies that the file or directory exists.
* It determines whether the path represents a file or a directory.
* It uses `file.canRead()` and `file.canWrite()` to check read and write permissions, respectively, and prints the results to the console.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code includes basic error handling for the case where the file/directory doesn't exist or no path is provided. More robust error handling (e.g., catching `SecurityException` in case permission checks are restricted) could be added.
* **Operating System Differences:** File permissions behave differently on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).  This code uses standard Java methods that work across platforms, but the underlying permission model might have nuances.
* **Security Context:** The permissions checked are relative to the user running the Java program.  If the user doesn't have the necessary permissions, the checks will reflect that, even if the file/directory might have different permissions for other users.
