        root.left.left = new Node(4);
        root.left.right = new Node(5);
        root.left.right.left = new Node(6); // Added a deeper node to test

Explanation:

1. **Node Class:** Represents a node in the binary tree, holding data and pointers to left and right children.
2. **maxDepth(Node node):**
   - This recursive method calculates the maximum depth of the tree.
   - **Base Case:** If the node is null (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  It recursively calculates the depth of the left and right subtrees. Then, it returns the maximum of these two depths, plus 1 (for the current node).
3. **main(String[] args):**
   - Creates a sample binary tree.  It's important to create different tree structures to thoroughly test your code.
   - Calls `maxDepth()` to calculate and print the height (which is the same as maximum depth) of the tree.


Key improvements and points to note:

* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is now well-commented and formatted for better understanding.
* **Efficiency:** The recursive approach is the most natural and efficient way to calculate tree depth.
* **Correctness:** Handles the base case (empty tree) correctly and ensures the maximum depth is calculated accurately.
* **Testability:** The `main` method provides a sample tree for testing.  Add more complex test cases to be thorough.  Consider adding unit tests if you're working on a larger project.
