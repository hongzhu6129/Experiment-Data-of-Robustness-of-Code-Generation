Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles null and empty strings:**  The `endWithmOrn` method now correctly handles `null` and empty input strings, returning 0 in those cases to prevent `NullPointerException` or other unexpected behavior.
* **Uses `\\b` for word boundaries:** The regular expression now includes `\\b` (word boundary anchors) to ensure that it only matches whole words. This prevents it from matching substrings like "hamstring" or "running".
* **Case-insensitive matching:** The regex uses the character class `[mnMN]` to match 'm' or 'n' in any case (upper or lower).
* **Clearer variable names:** Using `pattern` and `matcher` makes the code more readable.
* **More comprehensive testing:** The `main` method includes more test cases to demonstrate the handling of different input scenarios (including `null`, empty, and whitespace-only strings).


This revised code is more robust, accurate, and easier to understand.
