Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles cases where the input string is null or empty, `n` is invalid (<= 0 or > string length). This makes the function more robust.

2. **Handles Uneven Division:** The `remainder` variable and the logic within the loop ensure that if the string length is not perfectly divisible by `n`, the extra characters are distributed as evenly as possible among the parts.

3. **Clearer Output:**  A newline is printed after each example in the `main` method to make the output easier to read.

4. **More Comprehensive Testing:**  The `main` method now includes tests with edge cases (empty string, invalid `n`, null string) to demonstrate the improved error handling.

5. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic of the code.
