Key improvements:

- **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays and null inputs.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` makes the code easier to understand.
- **Concise return:** Returns the new length directly.
- **Thorough `main` method:**  Includes more test cases to demonstrate handling of different scenarios (empty array, null input, all unique elements).
- **Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`:**  Prints only the relevant portion of the modified array after removing duplicates in the `main` method. This avoids printing any leftover elements from the original array that are no longer part of the new, shorter array.



This revised solution is robust, efficient, and adheres to the specified method signatures.  It also provides clear output to demonstrate its correctness.
