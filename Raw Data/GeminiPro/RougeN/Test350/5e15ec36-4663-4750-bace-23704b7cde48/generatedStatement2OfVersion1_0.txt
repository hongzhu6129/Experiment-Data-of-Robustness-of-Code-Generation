Key improvements in this version:

- **Uses a `Set`:**  The `interleavings` is now a `HashSet` to automatically handle duplicate interleavings, which can occur if the input strings have repeating characters.
- **Clearer Base Case:** The base case in `allInterleavings` is more concise and easier to understand.
- **More Robust:** Handles different lengths of input strings correctly.
- **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `allInterleavings` method with a couple of different examples, including one where one string is shorter than the other.  It also resets the `interleavings` set between examples for clarity.
- **Informative Output:** The `main` method now prints the input strings so the output is self-explanatory.
