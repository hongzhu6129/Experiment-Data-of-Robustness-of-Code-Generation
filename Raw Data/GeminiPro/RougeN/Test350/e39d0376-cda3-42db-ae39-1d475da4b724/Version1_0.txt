            System.out.println(interleaving);
        }


        // Example with "flute" as requested in prompt (interleaving with ""):
        str1 = "flute";
        str2 = "";
        interleavings.clear(); // Clear the set for the next example
        allInterleavings(str1, str2, "", interleavings);

        System.out.println("\nInterleavings of '" + str1 + "' and '" + str2 + "':");

Key improvements in this version:

* **Uses a Set:**  A `HashSet` is used to store the interleavings.  This automatically handles duplicates, which is essential for correctness.  
* **Clearer Base Case:** The base case in the recursion (when both strings are empty) is now more concise and readable.
* **Example with "flute":** The code includes an example specifically using "flute" as one of the input strings and an empty string "" as the other, as requested in the prompt, demonstrating that it can handle such a case.
* **Comments and Formatting:** The code is well-commented and formatted for readability.
* **Efficiency:** By using a `Set`, we avoid storing duplicate interleavings, which can significantly improve performance, especially for longer input strings.


This revised code provides a correct, efficient, and well-structured solution to generate all unique interleavings of two given strings.
