Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** `k` is now used consistently to represent the new array's length, making the code easier to follow.

2. **In-Place Modification:**  The code directly modifies the input `nums` array. This is a common and efficient practice for this type of problem. Elements not equal to `val` are moved to the front of the array.

3. **Correct Return Value:**  The function returns the correct length (`k`) of the modified array (containing elements not equal to `val`).

4. **Improved Output:** The `main` method now prints both the original array and the updated array (up to its new length), providing a more complete demonstration of the function's behavior.
