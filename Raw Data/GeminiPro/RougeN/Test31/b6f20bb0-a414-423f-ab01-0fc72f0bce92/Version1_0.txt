```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class EarthDistance {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Input the latitude of coordinate 1: ");
        double lat1 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());

        System.out.print("Input the longitude of coordinate 1: ");
        double lon1 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());

        System.out.print("Input the latitude of coordinate 2: ");
        double lat2 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());

        System.out.print("Input the longitude of coordinate 2: ");
        double lon2 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());

        double earthRadius = 6371.01; // in kilometers

        double distance = earthRadius * Math.acos(Math.sin(lat1) * Math.sin(lat2) + Math.cos(lat1) * Math.cos(lat2) * Math.cos(lon1 - lon2));

        System.out.println("The distance between those points is: " + distance);
        input.close();
    }

**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Output: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -74
   - Expected Output: 0 km

3. **Antipodes (opposite sides of the Earth):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 106  (180 degrees opposite longitude)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's diameter)

4. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90 (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0  (Longitude doesn't matter at poles)
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km

5. **Points near the Prime Meridian and 180th Meridian:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0.1 (Near Prime Meridian)
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: -179.9 (Near 180th Meridian)
   - Expected Output:  A small distance (demonstrates handling the meridian transition)


6. **Points on the Equator:**
    - lat1: 0
    - lon1: 20
    - lat2: 0
    - lon2: 50
    - Expected Output: Calculated distance based on longitude difference only.

7. **Invalid Input (e.g., latitude outside -90 to 90 range):**  You should include input validation in a robust program to handle this, but for testing, try inputs like:
    - lat1: 100 (invalid)
    - The program should gracefully handle this error (either throw an exception or print an error message).


**How to Implement Test Cases:**

You could create a separate testing class or use a testing framework like JUnit to automate these tests. The test would call your `EarthDistance` program with the test inputs and assert that the calculated distance is within an acceptable tolerance of the expected output.  Example (using `assert` - you would need to enable assertions at runtime with `-ea` flag):

```java
// ... in your testing code ...

double distance = calculateDistance(25, 35, 35.5, 25.5);  // Call your distance calculation function
assert Math.abs(distance - 1480.0848451069087) < 0.001 : "Test case 1 failed";  // Check within a tolerance

// ... other test cases ...
```


By running these test cases, you can verify the correctness of your program under different conditions.  Adding robust input validation is highly recommended to make your program more user-friendly and prevent unexpected behavior.
