Key improvements:

* **Handles `null` inputs:** The `removeString` method now checks for null arguments and returns the main string if either is null. This prevents `NullPointerExceptions`.
* **Clearer `main` method:** The `main` method now includes multiple test cases to demonstrate the behavior of the `removeString` method in different scenarios, including overlapping occurrences and null input.  It makes it easier to understand how the method works.
* **Uses `String.replace()`:** This is the most concise and efficient way to remove all occurrences of a substring in Java.  It's better than manually looping and manipulating the string.
