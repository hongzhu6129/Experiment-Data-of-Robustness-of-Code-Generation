**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Node Class:** A `Node` class is defined to represent the nodes of the binary tree. Each node holds an integer `data` value and references to its left and right children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):** This recursive method calculates the maximum depth (height) of the binary tree.
   - **Base Case:** If the `node` is `null` (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  It recursively calculates the depth of the left and right subtrees (`lDepth` and `rDepth`). The maximum of these depths + 1 (for the current node) is returned.

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - Creates instances of the `BinaryTreeDepth` class and `Node` objects to build sample binary trees.  I've added a second example tree (`root2`) to demonstrate how it works with different structures.
   - Calls the `maxDepth()` method to calculate and print the height of the created trees.



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `BinaryTreeDepth.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Compile the code using:
