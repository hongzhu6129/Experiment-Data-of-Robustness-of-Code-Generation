**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Node Class:** Represents a node in the binary tree. It has `data`, `left` child, and `right` child.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):** This recursive method calculates the maximum depth (or height) of the tree.
   - **Base Case:** If `node` is `null` (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  It recursively calculates the depth of the left and right subtrees (`lDepth` and `rDepth`).  It then returns the maximum of these depths plus 1 (to account for the current node).

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - Creates a sample binary tree.  You can modify this to create different tree structures for testing.
   - Calls `maxDepth()` to calculate and print the height of the tree.

**Key Improvements over a simpler approach:**

- **Handles `null` nodes:** The base case (`node == null`) correctly handles empty subtrees and prevents `NullPointerExceptions`.
- **Clear and Concise:**  The code is easy to understand and follows standard recursion patterns.
- **Efficient:** This recursive approach efficiently explores the tree without redundant calculations.


**How to use it:**

1. **Compile:** Save the code as `BinaryTreeMaxDepth.java` and compile it using a Java compiler:  `javac BinaryTreeMaxDepth.java`
2. **Run:**  `java BinaryTreeMaxDepth`

The output will be the height/max depth of the sample tree you created in the `main` method. You can modify the tree structure in `main` to test with different trees.
