```java
public class Pattern {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("j    a   v     v  a");
        System.out.println("j   a a   v   v  a a");
        System.out.println("j  aaaaa   V V  aaaaa");
        System.out.println("jj a     a  V  a     a");

        //  Alternatively for a slightly different (but possibly intended) output:
        //System.out.println("j   a   v   v");
        //System.out.println("j  a a   v   v");
        //System.out.println("j aaaaa   V V");
        //System.out.println("jj a     a  V");

        // Or, yet another interpretation (based on the "j a v v..." at the start of the prompt):
        //System.out.println("j   a   v     v");
        //System.out.println("j  a a   v   v");
        //System.out.println("j aaaaa   V V");
        //System.out.println("jj a     a  V");
    }
}
```


There were a few ambiguities in the requested pattern, so I've provided three options.  The first matches the example most closely if you consider spaces as part of the pattern.  The second and third are alternatives if the leading "j a v v" was meant to be descriptive and the pattern is more symmetrical.  Choose the one that best fits the intended output.
