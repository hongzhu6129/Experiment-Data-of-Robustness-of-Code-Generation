```java
public class ApproximatePi {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double piApproximation1 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0/3.0) + (1.0/5.0) - (1.0/7.0) + (1.0/9.0) - (1.0/11.0));
        double piApproximation2 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0/3.0) + (1.0/5.0) - (1.0/7.0) + (1.0/9.0) - (1.0/11.0) + (1.0/13.0));

        System.out.println("Approximation 1: " + piApproximation1);
        System.out.println("Approximation 2: " + piApproximation2);
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Corrections:**

The original prompt had a couple of errors in the formula and the specified terms.  The Leibniz formula for pi uses alternating addition and subtraction, and the denominators are consecutive odd numbers.

Here's a breakdown of the corrected code:

1. **Data Type:** We use `double` to store the approximations to handle decimal values accurately.

2. **Formula Implementation:** The code now correctly implements the Leibniz formula up to the 11th and 13th terms, respectively, with alternating signs.

3. **Output:** The `System.out.println()` statements display the calculated approximations.

4. **Explicit `1.0` and `3.0`, etc.:** The prompt requested using `1.0` instead of `1`, so the code explicitly uses floating-point literals for all numbers in the calculation to ensure floating-point division is performed.


This corrected code will provide more accurate approximations of pi based on the given series.  The more terms you include in the series, the closer the approximation gets to the actual value of pi.
