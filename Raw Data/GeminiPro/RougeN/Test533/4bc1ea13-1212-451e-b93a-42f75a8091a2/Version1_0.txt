**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **Hamming Numbers Definition:**  Hamming numbers (or regular numbers) are positive integers whose only prime factors are 2, 3, and 5.

2. **Algorithm:** The efficient algorithm used here maintains three indices (`i2`, `i3`, `i5`) and three corresponding "next" values (`next2`, `next3`, `next5`). These represent the next Hamming number that can be generated by multiplying the current Hamming numbers (indexed by `i2`, `i3`, `i5`) by 2, 3, and 5, respectively.

3. **Initialization:** We initialize the first Hamming number to 1, and the `next` values to 2, 3, and 5.

4. **Iteration:** In each iteration of the loop, we find the smallest of `next2`, `next3`, and `next5`.  This minimum value becomes the next Hamming number.

5. **Updating Next Values:**  Critically, whenever we select a `next` value (e.g., `next2`), we update it by multiplying the *next* Hamming number in the sequence (indexed by `i2` + 1) by 2 (or 3 or 5, accordingly). This ensures that we generate the Hamming numbers in increasing order without duplicates. The reason we use separate `if` statements (not `if-else if`) is that a Hamming number could be divisible by more than one of 2, 3, or 5 (e.g., 6 is divisible by both 2 and 3, so we need to update both `next2` and `next3`).

6. **Output:** The code prints the first 20 Hamming numbers generated.


**How it avoids duplicates:** The crucial step is using separate `if` statements (not `if-else`) when updating the next values. Imagine we were at `next2 = 6`, `next3 = 6`, `next5 = 10`. If we used `if-else`, only `next2` would be updated, and we'd miss the fact that 6 is also generated by multiplying 2 by 3. The separate `if`s ensure both `next2` and `next3` are updated, avoiding duplicates.
