Key improvements and explanations in this refined code:

* **Clearer Examples:**  Demonstrates iteration with both a standard 2D array (like a traditional multiplication table) and a `List` of `List`s (more flexible for dynamic sizing).
* **Comments:**  Explains the purpose of each section.
* **Formatting:**  Uses tabs (`\t`) for aligned output, making the multiplication table structure much more readable.
* **Flexibility:** The example with `List<List<Integer>>` shows how to handle a more dynamic situation where the "multiplication list" might not be a perfectly rectangular 2D array.
* **Best Practices:** Uses enhanced `for` loops (also known as "for-each" loops) where appropriate for cleaner code.  Retains the traditional `for` loop example for demonstration as well.
