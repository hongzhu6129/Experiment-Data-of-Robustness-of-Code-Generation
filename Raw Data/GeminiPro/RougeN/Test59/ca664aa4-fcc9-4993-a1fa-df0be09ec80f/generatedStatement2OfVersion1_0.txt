**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Exception Handling:** The code now includes exception handling to address the case where the input strings have the same length.  This makes the code more robust.  The `IllegalArgumentException` clearly communicates the issue.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `shortString` and `longString` improve readability compared to `str1` and `str2` after the length comparison.

3. **Concise Conditional:** The ternary operator (`condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`) is used to assign `shortString` and `longString` efficiently.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**
   - **Normal Cases:** Test with strings of different lengths.
   - **Corner Cases:**  Test with empty strings, and strings of the same length (to trigger the exception).
   - **Special Characters:** Test with special characters and spaces to ensure they are handled correctly.  It's crucial to test these to avoid unexpected behavior.


**Key improvements over previous versions:**

- **Robustness:** Handles the case of equal length strings gracefully using an exception.
- **Readability:** Uses clearer variable names and more concise logic.
- **Thorough Testing:** Includes more comprehensive test cases to cover edge cases and special characters.  The comments explain what each test case is demonstrating and the expected output. This makes debugging and future maintenance easier.
