Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Problem Interpretation:** The original prompt was a bit ambiguous. This code interprets "exceeds depth part" as finding and printing nodes that are *deeper* than a specified target depth.

2. **Helper Function:**  The `printNodesExceedingDepth` function is introduced to handle the task of finding and printing nodes beyond the target depth.  This makes the code more organized and readable.

3. **Depth Tracking:** The `currentDepth` parameter in the helper function keeps track of the current depth as we traverse the tree recursively.

4. **Example in `main`:** The `main` method now includes an example of how to use the `printNodesExceedingDepth` function to find nodes beyond a specific depth (in the example, depth 2).

5. **Recursive Approach:** The recursive nature of both `maxDepth` and `printNodesExceedingDepth` is efficient for tree traversal.

6. **Concise and Readable Code:** The code is written with clarity and follows best practices for naming and indentation.


This revised version provides a complete and functional solution for finding and printing nodes that exceed a given depth in a binary tree, while adhering to the specified method signatures.
