**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Node Class:**  Defines the structure of a node in the binary tree.  Each node holds an integer `data` and references to its left and right children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):**  This recursive method calculates the maximum depth:
   - **Base Case:** If the `node` is `null` (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  Recursively calculates the depth of the left subtree (`lDepth`) and the right subtree (`rDepth`). The maximum depth of the current node is 1 plus the larger of `lDepth` and `rDepth`.

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - Creates instances of the `BinaryTreeMaxDepth` class and `Node` objects to build a sample binary tree.
   - Calls `maxDepth()` to calculate and print the height/depth of the tree.
   - Includes additional test cases: an empty tree and a single-node tree to demonstrate correctness in edge cases.


**Key Improvement: Clearer Code and Test Cases:** The original response lacked test cases.  This version provides a more complete and testable solution. The `main` method demonstrates how to create and use the `maxDepth()` function and verifies it with different tree structures. This makes the code much more robust and easier to understand.
