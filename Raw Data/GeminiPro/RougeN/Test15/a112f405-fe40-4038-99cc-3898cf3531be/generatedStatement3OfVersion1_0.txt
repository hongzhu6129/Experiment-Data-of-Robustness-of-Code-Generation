**Key Improvements in the provided code:**

* **Handles 0 correctly:** The original code had a flaw where it returned an empty string for the input 0.  This has been fixed.
* **More Efficient String Construction:** Uses prepending (`hex = hexChars[remainder] + hex;`) instead of appending characters, which is significantly more efficient in Java as strings are immutable.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `hexChars` instead of just `hex` for the character array makes the code more readable.
* **Scanner Closure:** The `scanner.close()` is added to release the resource.

This improved version and the comprehensive test cases make for a much more robust and reliable solution.  Remember to consider how you want to handle negative input values, and ensure your tests cover those cases as well.
