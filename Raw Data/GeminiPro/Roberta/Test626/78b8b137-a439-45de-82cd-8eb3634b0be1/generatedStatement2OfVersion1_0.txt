This code demonstrates the `lower()` method's functionality with different scenarios, including:

1. **Finding a lower element:** Shows how to find the element immediately less than a given element.
2. **No lower element:** Demonstrates the case where no smaller element exists (e.g., using the smallest element in the set).
3. **String TreeSet:** Shows how `lower()` works with a TreeSet of Strings, emphasizing that the method relies on the natural ordering of the elements.


The output clearly explains the results of each scenario, making the educational aspect more effective.  The added examples with different data types and edge cases provide a more comprehensive understanding.
