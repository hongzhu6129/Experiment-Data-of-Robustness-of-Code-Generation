```java
public class Staircase {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; // Example number of coins

        buildStaircase(n);
    }

    public static void buildStaircase(int n) {
        int row = 1;
        int coinsUsed = 0;

        while (coinsUsed + row <= n) {
            // Print the current row
            for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
                System.out.print("* ");
            }
            System.out.println(); // New line

            coinsUsed += row;
            row++;
        }

        // Handle remaining coins (if any)
        if (coinsUsed < n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n - coinsUsed; i++) {
                System.out.print("* ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```


Explanation:

1. **`main` method:**
   - Sets an example `n` value (number of coins).
   - Calls `buildStaircase` to construct and print the staircase.

2. **`buildStaircase` method:**
   - Initializes `row` to 1 (starts with a row of 1 coin).
   - Initializes `coinsUsed` to 0 (keeps track of coins placed).
   - Uses a `while` loop: continues as long as adding the next row's coins (`coinsUsed + row`) doesn't exceed the total number of coins (`n`).
   - **Inside the loop:**
     - Prints the current row:  A nested `for` loop prints `* ` (an asterisk and a space) `row` times. Then a `println()` adds a newline.
     - Updates `coinsUsed` by adding the number of coins in the current row (`row`).
     - Increments `row` for the next row.
   - **After the loop:**
     - Handles remaining coins: If `coinsUsed` is less than `n`, there are some coins left. Another `for` loop prints the remaining coins (asterisks).  This is necessary because the last row might be incomplete.


How it meets the requirements:

- **Staircase shape:**  The nested loop and `println()` create the staircase structure.
- **k-th row has k coins:** The outer loop ensures that row 1 has 1 coin, row 2 has 2 coins, row 3 has 3 coins, and so on, as long as there are enough coins.
- **Handles remaining coins:** The code after the `while` loop makes sure that any leftover coins are placed in a final (possibly incomplete) row.


Example Output (n = 10):

```
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
```
