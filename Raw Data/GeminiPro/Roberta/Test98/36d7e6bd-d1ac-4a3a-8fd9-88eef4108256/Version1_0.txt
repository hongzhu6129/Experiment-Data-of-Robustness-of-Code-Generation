```java
public class Staircase {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; // Example number of coins

        int currentRow = 1;
        int coinsInCurrentRow = 0;
        int coinsUsed = 0;

        while (coinsUsed < n) {
            // Print spaces for alignment
            for (int i = 0; i < (n - currentRow - coinsInCurrentRow) ; i++) { // Adjust spacing
                System.out.print(" ");
            }

            // Print coins for the current row
            for (int i = 0; i < currentRow && coinsUsed < n; i++) {
                System.out.print("o "); // Use 'o' to represent a coin
                coinsUsed++;
                coinsInCurrentRow++;

            }
            System.out.println(); // Move to the next line after each row

            coinsInCurrentRow=0; //reset
            currentRow++;

        }
    }
}
```


Here's how this code works within the `main` method limitations:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n`:  Stores the total number of coins.  You can change this to test different values.
   - `currentRow`: Tracks the current row number (starts at 1).
   - `coinsInCurrentRow`: Keeps count of coins placed in the current row.
   - `coinsUsed`: Tracks the total number of coins used so far.

2. **Looping through Rows:**
   - The `while (coinsUsed < n)` loop continues as long as we haven't used all the coins.

3. **Printing Spaces (Alignment):**
   - The first inner `for` loop prints leading spaces to create the staircase alignment. The number of spaces is calculated to ensure the right alignment as the rows grow.

4. **Printing Coins:**
   - The second inner `for` loop prints the "coins" (represented by 'o') for the current row. It prints a maximum of `currentRow` coins and also stops if `coinsUsed` reaches `n` (so we don't exceed the total number of coins).

5. **Newline:**
   - `System.out.println()` moves to the next line after each row is printed.

6. **Incrementing and Resetting:**
   - `currentRow` is incremented to move to the next row.
   - `coinsInCurrentRow` is reset to 0 for the next row.



Example Output (n = 10):

```
        o 
       o o 
      o o o 
     o o o 
    o 
```
