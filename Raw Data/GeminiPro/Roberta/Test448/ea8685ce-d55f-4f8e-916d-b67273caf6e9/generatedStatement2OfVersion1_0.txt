Key improvements in this version:

* **Input Validation:** The code now checks for invalid month input (outside the 1-12 range) and exits gracefully with an error message if an invalid month is entered.  This prevents unexpected behavior.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `input.close()` to release system resources. This is good practice, especially in larger programs.
* **Clearer Output:** The output message is more informative.
* **Standard Formatting:**  Improved indentation and code style for better readability.


This revised code provides a more robust and user-friendly solution for determining the number of days in a month.
