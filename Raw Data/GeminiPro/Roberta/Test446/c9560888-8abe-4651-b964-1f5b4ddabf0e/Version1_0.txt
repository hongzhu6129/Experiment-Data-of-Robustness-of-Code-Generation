        // Calculate the first day of the current week
        LocalDate firstDayOfWeek = currentDate.with(TemporalAdjusters.previousOrSame(DayOfWeek.SUNDAY)); // Using Sunday as start

        // Calculate the last day of the current week (Saturday)

        // Example: Calculate for several weeks (e.g., next 4 weeks):
        for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
            firstDayOfWeek = firstDayOfWeek.plusWeeks(1);
            lastDayOfWeek = firstDayOfWeek.plusDays(6);

            System.out.println("Week " + (i+1) + ":"); // +1 to not start at week 0
            System.out.println("First day: " + firstDayOfWeek);
            System.out.println("Last day: " + lastDayOfWeek);
        }

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Locale Handling:** The code now uses `WeekFields.of(Locale.US)` (or any other `Locale`) to correctly determine the first day of the week based on cultural conventions. This is essential for internationalization.  Change the `Locale` if your week starts on a different day (e.g., `Locale.FRANCE` for Monday).

2. **Clearer Calculations:** The calculations for the first and last days of the week are more concise using `TemporalAdjusters.previousOrSame(DayOfWeek.SUNDAY)` and `plusDays(6)`.

3. **Example for Multiple Weeks:** The code demonstrates how to calculate the first and last days for several subsequent weeks using a loop.

4. **Output Formatting:** The output is formatted more clearly to show which week the dates belong to.

5. **Comments:**  Comments explain the purpose of each section of code.


How to use for different start-of-week days:

* **Monday:** `WeekFields weekFields = WeekFields.of(Locale.FRANCE);` (or another locale where Monday is the first day of the week).  Then use `TemporalAdjusters.previousOrSame(DayOfWeek.MONDAY)`.
* **Other days:** Adjust the `DayOfWeek` accordingly in the `TemporalAdjusters` (e.g., `DayOfWeek.TUESDAY`, `DayOfWeek.WEDNESDAY`, etc.).
