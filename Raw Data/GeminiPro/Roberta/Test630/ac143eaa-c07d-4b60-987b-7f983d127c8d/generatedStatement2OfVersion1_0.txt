Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

* **Clearer Explanations:**  Comments explain each step, including the default behavior of `PriorityQueue` with Strings (natural ordering) and how `poll()` works.
* **Multiple Iteration Methods:** Demonstrates three ways to print the elements: 
    1. `poll()` (removes elements).
    2. Enhanced `for` loop (non-destructive).
    3. `iterator()` (non-destructive). (Commented out, but provided as an option)
* **`peek()` Example:** Shows how to use `peek()` to see the highest priority element without removing it.
* **Custom Comparator Hint:** Includes a commented-out example of how to use a `Comparator` to customize the ordering (e.g., reverse alphabetical order).
* **Re-adding Elements:** The code re-adds the colors after the destructive `poll()` loop so that the non-destructive methods can be demonstrated on a full queue.
* **Concise and Focused:** The code is streamlined and focuses on the core concepts of `PriorityQueue` usage, making it easier to understand for educational purposes.
