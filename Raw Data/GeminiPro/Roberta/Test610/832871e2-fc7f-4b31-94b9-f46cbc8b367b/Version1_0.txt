```java
import java.util.TreeSet;

public class TreeSetLessThanSeven {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Create a TreeSet of Integer objects
        TreeSet<Integer> numbers = new TreeSet<>();

        // Add some numbers to the TreeSet
        numbers.add(2);
        numbers.add(9);
        numbers.add(5);
        numbers.add(1);
        numbers.add(12);
        numbers.add(7); // 7 itself won't be included as we're looking for strictly less than 7
        numbers.add(3);


        // Method 1: Using headSet()  (Most efficient for TreeSets)
        System.out.println("Numbers less than 7 (using headSet): " + numbers.headSet(7));


        // Method 2: Using enhanced for loop and conditional check
        System.out.print("Numbers less than 7 (using loop): ");
        for (int number : numbers) {
            if (number < 7) {
                System.out.print(number + " ");
            }
        }
        System.out.println(); // New line for better output formatting


        // Method 3: Using Java Streams (Java 8 and above) - more advanced
        System.out.print("Numbers less than 7 (using streams): ");
        numbers.stream()
               .filter(n -> n < 7)
               .forEach(n -> System.out.print(n + " "));
        System.out.println();

        // Explanation of headSet():
        /*
        The headSet(K toElement) method of TreeSet returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are strictly less than toElement.  
        It's very efficient because TreeSets are sorted, so it can quickly determine the appropriate subset. 
        */

Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

1. **Clarity and Comments:**  Added more comments explaining each method and the crucial `headSet()` method.
2. **Efficiency:** Highlighted that `headSet()` is the most efficient way to achieve this for TreeSets due to their sorted nature.
3. **Multiple Approaches:** Demonstrated multiple ways to accomplish the task (using `headSet()`, a loop, and Java Streams) to give a more comprehensive educational example.
4. **Output Formatting:** Improved output formatting for better readability.
5. **`7` Included in the Set:**  Added `7` to the set to explicitly show that `headSet(7)` *excludes* the upper bound (7 itself).
