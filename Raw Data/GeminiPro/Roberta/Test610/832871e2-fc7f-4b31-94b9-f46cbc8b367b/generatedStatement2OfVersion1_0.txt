Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

1. **Clarity and Comments:**  Added more comments explaining each method and the crucial `headSet()` method.
2. **Efficiency:** Highlighted that `headSet()` is the most efficient way to achieve this for TreeSets due to their sorted nature.
3. **Multiple Approaches:** Demonstrated multiple ways to accomplish the task (using `headSet()`, a loop, and Java Streams) to give a more comprehensive educational example.
4. **Output Formatting:** Improved output formatting for better readability.
5. **`7` Included in the Set:**  Added `7` to the set to explicitly show that `headSet(7)` *excludes* the upper bound (7 itself).
