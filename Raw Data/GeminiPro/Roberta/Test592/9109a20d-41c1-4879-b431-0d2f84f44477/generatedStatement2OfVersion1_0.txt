Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Comments:**  Added more comments to explain each approach and its implications.
2. **Efficiency Considerations:** Explained that `addAll()` is the most efficient way to join lists, especially for larger lists. Also explained the trade-off of using streams (good for demonstration, but may have more overhead).
3. **Copying vs. Modifying:**  Emphasized the difference between creating a copy of the original list and modifying it in place.  This avoids unexpected behavior.
4. **Multiple Methods:** Demonstrated several ways to achieve the same result, giving learners more options.
5. **Java 8+ Stream Example:** Included a modern Java approach using streams, demonstrating the flexibility of LinkedList operations.
6. **Clear Output:**  Formatted the output to make it easy to understand the results of each method.
