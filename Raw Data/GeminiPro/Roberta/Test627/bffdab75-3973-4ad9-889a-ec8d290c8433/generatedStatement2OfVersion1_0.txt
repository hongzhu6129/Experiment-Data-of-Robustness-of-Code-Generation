**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Empty TreeSet:** The code now includes checks using `treeSet.isEmpty()` to avoid exceptions if the `TreeSet` is empty before trying to get or remove the first element. This is crucial for robust code.

2. **Clear Explanation and Comments:** Added more comments to explain each step and method used, making the code more educational.

3. **Demonstrates `pollFirst()`:** Includes an example of using `pollFirst()`, which efficiently retrieves and removes the first element in a single operation.  It also shows how `pollFirst()` handles an empty `TreeSet` gracefully (by returning `null`).

4. **Illustrates `remove()`:** The code now demonstrates how to remove a specific element using `remove()`, which is more general than `pollFirst()` (as you might need to remove elements other than the first).

5. **Clearer Output:** Improved the output messages to be more informative and easier to understand.

6. **Uses Integer instead of int:** Using `Integer` instead of `int` for the `firstElement` allows us to compare the result of `pollFirst()` on an empty set to `null`.  Primitives like `int` cannot be `null`.


This improved version is more complete, robust, and easier to understand as a learning example. It covers different scenarios and methods for working with the first element of a `TreeSet`.
