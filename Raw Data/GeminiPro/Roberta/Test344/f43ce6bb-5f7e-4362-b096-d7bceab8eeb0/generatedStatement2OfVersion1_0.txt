This improved version includes:

1. **Error Handling:** It checks for `IndexOutOfBoundsException` by validating `startIndex` and `endIndex` against the string length and each other.  This prevents the program from crashing if incorrect indices are used.
2. **Clearer Output:** The output now explicitly states the original string and the extracted substring, making it easier to understand the results.
3. **Multiple Examples:** Demonstrates how the error handling works with various valid and invalid index combinations.
4. **Early Exit:** The `return` statement in the `if` block ensures the program exits gracefully if the indices are invalid, preventing further execution with potentially erroneous data.
