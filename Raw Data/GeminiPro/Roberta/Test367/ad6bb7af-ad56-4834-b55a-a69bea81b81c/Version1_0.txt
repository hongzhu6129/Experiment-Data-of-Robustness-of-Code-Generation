Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Character Counting Array:** Uses `count[]` (size 256 for all ASCII characters) for efficient character counting.  The original version used nested loops, which is less efficient.

2. **Factorial Calculation:** The `makefactorial()` method now calculates factorial iteratively which is a straightforward and efficient approach.

3. **Clearer Logic:** The main logic in `calcuLexicoRank()` is now streamlined and easier to follow. It correctly iterates through the string, updates the rank, and adjusts character counts.

4. **Handles Repeated Characters:** This version correctly handles strings with repeated characters. This was a significant issue in the earlier versions.  The sorted string logic isn't strictly necessary for the lexicographic rank calculation itself.

5. **More Test Cases in `main()`:**  Added various test cases, including strings with repeated characters and different lengths to demonstrate the code's correctness.



This revised code accurately calculates the lexicographic rank of a string, is more efficient, and handles edge cases correctly.  The comments and improved structure make it easier to understand the algorithm.
