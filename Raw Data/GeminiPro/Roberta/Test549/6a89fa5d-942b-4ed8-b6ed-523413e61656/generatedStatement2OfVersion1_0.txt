**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:**  The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that might occur if the file is not found or cannot be read.  This makes the code more robust.

2. **Resource Management:**  The `BufferedReader` is used inside a try-with-resources block (`try (...) { ... }`). This ensures that the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed even if exceptions occur, preventing resource leaks.

3. **ArrayList for Dynamic Sizing:**  The code uses an `ArrayList` to store the lines initially. `ArrayList` grows dynamically, which is important because we usually don't know the number of lines in a file beforehand.

4. **Conversion to Array:** After reading all the lines into the `ArrayList`,  the code converts it to a `String[]` using `lines.toArray(new String[0])`.  This creates a new array of the correct size and copies the elements from the list.


**How to Use:**

1. **Create a text file:**  Create a text file named `your_file.txt` (or any name you prefer) in the same directory as your Java file or provide the full path to the file.
2. **Add content:** Put some text into the file, with each line representing a separate entry you want in the array.
3. **Compile and run:** Compile and run the Java code. The output will be the contents of the file, printed as a String array.
