Explanation and Improvements:

1. HashMap Approach:  This code uses a `HashMap` to store the frequency of each number in the array.  This is a clear and educational approach as it demonstrates a fundamental data structure.

2. Handles Edge Cases: I've added a check at the beginning of `getSingleNumber` to handle `null` or empty input arrays. This makes the code more robust. You can choose to return 0 or throw an exception as needed.  Illustrative examples are in `main`.

3.  Clear Comments: The code is well-commented to explain the logic, especially the use of `getOrDefault`.

4. Efficient Return:  Once the number with a count of 1 is found, the function immediately returns it, avoiding unnecessary iterations.

5. Educational Value:  This approach focuses on clarity and understanding the steps involved, making it suitable for an educational context.  It avoids more complex (though potentially more performant in terms of Big O) solutions like bitwise XOR, which might be confusing for beginners.


Why this is a good educational solution:

* Demonstrates use of HashMap: This introduces a key data structure for storing and retrieving data based on keys.
* Step-by-step logic: The code follows a logical flow: count occurrences, then find the number with count 1.  This makes it easy to follow and understand.
* Handles edge cases: Robustness with null or empty input is important to show good practice.
* Clear and concise:  The code is well-formatted and not overly complex, making it easy to read and learn from.
