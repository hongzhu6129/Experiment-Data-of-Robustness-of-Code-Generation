Key improvements in the revised code:

* **Error Handling:** Includes `try-catch` blocks to handle potential `NumberFormatException` (if the input is not a valid number) and `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`(if not enough numbers are provided), making the code more robust.
* **Flexibility (Optional Helper Function):** The `calculateAndPrintSum` function is more flexible and can handle different separators (not just spaces) and other operators.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `num1`, `num2`, `operator` etc., improves readability.
* **Regex for Robust Splitting:**  The regular expression `[^\\d-]+` is used for splitting. This is more flexible and accounts for any non-digit characters, making it less prone to errors compared to just splitting by spaces. It also correctly handles negative numbers by including "-" in the acceptable characters.
* **Handles multiple operations:** The optional helper function shows how the program can handle various mathematical operators like "+", "-", "*", "/".


This improved version demonstrates better coding practices, making it more robust, flexible, and easier to understand.
