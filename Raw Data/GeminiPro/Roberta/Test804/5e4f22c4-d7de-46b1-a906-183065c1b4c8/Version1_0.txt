```java
public class AmericanFlag {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Print the striped section
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) { // Even rows: stars and stripes
                for (int j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
                    System.out.print("* ");
                }
                System.out.print(" "); // Space between stars and stripes
                System.out.println("==================================");
            } else { // Odd rows: just stripes
                for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
                    System.out.print("* ");
                }
                System.out.print(" "); // Space between stars and stripes
                System.out.println("==================================");

            }
        }

        // Print the red stripes only section
        for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            System.out.println("==================================");
        }
    }
}

This code directly addresses the prompt's specific output format within the constraints of a single `main` method.   Key improvements include:

* **Correct Star and Stripe Pattern:**  Accurately reproduces the alternating rows of 6 and 5 stars, followed by the stripes.
* **Consistent Spacing:** Uses a loop and `System.out.print("* ")` to maintain consistent spacing between stars.  An extra space is added between the stars and stripes.
* **Clear Separation of Sections:**  Clearly separates the logic for the starred stripes and the solid stripes sections.
* **Simplified Logic:** Uses the modulo operator (`%`) to effectively alternate between the two row types.


This revised answer provides a much more accurate and cleaner solution directly within the limitations of a single `main` method, as requested.
