There is no standard "beside" operation for ArrayLists in Java like there might be in some matrix-based languages. I've provided interpretations of what "beside" could mean in the context of ArrayLists (combining/concatenating, or creating a nested list structure). The code demonstrates both approaches. Choose the method that best suits your intended meaning of "beside."
