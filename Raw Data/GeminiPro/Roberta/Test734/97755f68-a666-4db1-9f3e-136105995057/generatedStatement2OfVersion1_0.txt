**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Saddleback Search Implementation:** The `Saddleback` method efficiently searches the 2D array.  It starts at the top right corner and moves either down or left based on the comparison with the target.  This leverages the sorted nature of rows and columns.

2. **Clearer Return Value:**  The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` of size 2.  If the element is found, the array contains the row and column indices. If not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`, making it easy for the `main` method to determine the outcome.

3. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to call the `Saddleback` method and handles the case where the target is not found.

4. **Added Test Case:** Included a second test case in `main` searching for a value not present in the array to show the not found handling.

5. **Comments and Clarity:** Added comments to explain the logic within the `Saddleback` method.


This improved version addresses the prompts requirements, provides better clarity, and handles the not-found case robustly.
