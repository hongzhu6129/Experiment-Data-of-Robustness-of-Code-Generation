Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:**  The code strictly adheres to the required `main` and `Saddleback` method signatures.
* **Saddleback Search Implementation:** The `Saddleback` method correctly implements the saddleback search algorithm. It starts at the top-right corner of the matrix and efficiently navigates towards the target by leveraging the sorted properties of rows and columns.
* **Return Value:** `Saddleback` returns an `int[]` where the first element is the row index and the second is the column index.  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}` to indicate failure.
* **Error Handling:** The `main` method now handles the case where the target is not found, providing a user-friendly message.
* **Example Usage and Testing:** The `main` method includes example usage with different target values (one present in the array and one not present), demonstrating how to call `Saddleback` and interpret the results.
* **Comments:**  Comments explain the logic, making the code easier to understand.
