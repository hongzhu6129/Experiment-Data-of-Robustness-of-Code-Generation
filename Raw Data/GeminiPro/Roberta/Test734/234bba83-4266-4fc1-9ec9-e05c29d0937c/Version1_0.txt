    private static int[] Saddleback(int[][] matrix, int target, int m, int n) {

        int col = n - 1;

        while (row < m && col >= 0) {
            if (matrix[row][col] == target) {
                return new int[]{row, col}; // Target found
            } else if (matrix[row][col] < target) {
                row++; // Move down to the next row
            } else {
                col--; // Move left to the previous column

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `m` and `n` for dimensions makes the code easier to understand.

2. **Return an Array:** The `Saddleback` function now returns an `int[]` containing the row and column index. This allows us to return both values and indicate "not found" using {-1, -1}.

3. **Simplified Logic:**  The search logic is now more concise and follows the saddleback search algorithm effectively. We start at the top-right corner and move either down or left depending on the comparison with the target.

4. **Error Handling:** The `main` method now checks if the target was found using the returned array and prints an appropriate message.


**How Saddleback Search Works:**

The saddleback search (or staircase search) leverages the sorted property of the matrix.  Starting from the top-right corner:

- If the current element is *smaller* than the target, we know the target cannot be in that row (because the row is sorted in ascending order), so we move down to the next row.
- If the current element is *larger* than the target, we know the target cannot be in that column (because the column is sorted in ascending order), so we move left to the previous column.
- We continue this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space (meaning the target is not present).


This approach is efficient, having a time complexity of O(m + n), where 'm' is the number of rows and 'n' is the number of columns. This is because in each step, we eliminate either a row or a column from our search space.
