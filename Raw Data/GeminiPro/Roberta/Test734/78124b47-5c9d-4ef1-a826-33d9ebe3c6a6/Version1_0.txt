**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clear Method Signatures:** The code adheres strictly to the requested method signatures: `main` and `Saddleback`.
2. **Saddleback Search Algorithm:**  The `Saddleback` method correctly implements the saddleback search (or staircase search) algorithm. It starts from the top-right corner of the matrix.
   - If the current element is equal to the target, the position is returned.
   - If the current element is smaller than the target, move down to the next row (because elements increase along rows).
   - If the current element is larger than the target, move left to the previous column (because elements increase along columns).
3. **Return int[]:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` to hold the row and column indices of the target.  If the target isn't found, `{-1, -1}` is returned for easy checking in `main`.
4. **Example Usage in main():** The `main` method demonstrates how to use `Saddleback` and handles cases where the target is found and not found.
5. **Comments and Clarity:**  Comments have been added to explain the logic.  The code is formatted for readability.


**How Saddleback Search Works (Example):**

Let's say `target = 5` in the sample array:

1. Start at `arr[0][2]` (value 3).  3 < 5, so move down.
2. Now at `arr[1][2]` (value 6). 6 > 5, so move left.
3. Now at `arr[1][1]` (value 5).  5 == 5, so return {1, 1} (row 1, column 1).


This algorithm is efficient for sorted matrices because it eliminates parts of the matrix with each comparison. It has a time complexity of O(m + n), where 'm' is the number of rows and 'n' is the number of columns.
