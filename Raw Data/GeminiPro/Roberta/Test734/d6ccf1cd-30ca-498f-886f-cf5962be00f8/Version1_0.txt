        int[][] arr = {
                {1, 4, 7, 11, 15},
                {2, 5, 8, 12, 19},
                {3, 6, 9, 16, 22},

            } else if (arr[row][col] < target) {
                row++; // Move down to the next row
            } else {
                col--; // Move left to the previous column

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Saddleback Search Algorithm:** The `Saddleback` (or Saddleback Search) method efficiently searches a sorted 2D array.  It starts from the top-right corner.
   - If the current element is equal to the target, the search is successful.
   - If the current element is smaller than the target, move down to the next row (because elements increase as you move down).
   - If the current element is larger than the target, move left to the previous column (because elements decrease as you move left).

2. **Return an `int[]`:** The `Saddleback` method now returns an `int[]` of size 2.  The array contains the row and column indices of the target if found. If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.  This is a standard way to indicate that the element is not present.

3. **Clearer Main Method:** The `main` method is more concise and demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` method and interpret its results.

4. **Error Handling:**  The `main` method now checks the result from `Saddleback` and prints an appropriate message whether the element is found or not.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SaddlebackSearch.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:
   ```bash
   javac SaddlebackSearch.java
   ```
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the code:
   ```bash
   java SaddlebackSearch 
   ```
