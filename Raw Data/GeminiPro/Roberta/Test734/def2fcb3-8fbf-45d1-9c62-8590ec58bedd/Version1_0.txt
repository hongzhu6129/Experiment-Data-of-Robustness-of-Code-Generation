Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature:** The `Saddleback` method's signature now includes `m` and `n` (dimensions of the array) as parameters, making the code more readable and less reliant on accessing `arr.length` and `arr[0].length` internally.  This is better practice when the dimensions might not be immediately obvious from the calling context.

2. **Returns an `int[]`:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` of size 2 to represent the row and column index. This is much cleaner than relying on output parameters or printing within the method.  A `{-1, -1}` return indicates the target wasn't found.

3. **Enhanced `main` method:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` method effectively and includes a test case where the target value is *not* present in the array.

4. **Concise Comments:** Comments explain the logic clearly.

5. **Error Handling:**  Returns `{-1, -1}` if the target is not found, providing a way for the calling function to handle the case where the target isn't in the array.


How the Saddleback Search works:

The algorithm starts at the top-right corner of the matrix.  It then compares the current element with the target:

* **If they are equal:** The target is found.
* **If the current element is smaller:**  The target cannot be in the current row (because rows are sorted ascending), so move down to the next row.
* **If the current element is larger:** The target cannot be in the current column (because columns are sorted ascending), so move left to the previous column.


This process continues until the target is found or the boundaries of the matrix are crossed (meaning the target is not present).
