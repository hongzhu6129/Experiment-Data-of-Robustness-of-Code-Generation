**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clear Method Signatures:** The code adheres strictly to the requested `main` and `Saddleback` method signatures.

2. **Saddleback Search Algorithm:** The `Saddleback` function efficiently searches the sorted 2D array. It starts from the top-right corner.  If the current element is smaller than the target, it moves down (to a larger element).  If the current element is larger than the target, it moves left (to a smaller element).

3. **Return Array for Coordinates:**  The `Saddleback` function returns an `int[]` to represent the row and column indices of the target. If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.

4. **Clear Output:**  The `main` function provides clear output indicating whether the target was found and its coordinates.

5. **Example Usage:** The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function with a sample matrix and target value.

6. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic and improve readability.




**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SaddlebackSearch.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then compile using: `javac SaddlebackSearch.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code: `java SaddlebackSearch`


This improved version addresses the requirements, is more efficient, and is easier to understand and use.
