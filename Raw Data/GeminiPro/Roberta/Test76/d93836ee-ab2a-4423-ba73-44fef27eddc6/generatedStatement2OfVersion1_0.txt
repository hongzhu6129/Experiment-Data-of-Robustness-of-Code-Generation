Here's how the code works:

1. **`print_number(int n)`:** This method takes an integer `n` (assumed to be between 0 and 9) and prints the English word for that digit.

2. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - Reads an integer input `num` from the user.
   - Calculates the sum of the digits of `num`.
   - Iterates through the digits of `sumOfDigits` (from right to left).
   - For each digit, calls `print_number()` to print the English representation.

**Example Usage:**

If the input is `12345`, the sum of digits is `1+2+3+4+5 = 15`. The output will be:
