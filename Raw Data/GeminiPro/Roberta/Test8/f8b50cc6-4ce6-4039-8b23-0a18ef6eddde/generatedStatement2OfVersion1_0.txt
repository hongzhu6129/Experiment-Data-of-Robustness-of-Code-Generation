**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Class Structure:**  The code is now organized into a `Rectangle` class, which is a more object-oriented and reusable approach.

2. **Constructor:**  A constructor is included to initialize the `length` and `width` when a `Rectangle` object is created.

3. **Methods:** Separate methods (`calculateArea` and `calculatePerimeter`) are defined for calculating the area and perimeter. This improves code readability and organization.

4. **Test Cases:** The `main` method now includes several test cases, demonstrating the usage of the class and covering various scenarios:
   - Normal rectangle
   - Rectangles with zero length or width
   - Rectangle with zero length and width
   - Rectangles with negative length or width (These are corner cases that might need special handling in a real application, like throwing an exception or using absolute values).
   - Rectangle with a very large dimension (to test for potential overflow issues if calculations were more complex).

5. **Helper Function:** The `printRectangleDetails` function is introduced to avoid code duplication and keep the `main` method cleaner.

6. **Handling Invalid Input (Optional but Recommended):**  Consider adding checks within the `Rectangle` class to handle invalid input (like negative length or width) gracefully. You could throw an `IllegalArgumentException` or handle it in another way appropriate for your application. For example:
