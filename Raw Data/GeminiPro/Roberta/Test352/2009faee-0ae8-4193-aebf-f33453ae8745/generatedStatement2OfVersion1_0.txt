**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`main` Method:** This method now takes the input string ("abc" in the example). You can easily modify this to accept input from the user or other sources.

2. **`permutationWithRepeation` Method:** This method initiates the permutation generation by calling `showPermutation` with the input string and an empty prefix.

3. **`showPermutation` Method (Recursive):**
   - **Base Case:** When the `prefix` length equals the input string's length, a permutation is complete, so it's printed.
   - **Recursive Step:** It iterates through each character of the input string. In each iteration, it adds the current character to the `prefix` and makes a recursive call to `showPermutation`. This explores all possible combinations with repetition.

**Example Output (for "abc"):**
