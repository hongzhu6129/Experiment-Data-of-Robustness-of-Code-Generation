```java
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.GregorianCalendar;

public class DateExceeds {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the current date and time using the default calendar (GregorianCalendar)
        Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar();

        // Get the current year, month, week of year, and day of month
        int currentYear = calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR);
        int currentMonth = calendar.get(Calendar.MONTH); // Note: Month is 0-indexed (0 = January)
        int currentWeekOfYear = calendar.get(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR);
        int currentDayOfMonth = calendar.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);

        // Calculate the "exceeds" values.  Interpreting "exceeds" to mean 
        // "the amount by which the current value exceeds the minimum possible value."
        int yearExceeds = currentYear - 1; // Years start at 1 (though not in Gregorian calendar, but conceptually)
        int monthExceeds = currentMonth;   // Months are 0-indexed, so the current month *is* the exceeds value.
        int weekExceeds = currentWeekOfYear - 1; // Weeks of year start at 1.
        int dayExceeds = currentDayOfMonth - 1; // Days of month start at 1.


        // Print the results
        System.out.println("Current Date Information:");
        System.out.println("Year: " + currentYear + ", Exceeds: " + yearExceeds);
        System.out.println("Month: " + (currentMonth + 1) + ", Exceeds: " + monthExceeds); // Add 1 to month for human readability
        System.out.println("Week of Year: " + currentWeekOfYear + ", Exceeds: " + weekExceeds);
        System.out.println("Day of Month: " + currentDayOfMonth + ", Exceeds: " + dayExceeds);
    }
}
```


Key improvements in this code:

* **Clearer Comments:**  Explains what "exceeds" means in this context and why the calculations are done the way they are.  Especially important for the month, which is 0-indexed.
* **Human-Readable Month:** Adds 1 to the month value when printing it so that the output shows months from 1 to 12.
* **Uses `GregorianCalendar` Explicitly (Optional but Good Practice):**  While the default calendar is usually `GregorianCalendar`, it's better to be explicit.
* **Correct Calculation of "Exceeds":** The logic for calculating the "exceeds" value is now aligned with the provided interpretation.


This revised version addresses the previous issues and makes the code more understandable and robust.
