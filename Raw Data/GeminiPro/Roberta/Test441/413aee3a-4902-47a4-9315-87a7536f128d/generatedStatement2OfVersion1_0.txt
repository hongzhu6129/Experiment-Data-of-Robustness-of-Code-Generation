**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Holiday List:** The code now defines a sample list of holidays. You should replace these with the specific holidays you want to consider.

2. **ISO 8601 Week Number:** The code now uses `ChronoField.ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR` to get the ISO 8601 week number, which is a more standard way to represent weeks.

3. **Handles Current Date:**  The code now correctly initializes the minimum values with the current date's year, month, week, and day.

4. **Iterates and Compares:**  The loop iterates through the holidays and updates the minimum values as needed.

5. **Clear Output:** The results are printed in a user-friendly format.


**Example Usage and Output (will vary depending on the current date and the holidays you define):**

If the current date is, for example, October 26, 2024, and you use the provided sample holidays, the output might be:
