Key improvements/explanations:

* **Clarity and Explanation:** Added comments to explain the purpose of each line and the 0-based indexing of the month.  Also, explained why setting YEAR to the actual minimum likely has no effect (unless you're working with dates before the Java epoch).
* **Demonstration:**  Showed how you could actually *use* the minimum values to set the `Calendar` object.
* **`getActualMinimum()`:** Used the correct `getActualMinimum()` method of the `Calendar` class to get the minimum possible values for the specified fields.  These minimum values are context-dependent (e.g., the minimum day of the month depends on the month and year).
* **Output Formatting:**  Improved the output format to make it clear what each value represents.
* **`getTime()`:** Included `calendar.getTime()` to demonstrate the effect of setting the calendar fields.  This prints the date in a human-readable format.
* **`WEEK_OF_YEAR` Clarification:** Added a note explaining why setting `WEEK_OF_YEAR` directly might not have the desired result and is typically less useful.


This revised answer is more complete, well-explained, and demonstrates how to use the obtained minimum values.
