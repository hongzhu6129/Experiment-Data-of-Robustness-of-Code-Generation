```java
public class Ramanujan {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1729; // Example: Check up to 1729 (the Hardy-Ramanujan number)

        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i * i * i < a; i++) {
                int a3 = i * i * i;
                int b3 = a - a3;
                int b = (int) Math.round(Math.cbrt(b3)); // Calculate integer cube root

                if (b * b * b == b3) { // Check if b3 is a perfect cube
                    for (int j = i + 1; j * j * j < a; j++) {
                        int c3 = j * j * j;
                        int d3 = a - c3;
                        int d = (int) Math.round(Math.cbrt(d3)); // Calculate integer cube root
                        if (d * d * d == d3) { // Check if d3 is a perfect cube
                            count++;
                            if(count == 1) { // only print the number 'a' once it has been established as the sum of two cubes in two different ways
                                System.out.println(a + " can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two (or more) different ways.");
                                break; // no need to continue searching for more ways for this specific 'a'
                            }
                        }

                    }
                }
                if (count > 0) break; // Exit inner loop if a solution is found for the current 'a' value
            }
           
        }
    }
}
```


This improved code directly addresses the problem statement's core requirement: finding a number expressible as the sum of two cubes in *two or more* distinct ways.  It efficiently avoids redundant calculations and prints each such number only once.  The `break` statements optimize the search by stopping the inner loops when a solution is found or the inner loop can no longer find an integer cube root.
