Key Improvements in this version:

* **Handles Negative Numbers:** Correctly checks for cube roots of negative numbers.
* **More Efficient Cube Root Calculation:** Uses binary search (much faster for large numbers) instead of a simple loop.  Crucial for performance if large inputs are possible.
* **Edge Case Handling:** Includes test cases for 0 and negative inputs.
* **Clearer Main Method:**  Demonstrates how to call the `isCube()` method and interpret the result with several example inputs.
* **Helper Function:** Encapsulates the cube checking logic in a separate `isCube()` method for better code organization and reusability.
* **Handles Potential Overflow:**  Uses `low + (high - low) / 2` to calculate the midpoint in binary search, avoiding potential integer overflow issues.



This improved version addresses efficiency, correctness for negative numbers, and better code structure.
