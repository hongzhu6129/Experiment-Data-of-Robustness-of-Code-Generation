```java
public class CubeChecker {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Input data (hardcoded for this example, could be read from user input)
        int num = 8; 

        if (isCube(num)) {
            System.out.println("Number is a cube.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number is not a cube.");
        }
    }

    private static boolean isCube(int num) {
        if (num < 0) { // Handle negative numbers by checking the cube of their absolute value
            return isCube(-num); 
        } else if (num == 0) {
             return true; // 0 is a perfect cube
        }

        // Efficiently check for perfect cube using integer arithmetic
        int cubeRoot = Math.round(Math.cbrt(num));  // Calculate the integer cube root
        return cubeRoot * cubeRoot * cubeRoot == num; // Check if the cube of the integer root equals the original number

    }
}
```


Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The code now correctly handles negative numbers.  A negative number is a perfect cube if its absolute value is a perfect cube.

2. **Handles Zero:** Explicitly checks if the number is 0, as 0 is a perfect cube.

3. **Efficient Cube Root Calculation:** Uses `Math.cbrt()` to compute the cube root efficiently. `Math.round()` is used to round the result to the nearest integer. This approach avoids iterating through possible cube roots, which is less efficient, especially for large numbers.

4. **Clearer Output:** The output messages are more descriptive, indicating whether the number is or isn't a cube.

5. **Helper Function:** The `isCube()` method encapsulates the cube-checking logic, making the `main` method cleaner and easier to understand.

6. **Integer Arithmetic:** The code uses integer arithmetic for the cube root check to avoid potential floating-point precision issues.


Example Usage and Output (with the hardcoded `num = 8`):

```
Number is a cube. 
```


If you change `num` to 9:
```
Number is not a cube.
```
