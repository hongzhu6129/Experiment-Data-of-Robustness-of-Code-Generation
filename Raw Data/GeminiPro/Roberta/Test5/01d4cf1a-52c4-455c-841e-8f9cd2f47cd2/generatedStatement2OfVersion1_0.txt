**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases designed to cover various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input 1 | Input 2 | Input 3 | Expected Output | Notes                                   |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1        | 10      | 20      | 30      | 20.0           | General positive numbers                 |
| 2        | -5      | 0       | 5       | 0.0            | Including negative and zero              |
| 3        | 0       | 0       | 0       | 0.0            | All zeros                               |
| 4        | 1.5     | 2.5     | 3.5     | 2.5            | Decimal numbers                         |
| 5        |         |          |          | *InputMismatchException*      | Empty input (handle this gracefully)   |  // Important!
| 6        | "abc"   |          |          | *InputMismatchException*      | Non-numeric input (handle this gracefully) | // Important!
| 7       | Double.MAX_VALUE | Double.MAX_VALUE | Double.MAX_VALUE | Infinity or Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY |  Overflow check (handle this in code if needed) |
| 8       | Double.MIN_VALUE | Double.MIN_VALUE | Double.MIN_VALUE | Double.MIN_VALUE or a very small number | Underflow (less critical but good to check)|




**How to Run and Test:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `AverageCalculator.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac AverageCalculator.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java AverageCalculator`
4. **Input:** Enter the three numbers when prompted.

**Handling Corner Cases (Robustness):**

The provided code is functional for most valid numeric inputs. However, to make it more robust, especially in production code, you should handle potential exceptions:

* **InputMismatchException:** This occurs when the user enters non-numeric input.
* **Overflow/Underflow:** Although less common with `double`, it's good practice to be aware of the possibility of overflow/underflow with extreme values.
