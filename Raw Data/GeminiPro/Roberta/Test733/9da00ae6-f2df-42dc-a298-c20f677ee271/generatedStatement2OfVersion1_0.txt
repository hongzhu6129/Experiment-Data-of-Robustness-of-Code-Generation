Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `mid1` and `mid2` are more descriptive than `m1` and `m2`.
* **Enhanced Readability:** Consistent spacing and indentation make the code easier to follow.
* **Comprehensive Comments:**  Comments explain the logic behind each section.
* **Error Handling:** The function returns -1 when the element is not found, which is a standard practice for search algorithms.
* **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `ternary_search` function and handles the result appropriately.  It also includes a test case where the target element is *not* in the array to demonstrate the error handling.




This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and adheres to better coding practices.
