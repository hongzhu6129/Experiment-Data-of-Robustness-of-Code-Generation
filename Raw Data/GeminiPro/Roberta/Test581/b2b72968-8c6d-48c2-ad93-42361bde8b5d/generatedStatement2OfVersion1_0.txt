Key points explained in the code and comments:

1. **Creating a LinkedList:** `LinkedList<String> myList = new LinkedList<>();` creates a new LinkedList that will store String objects.  You can change `<String>` to other types like `<Integer>`, `<Double>`, or even custom objects.

2. **Inserting at the beginning (head):**
   - `addFirst("element")`:  Adds the specified element to the beginning of the list.
   - `push("element")`: This is equivalent to `addFirst()` and also inserts at the beginning.

3. **Inserting at the end (tail):**
   - `addLast("element")`: Adds the specified element to the end of the list.
   - `add("element")`:  When used with a LinkedList, this is equivalent to `addLast()` and adds to the end.

4. **Printing the list:** `System.out.println(myList);` directly prints the contents of the LinkedList.

5. **Iterating and Accessing:** The `for` loop demonstrates how to iterate through the LinkedList using an index and `myList.get(i)` to retrieve elements.

6. **Removing elements:**  `removeFirst()` and `removeLast()` are used to remove and return the first and last elements, respectively.  This is included to provide a more complete example of common LinkedList operations.
