Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes robust error handling for `null` or empty arrays, `k` values less than or equal to zero, and `k` values greater than the array size. This makes the code more resilient to unexpected inputs.
2. **Min-Heap using PriorityQueue:** The core logic uses a `PriorityQueue` which implements a min-heap data structure.  This provides efficient retrieval of the smallest element, which is crucial for maintaining the k largest elements.
3. **Clear Comments:**  Comments explain the purpose of key parts of the code.
4. **Concise Output:**  The k largest elements are printed in a clean, readable format using `Arrays.toString()`.
5. **Testability:** The `main` method includes multiple test cases demonstrating normal operation and edge cases. This makes it easier to verify the correctness of the code.


This improved version is more robust, efficient, and readable, making it a better solution for finding the k largest elements in an array.
