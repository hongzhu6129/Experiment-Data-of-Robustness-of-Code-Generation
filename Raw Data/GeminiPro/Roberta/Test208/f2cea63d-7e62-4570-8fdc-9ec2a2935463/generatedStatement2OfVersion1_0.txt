**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Node Class:**  A `Node` class is defined to represent the nodes of the binary tree.  Each node stores its data and references to its left and right children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):**
   - **Base Case:** If `node` is `null` (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Calls:**  Recursively calculate the depth of the left and right subtrees.
   - **Return Max + 1:** The depth of the current node is the maximum of the depths of its left and right subtrees, plus 1 (for the current node itself).

3. **main Method:**
   - Creates instances of the `MaxDepthBinaryTree` and `Node` classes to build example trees.
   - Calls the `maxDepth()` method to calculate and print the height (maximum depth) of the trees.
   - **Added Test Cases:** The `main` method now includes several test cases (empty tree, single-node tree, more complex trees) to demonstrate that the `maxDepth()` method works correctly in various scenarios.  This is good practice for thorough testing.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `MaxDepthBinaryTree.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler:
