**Test Cases:**

1. **Valid Binary Input:**
   - Input: `1101`
   - Expected Output: `Hexadecimal value: 'd'`
   - Input: `101010`
   - Expected Output: `Hexadecimal value: '2a'`
   - Input: `11111111`
   - Expected Output: `Hexadecimal value: 'ff'`


2. **Invalid Binary Input (Non-binary characters):**
   - Input: `110a`
   - Expected Output: `Invalid binary input.`
   - Input: `101201`
   - Expected Output: `Invalid binary input.`


3. **Boundary Cases:**
   - Input: `0`
   - Expected Output: `Hexadecimal value: '0'`  (Handles the zero case)
   - Input: `1`
   - Expected Output: `Hexadecimal value: '1'`
   - Input: (Empty string)
   - Expected Output: Depending on how Scanner handles this, either an error message or a hex value of 0 (ideally an error message but can be treated as 0 if input validation isn't done before processing). Check how your Scanner behaves!


4. **Large Binary Input:**
   - Input: `1111111111111111` (16 ones)
   - Expected Output: `Hexadecimal value: 'ffff'`



This improved version includes error handling for invalid binary input (non-binary digits) and specifically addresses the case where the input binary string represents 0.  It also has more comprehensive test cases.  The try-catch block protects against `NumberFormatException` which could occur if the input was very large and led to issues with `Math.pow`. However,  for extremely large inputs that exceed `Integer.MAX_VALUE` after conversion to decimal, you'd need to use `BigInteger` for more robust handling.  This example focuses on the core conversion logic within the constraints of the question (using `main` and basic data types where practical).
