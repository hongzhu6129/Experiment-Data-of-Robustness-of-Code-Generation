```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        double num1 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        double num2 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Sum: " + (num1 + num2));
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (num1 - num2));
        System.out.println("Product: " + (num1 * num2));

        if (num2 != 0) { // Check for division by zero
            System.out.println("Quotient: " + (num1 / num2));
            System.out.println("Remainder: " + (num1 % num2));
        } else {
            System.out.println("Division by zero is not allowed.");
        }

        input.close(); // Close the scanner to release resources
    }
}
```


**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner cases, to test the program thoroughly:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (Positive Integers) | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 2 (Negative Integers) | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 3 (Mixed Signs) | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2.0 | 0.0 |
| 4 (Zero as num2 - Subtraction & Multiplication) | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | Division by zero error | Division by zero error |
| 5 (Zero as num1) | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 6 (Zero as both) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Division by zero error | Division by zero error |
| 7 (Floating-Point Numbers) | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13.0 | 8.0 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0.0 |
| 8 (Large Numbers) | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 9 (Small Numbers) | 0.001 | 0.002 | 0.003 | -0.001 | 0.000002 | 0.5 | 0.0 |
| 10 (Division by a small number approaching zero) | 1 | 0.000001 | 1.000001 | 0.999999 | 0.000001 | 1000000.0 | 0.0 |


**How to run the tests:**

You can manually input these test cases into the program or write automated tests using JUnit (a testing framework for Java).  JUnit would be the preferred approach for a more robust testing process.  An example using JUnit is a bit more involved than this basic answer, but highly recommended for real-world projects.


**Key Improvements in the code:**

* **Handles Division by Zero:**  The code now explicitly checks for division by zero and prints an appropriate message.
* **Uses `double` for more precision:**  Using `double` instead of `int` allows for calculations with floating-point numbers and provides more accurate results.
* **Closes the Scanner:**  `input.close()` releases the system resources used by the Scanner.
* **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted to be more readable.
