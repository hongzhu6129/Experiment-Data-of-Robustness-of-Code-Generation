```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        double num1 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        double num2 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Sum: " + (num1 + num2));
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (num1 - num2));
        System.out.println("Product: " + (num1 * num2));

        if (num2 != 0) {
            System.out.println("Quotient: " + (num1 / num2));
            System.out.println("Remainder: " + (num1 % num2));
        } else {
            System.out.println("Division by zero is not allowed.");
            // Or you could throw an ArithmeticException if you prefer:
            // throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero");
        }

        input.close(); 
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 3. Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2 | 0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | "Division by zero" | N/A |  *(Corner Case)*
| 6.  Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13.0 | 8.0 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0.0 |
| 7. Large Numbers | 1000000 | 1000 | 1001000 | 999000 | 1000000000 | 1000.0 | 0.0 |
| 8. Small Numbers | 0.001 | 0.002 | 0.003 | -0.001 | 0.000002 | 0.5 | 0.0 |
| 9. Integer Division | 10 | 3 | 13 | 7 | 30 | 3.3333333333333335 | 1.0 |


**Explanation of Corner Cases:**

* **Division by Zero (Test Case 5):**  Dividing by zero is undefined in mathematics and will cause an `ArithmeticException` in most programming languages. The provided code explicitly handles this by checking if `num2` is zero and printing an appropriate message. This prevents the program from crashing.


**How to run these test cases:**

While you can manually enter these values into the program,  a more systematic way to test is to use unit testing frameworks like JUnit. JUnit allows you to automate the testing process and verify the results programmatically.  Here's a simple example of a JUnit test:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class ArithmeticOperationsTest {

    @Test
    void testDivisionByZero() {
        ArithmeticOperations operations = new ArithmeticOperations();  // Not really needed in this case
        // In JUnit 5 you would assert that the output contains "Division by zero"
        // This would usually involve redirecting System.out to check.
        // Here's a simplified approach (not ideal, but demonstrates the idea).
        // A full example using System.setOut is beyond the scope of this basic demonstration.
       
         // You could throw an exception and assert that it's thrown:
       assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> {
            // Code that would throw the exception if num2 is zero.
           double result = 10 / 0;  // Example only. In real code, your method call.
        });
    }

    // Add more @Test methods for the other test cases.
}
```


Using JUnit (or similar frameworks) provides a much more robust and repeatable way to ensure your code is correct under various conditions.
