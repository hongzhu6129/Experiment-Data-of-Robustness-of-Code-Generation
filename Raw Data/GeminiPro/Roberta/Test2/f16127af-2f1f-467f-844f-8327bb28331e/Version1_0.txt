```java

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        double num1 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");

        System.out.println("Sum: " + (num1 + num2));
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (num1 - num2));
        System.out.println("Product: " + (num1 * num2));

        if (num2 != 0) {

**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Integers | 10 | 5 | Sum: 15.0<br>Difference: 5.0<br>Product: 50.0<br>Quotient: 2.0<br>Remainder: 0.0 |
| 2. Negative Integers | -10 | -5 | Sum: -15.0<br>Difference: -5.0<br>Product: 50.0<br>Quotient: 2.0<br>Remainder: 0.0 |
| 3. Positive and Negative Integers | 10 | -5 | Sum: 5.0<br>Difference: 15.0<br>Product: -50.0<br>Quotient: -2.0<br>Remainder: 0.0 |
| 4. Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | Sum: 13.0<br>Difference: 8.0<br>Product: 26.25<br>Quotient: 4.2<br>Remainder: 0.0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 (Division by Zero) | 10 | 0 | Sum: 10.0<br>Difference: 10.0<br>Product: 0.0<br>Division by zero is not allowed.<br>Remainder by zero is not allowed. |
| 6. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | Sum: 5.0<br>Difference: -5.0<br>Product: 0.0<br>Quotient: 0.0<br>Remainder: 0.0 |
| 7. Both Zero | 0 | 0 | Sum: 0.0<br>Difference: 0.0<br>Product: 0.0<br>Division by zero is not allowed.<br>Remainder by zero is not allowed. |
| 8. Large Numbers | 100000 | 5000 | Sum: 105000.0<br>Difference: 95000.0<br>Product: 5.0E8<br>Quotient: 20.0<br>Remainder: 0.0 |
| 9. Small Decimal Numbers | 0.001 | 0.002 | Sum: 0.003<br>Difference: -0.001<br>Product: 2.0E-6<br>Quotient: 0.5<br>Remainder: 0.0 |



**How to Run Test Cases:**

You can manually test these cases by inputting the values when prompted by the program.  For more automated testing, you could use JUnit or a similar testing framework.  This would involve writing separate test methods for each case and using assertions to verify that the output matches the expected results.


**Key Improvements in this Code:**

* **Handles Division by Zero:** The code now explicitly checks for division by zero and prints an appropriate message instead of crashing.
* **Uses `double` for More Precision:**  Using `double` allows for calculations involving decimal numbers.
* **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted for better readability.
* **Scanner Closed:** The `Scanner` is closed at the end to prevent resource leaks. This was missing in the original code.
