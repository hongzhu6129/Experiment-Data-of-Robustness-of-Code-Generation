Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Explanations:**  Added comments to explain each step and the logic.
* **Specific Month Example:**  Included an example showing how to get the last day of a specific month (October in this case).
* **User Input (Basic):** Added a basic example showing how you could get user input from the command line arguments to make it slightly more interactive.  I've included some rudimentary error handling (checking the input range and handling `NumberFormatException`), but a truly robust solution would need more thorough input validation.
* **java.time API:**  Continues to use the modern and preferred `java.time` API for date/time operations.


To compile and run this code (assuming you save it as `LastDayOfMonth.java`):


1. **Compile:** `javac LastDayOfMonth.java`
2. **Run (current month):** `java LastDayOfMonth`
3. **Run (specific month - e.g., June):** `java LastDayOfMonth 6`



This revised answer provides a more comprehensive and helpful solution to the problem of finding the last day of a month in Java.
