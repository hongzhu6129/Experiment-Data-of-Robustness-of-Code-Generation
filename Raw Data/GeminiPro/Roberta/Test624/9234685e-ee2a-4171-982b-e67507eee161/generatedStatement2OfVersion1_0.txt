This code demonstrates how to use the `floor()` method of the `TreeSet` class to find the greatest element less than or equal to a given element. It includes multiple examples to illustrate different scenarios, including when the element is present in the set, not present but has a floor, and smaller than any element in the set (resulting in `null`).  Clear comments explain the process.
