Explanation and Improvements:

1. Handles Edge Cases: The code now correctly handles empty arrays and single-element arrays (returning `true` in these cases, as there are no adjacent pairs to violate the condition).

2. Clearer Logic: The core logic is simplified.  It iterates through the array and checks if *either* element in each adjacent pair is equal to the specified number.  If *neither* is, it immediately returns `false`.

3. Improved Comments: The comments now provide better explanations of the logic and handle the edge case reasoning.

4. Example Usage in `main`:  The `main` method provides a variety of examples demonstrating how the `checkAdjacent` method behaves with different inputs, including cases where the number is present in all pairs, some pairs, and no pairs. This makes the educational aspect clearer.
