```java
public class CanonicalString {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // String literals are automatically interned (canonicalized)
        String str1 = "hello";
        String str2 = "hello";

        // Using the intern() method explicitly canonicalizes a string
        String str3 = new String("hello").intern();

        // Demonstrating that interned strings refer to the same object in memory
        if (str1 == str2) {
            System.out.println("str1 and str2 are the same object (interned literals)");
        }

        if (str1 == str3) {
            System.out.println("str1 and str3 are the same object (interned using intern())");
        }


        // Example showing the difference between == and .equals()
        String str4 = new String("hello"); // Not interned

        if (str1.equals(str4)) {
            System.out.println("str1 and str4 have the same content (.equals())");
        }

        if (str1 != str4) {
            System.out.println("str1 and str4 are different objects (not interned)"); // This will print
        }


        // Getting the canonical representation using intern()
        String str5 = "world";
        String canonicalStr5 = str5.intern(); //  Redundant in this specific example as str5 is already a literal.
        System.out.println("Canonical representation of \"world\": " + canonicalStr5);

        String str6 = new String("java");
        String canonicalStr6 = str6.intern(); 
        System.out.println("Canonical representation of \"java\" (created with new): " + canonicalStr6);

    }
}

Key points:

* **String Interning:** The Java String pool (part of the "String constant pool" in older versions) automatically stores unique string literals (like "hello").  This process is called *interning*. When you create a string literal, Java checks if that literal already exists in the pool. If it does, a reference to the existing string is returned; if not, a new string object is created in the pool and a reference to it is returned.
* **`intern()` method:** You can explicitly intern any string using the `intern()` method. This guarantees that you'll get the canonical representation of the string (the version from the string pool).
* **`==` vs. `equals()`:** The `==` operator checks for *reference equality* (whether two variables point to the same object in memory). The `equals()` method checks for *content equality* (whether the characters in two strings are the same).  For interned strings, both `==` and `equals()` will return `true`.  For non-interned strings with the same content, `==` will be `false`, but `equals()` will be `true`.
* **Canonical Representation:**  The canonical representation of a string is the version stored in the string pool.  The `intern()` method provides a way to obtain it.  String literals are automatically canonicalized.


The code demonstrates the concepts and clearly illustrates how to get the canonical representation of strings using `intern()` and the inherent interning of string literals.
