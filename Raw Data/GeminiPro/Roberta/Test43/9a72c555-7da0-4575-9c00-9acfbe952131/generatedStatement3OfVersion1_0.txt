This JUnit example shows how to capture and verify the output of your program.  You'd replace `/* Your expected output ... */` with the actual expected string, and add more `assertTrue` or other assertion methods as needed for each test case. This automated approach is much more efficient and reliable than manual testing, especially as your code becomes more complex.
