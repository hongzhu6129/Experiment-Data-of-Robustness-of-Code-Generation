```java
public class DivisibleBy3And5 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Numbers divisible by 3:");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
            }
        }
        System.out.println(); // Newline

        System.out.println("\nNumbers divisible by 5:");

            if (i % 5 == 0) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
            }
        }
        System.out.println(); // Newline


        System.out.println("\nNumbers divisible by both 3 and 5:");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
            }
        }

**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases to validate the program's output:

**1. Standard Cases:**

* **Input Range:** 1 to 100 (as specified)
* **Expected Output:**
    * Divisible by 3: 3 6 9 12 15 ... 99
    * Divisible by 5: 5 10 15 20 ... 100
    * Divisible by both: 15 30 45 60 75 90

**2. Boundary Cases:**

* **Input Range:** 0 to 1  (lower boundary)
* **Expected Output:**
    * Divisible by 3: (None)
    * Divisible by 5: (None)
    * Divisible by both: (None)

* **Input Range:** 99 to 101 (upper boundary check)
* **Expected Output:**
    * Divisible by 3: 99
    * Divisible by 5: 100
    * Divisible by both: (None)


**3. Empty Range:**

* **Input Range:** 101 to 200 (empty range within given limit)
* **Expected Output:**
    * Divisible by 3: (None)
    * Divisible by 5: (None)
    * Divisible by both: (None)

**4. Negative Numbers (although not strictly part of the problem):**

* **Input Range:** -10 to 10
* **Expected Output:**
    * Divisible by 3: -9 -6 -3 0 3 6 9
    * Divisible by 5: -10 -5 0 5 10
    * Divisible by both: 0



**How to Test:**

1. **Manual Inspection:** Run the code and visually compare the output with the expected values for each test case.
2. **Automated Tests (Recommended):**  Using a testing framework like JUnit is the best way to ensure correctness.  You can create test methods for each case:

   ```java
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
   import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
   import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
   import java.io.PrintStream;

   public class DivisibleBy3And5Test {

       @Test
       void testStandardRange() {
           // Capture System.out
           ByteArrayOutputStream outContent = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
           System.setOut(new PrintStream(outContent));

           DivisibleBy3And5.main(new String[]{}); // Run main

           String expectedOutput = // ... (Expected output for standard case)
           assertTrue(outContent.toString().contains("Numbers divisible by 3:"));
            // ... similar assertions for divisible by 5 and both
       }
        // ... other test methods for boundary, empty, and negative cases
   }

   ```

By using JUnit (or similar), you create robust tests that are easy to run and maintain as you update your code.  This is especially valuable for larger projects.
