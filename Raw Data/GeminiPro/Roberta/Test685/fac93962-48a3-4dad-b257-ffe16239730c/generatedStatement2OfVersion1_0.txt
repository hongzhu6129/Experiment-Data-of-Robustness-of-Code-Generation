**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `originalNumber` makes it easier to follow the logic and output.
2. **Handles Negative Numbers (second method):**  The  `StringBuilder` method now correctly handles negative input. We take the absolute value, reverse, then reapply the negative sign if needed.
3. **Integer Overflow Handling (second method):** The `try...catch` block demonstrates how to detect potential integer overflows, which can occur if the reversed number is too large to be stored as an `int`.
4. **Two Methods Demonstrated:** The code now shows two different reversal approaches:
   - The classic modulo/division method (more efficient, but doesn't automatically detect overflow).
   - The `StringBuilder` method (easier to read, and helps with overflow detection).  This method converts the number to a string, reverses it, and then back to an integer.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ReverseInteger.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run: `javac ReverseInteger.java`
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run: `java ReverseInteger`
