Key improvements and explanations in this code:

* **Three methods demonstrated:**  `putAll()`, constructor, and iteration.  `putAll()` is generally the most efficient. The constructor and `putAll()` produce shallow copies. Iteration can be adapted for deep copies if needed.
* **Shallow vs. Deep Copy Explanation:**  The code clearly demonstrates and explains the difference between shallow and deep copies. This is crucial for understanding how changes to the original TreeMap might affect the copied TreeMaps.
* **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted to be more readable, showing the method used for each copy and highlighting the effects of shallow copying.
* **Deep Copy Guidance:** The code includes a comment explaining how to create a deep copy if needed, which is important when dealing with mutable objects within the TreeMap.
* **Efficiency Note:**  The code mentions that `putAll()` is generally the most efficient approach.


This revised tutorial provides a more comprehensive and educational explanation of copying TreeMaps in Java.
