```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadFirstThreeLines {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = ""; // Replace with the actual file path

        if (args.length > 0) {
            filePath = args[0];  // Get file path from command-line arguments if provided
        } else {
            System.out.println("Please provide the file path as a command-line argument.");
            return; // Exit if no file path is given.
        }


        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                String line = reader.readLine();
                if (line == null) { // Check for end of file before printing
                    break;          // Exit loop if end of file is reached
                }
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading the file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Command-line Argument:** The code now accepts the file path as a command-line argument. This makes it more flexible, so you don't have to hardcode the file path in the program.  Run it like this:  `java ReadFirstThreeLines myfile.txt`

2. **Error Handling:** It includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that might occur if the file doesn't exist or there are permission issues.  The error message is printed to `System.err` (standard error) to distinguish it from regular output.

3. **End-of-File Check:** The code now checks for `null` after `reader.readLine()`. This handles cases where the file has fewer than three lines.  If the end of the file is reached before three lines are read, the loop breaks.

4. **Try-with-resources:** The `BufferedReader` is used inside a try-with-resources block.  This ensures that the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed, even if exceptions occur, preventing resource leaks.



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ReadFirstThreeLines.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler:
   ```bash
   javac ReadFirstThreeLines.java 
   ```
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code, providing the file path as a command-line argument:
   ```bash
   java ReadFirstThreeLines path/to/your/file.txt 
   ```
   Replace `path/to/your/file.txt` with the actual path to your file.


This improved version is more robust, handles errors gracefully, and is more user-friendly by accepting command-line arguments.
