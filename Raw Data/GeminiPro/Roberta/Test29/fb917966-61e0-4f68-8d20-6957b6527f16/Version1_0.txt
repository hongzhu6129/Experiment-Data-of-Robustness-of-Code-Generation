```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class HexagonArea {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the length of a side of the hexagon: ");
        double side = input.nextDouble();

        if (side <= 0) {
            System.out.println("Side length must be positive.");
        } else {
            double area = (3 * Math.sqrt(3) * side * side) / 2;
            System.out.printf("The area of the hexagon is: %.2f\n", area);
        }

        input.close(); // Close the scanner
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

1. **Positive Side Length:**
   - Input: `5`
   - Expected Output: `The area of the hexagon is: 64.95`

2. **Zero Side Length (Corner Case):**
   - Input: `0`
   - Expected Output: `Side length must be positive.`

3. **Negative Side Length (Corner Case):**
   - Input: `-3`
   - Expected Output: `Side length must be positive.`

4. **Small Side Length:**
   - Input: `0.5`
   - Expected Output: `The area of the hexagon is: 0.65`

5. **Large Side Length:**
   - Input: `100`
   - Expected Output: `The area of the hexagon is: 25980.76`

6. **Decimal Side Length:**
   - Input: `7.25`
   - Expected Output: `The area of the hexagon is: 135.59`


**Explanation of Corner Cases and Considerations:**

* **Zero or Negative Side Length:**  A hexagon cannot have a side length of zero or less.  The program correctly handles these cases by printing an error message.
* **Input Validation:**  The `if (side <= 0)` condition checks for invalid input and prevents the calculation from proceeding if the side length is not positive.  This is important for robustness.
* **Output Formatting:** The `printf` statement formats the output to two decimal places, making it more user-friendly.
* **Scanner Closure:** The `input.close()` statement closes the scanner to release system resources, which is good practice.


This improved version addresses error handling, uses more informative output, and includes closing the scanner, making it a more complete and robust solution.  The test cases cover a range of scenarios, including corner cases, to ensure the program functions correctly under different conditions.
