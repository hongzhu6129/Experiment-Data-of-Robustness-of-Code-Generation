```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class HexagonArea {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the length of a side of the hexagon: ");
        double side = input.nextDouble();

        if (side <= 0) {
            System.out.println("Side length must be positive.");
        } else {
            double area = (3 * Math.sqrt(3) * side * side) / 2;
            System.out.println("The area of the hexagon is: " + area);
        }
        input.close(); // Close the scanner

    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

1. **Positive Side Length:**
   - Input: `5`
   - Expected Output: `64.9519052838329` (approximately)

2. **Zero Side Length (Corner Case):**
   - Input: `0`
   - Expected Output: `Side length must be positive.`

3. **Negative Side Length (Corner Case):**
   - Input: `-3`
   - Expected Output: `Side length must be positive.`

4. **Small Side Length:**
   - Input: `0.5`
   - Expected Output: `0.649519052838329` (approximately)

5. **Large Side Length:**
   - Input: `100`
   - Expected Output: `25980.76211353316` (approximately)

6. **Decimal Side Length:**
   - Input: `2.75`
   - Expected Output: `19.225361650199822` (approximately)



**Explanation of Corner Cases and how they are handled:**

* **Zero Side Length:** A hexagon with a side length of zero doesn't exist, so the program should handle this case. The code checks if `side <= 0` and prints an error message if true.
* **Negative Side Length:**  A negative side length is also geometrically invalid. The code handles this the same way as the zero side length case.


**Improvements in the code:**

* **Input Validation:** The code now checks for invalid input (zero or negative side length) and provides a user-friendly error message.
* **Scanner Closure:** Added `input.close()` to release the scanner resource.  This is good practice to prevent resource leaks, although less critical in a simple program like this.
* **Clearer Output:** The output message is more descriptive.
* **Direct Calculation in `main`:**  The requirement to avoid methods other than `main` is met.  All the calculation is performed within `main`.


This improved version is more robust and provides a better user experience.  It addresses the corner cases and follows best practices for input handling.
