Key Improvements and Explanations:

1. **Using a Set:**  The `HashSet` is used to store the unique numbers.  Sets automatically handle duplicates, ensuring that only unique three-digit numbers are counted and printed.

2. **Clearer Logic:** The nested loops are now more explicitly checking for unique digits (`i != j && i != k && j != k`).

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `test()` function is introduced to systematically test the code with various inputs, including:
   - Standard case (4 unique digits)
   - All digits the same (corner case)
   - Fewer than 4 digits (corner case demonstrating permutations)
   - Some duplicate digits (corner case).
   - Additional tests with various digit sets.

4. **Error Handling in Tests:** The test cases now include error reporting so you can easily identify which tests fail and why.

5. **Conciseness and Readability:** The code is formatted and commented for improved readability.


How to Run:

1. Save the code as `UniqueThreeDigitNumbers.java`.
2. Compile: `javac UniqueThreeDigitNumbers.java`
3. Run: `java UniqueThreeDigitNumbers`


The output will show the unique three-digit numbers generated and the total count, followed by the results of the test cases.
