Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature:** Uses the specified `public int maxDepth(Node)` signature.
2. **Base Case:**  Handles the case where the input `node` is `null` (empty tree) by returning 0. This prevents `NullPointerExceptions` and is crucial for recursion to terminate correctly.
3. **Recursive Calls:**  Recursively calls `maxDepth` on the left and right subtrees to calculate their respective depths.
4. **Comparison and Return:** Compares the depths of the left and right subtrees and returns the larger depth + 1 (to account for the current node).
5. **Comprehensive `main` method:** Includes a `main` method with multiple test cases (a balanced tree, an empty tree, and a skewed tree) to demonstrate the correctness of the `maxDepth` method.  This helps with robust testing.
6. **Node Class:** Includes a simple `Node` class to represent the nodes of the binary tree, making the code self-contained and easier to understand.
