**Explanation of the Error and Solution**

The error "invalid literal for int() with base 10: '\r[|'" happens when you try to convert a string that isn't a valid integer (base 10) into an integer using `Integer.parseInt()`.  Characters like '\r' (carriage return), '[' and '|' are not valid digits.

The solution is to:


1. **Proper Input Handling:** The most common cause is issues with how you're reading input.  The provided code uses a `Scanner` and splits the input line by whitespace.  This handles cases where the invalid characters are mixed with valid integers on the same line.

2. **`try-catch` Block:** The `try-catch` block is crucial. Inside the `try` block, you attempt to convert the string to an integer. If `Integer.parseInt()` encounters an invalid character, it throws a `NumberFormatException`. The `catch` block handles this exception.

3. **Error Handling within the `catch`:**  You have several options in the `catch` block depending on how you want to deal with bad input:
   - **Skip the invalid part:**  Use `continue;`  to proceed to the next part of the input. This is the example in the provided code.
   - **Terminate the program:**  Use `return;` to stop the program entirely if any invalid input is encountered.
   - **Assign a default value:** Assign a default value (like -1 or 0) to the integer variable if the conversion fails. This allows your program to continue running even with bad input.
   - **Print an error message (as shown):** Inform the user that there was an issue with their input.


**How to Use the Code:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Main.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Compile the code using:  `javac Main.java`
3. **Run:** Run the compiled code: `java Main`
4. **Input:** Enter your input, pressing Enter after each line.  The program will process each line, handling any invalid integer inputs according to the error handling logic in the `catch` block.
