Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles null or empty matrices.
* **Clearer comments:** The comments explain the logic and purpose of the code more effectively.
* **Efficient binary search:** The binary search implementation is concise and avoids potential overflow issues when calculating `mid`.
* **Comprehensive `main` method:** The `main` method provides more test cases, including edge cases like an empty matrix and a single-element matrix,  demonstrating the robustness of the solution.
* **Adherence to prompt:** The code strictly adheres to the specified method signatures `void main(String[])` and `boolean searchMatrix(int[][], int)`.
