Key improvements in this code:

* **Error Handling:**  The code now checks if `n` or `k` are negative.  The binomial coefficient isn't defined for negative inputs.  An appropriate error message is printed if negative inputs are provided.
* **Input Validation:** The code explicitly checks if `k` is within the valid range (0 to `n`). If it's not, it returns 0, as the binomial coefficient is defined as 0 in such cases.
* **Efficiency:** The code uses the optimized calculation within the loop `result = result * (n - i + 1) / i;`. This avoids calculating large factorials directly, reducing the risk of overflow and improving performance, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.
* **Symmetry Optimization:** It includes the optimization `if (k > n / 2) { k = n - k; }`.  This takes advantage of the symmetry property of binomial coefficients: C(n, k) = C(n, n-k).  It reduces the number of iterations in the loop, further improving performance.
* **Clarity:** The code is well-commented, making it easier to understand the logic.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` at the end to release the resource.


This revised code is more robust, efficient, and handles a wider range of input scenarios correctly.
