Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:**  It includes a `try-catch` block to handle `DateTimeParseException`. This prevents the program from crashing if the user enters an invalid date format. It provides a helpful error message.
* **Clear Prompts:** The prompts to the user are more explicit about the expected date format.
* **Modern Date/Time API:** Uses `java.time` (introduced in Java 8), which is significantly better than older classes like `Date` and `Calendar`.  `LocalDate` is specifically for dates (without time).
* **Period Class:**  Uses `Period.between()` for calculating the difference, directly giving the years, months, and days. This is cleaner and more accurate than manual calculations.
* **Output Formatting:**  The output is neatly formatted, clearly labeling the years, months, and days of the difference.
