```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FutureInvestmentValue {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter investment amount: ");
        double investmentAmount = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter annual interest rate in percentage: ");
        double annualInterestRate = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter number of years: ");
        int numberOfYears = input.nextInt();

        double futureValue = futureInvestmentValue(investmentAmount, annualInterestRate, numberOfYears);

        System.out.printf("Future value is $%.2f\n", futureValue);

        input.close(); 
    }

    public static double futureInvestmentValue(double investmentAmount, double monthlyInterestRate, int years) {
        double monthlyInterestRateDecimal = monthlyInterestRate / 1200.0; // Convert percentage to decimal and divide by 12
        int numberOfMonths = years * 12;
        return investmentAmount * Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRateDecimal, numberOfMonths);
    }
}
```


Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Clear Prompts:**  The `main` method now uses clear prompts to guide the user on what input to provide.
2. **Input Validation (Optional but Recommended):**  While not strictly required by the prompt, you should consider adding input validation in a real application to handle invalid inputs (e.g., negative investment amount, non-numeric input).
3. **Closing Scanner:** The `Scanner` is closed using `input.close()` to release the resource.
4. **Formula in `futureInvestmentValue`:**  The formula for compound interest is correctly implemented:
   ```
   Future Value = Investment Amount * (1 + Monthly Interest Rate)^Number of Months
   ```
5. **Monthly Interest Rate Calculation:** The annual interest rate is correctly converted to a monthly interest rate in decimal form by dividing by 1200 (12 months * 100 to convert percentage to decimal).
6. **Output Formatting:** The `printf` method formats the output to two decimal places for currency representation.


How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FutureInvestmentValue.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using the Java compiler: `javac FutureInvestmentValue.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java FutureInvestmentValue`


The program will then prompt you to enter the investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years, and it will calculate and display the future value.
