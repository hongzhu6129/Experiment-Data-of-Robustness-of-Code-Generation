   This version uses `BigInteger`'s `pow()` and `add()` methods to perform calculations without overflow, allowing you to accurately represent all the first ten Fermat numbers.


3. **Clear Output:** The code now includes a descriptive message to indicate what's being printed.

4. **Simplified Calculation:** While `(long) (Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, n)) + 1)` works for the initial numbers, the `BigInteger` version is more consistent and avoids potential issues with floating-point precision when using `Math.pow()` for larger values of `n`.  The `BigInteger` approach is generally the preferred way to calculate large Fermat numbers.
