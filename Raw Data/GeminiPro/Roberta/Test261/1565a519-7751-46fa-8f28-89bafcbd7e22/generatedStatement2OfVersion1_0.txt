Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Includes specific checks for empty arrays and single-element arrays.
* **Clearer output:** Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange()` in `main` to print only the relevant part of the modified array (up to the `k`th element), avoiding printing the unchanged trailing elements.  This makes the output easier to understand and consistent with the problem description.
* **More test cases in `main`:**  Added more test cases to demonstrate the handling of various scenarios (empty array, single element, already unique array).
* **Conciseness:**  The code is still concise and efficient.


This revised answer directly addresses the prompt by providing a complete and robust solution within the constraints of the specified method signatures.
