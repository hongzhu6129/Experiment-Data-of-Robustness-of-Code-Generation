Key improvements:

* **Clearer Variable Names:** `min_idx` is more descriptive than just `min`.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method includes various test cases (empty array, single-element array, duplicates, already sorted, reverse sorted) to demonstrate the robustness of the `sort` method.
* **Output Formatting:** Using `Arrays.toString()` provides a clean and readable output of the sorted arrays.
* **Adherence to Prompt:**  The code strictly uses only the specified method signatures `public static void sort(int[])` and `public static void main(String[])`.



This improved version provides a more complete and demonstrably correct implementation of Selection Sort.  The additional test cases in `main` help verify that the algorithm works as expected in different scenarios.
