Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `lowerIndex` and `higherIndex` instead of `i` and `j` outside the inner loop makes the code's purpose more obvious.
* **Explanatory Comments:**  The comments now better explain the partitioning logic and recursive calls.
* **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `QuickSortEducational` class, including printing the unsorted and sorted arrays.
* **Handling Empty/Null Input:** The `sort` method now gracefully handles empty or null input arrays.
* **Consistent Parameter Order:** The `array` parameter is now consistently placed at the end in the `quickSort` and `exchangeNumbers` methods.


This revised version offers a more educational and practical implementation of Quick Sort. It's easier to understand and demonstrates good coding practices.
