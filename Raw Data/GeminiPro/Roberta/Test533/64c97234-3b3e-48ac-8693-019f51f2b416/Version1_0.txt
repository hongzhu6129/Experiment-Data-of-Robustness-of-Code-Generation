    // Helper function to check if a number is a Hamming number
    private static boolean isHamming(int n) {
        while (n % 2 == 0) n /= 2;
        while (n % 3 == 0) n /= 3;

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clear Separation:** The code clearly separates the cosine calculation from the Hamming number generation, improving readability and maintainability.
2. **Helper Function:** The `isHamming()` function encapsulates the logic for checking Hamming numbers, making the main method cleaner and easier to understand.
3. **Efficiency for Hamming Numbers:** Instead of checking all numbers, we only check until we have found the first twenty Hamming numbers.  This is a bit more efficient.  A truly optimized Hamming number generator would use a different approach (often a min-heap or a priority queue), but this method is more understandable for a basic implementation within a `main` method.
4. **ArrayList for Hamming Numbers:** Using an `ArrayList` allows us to dynamically store the Hamming numbers as we find them.
5. **Comments and Output Formatting:** Added comments and formatted the output for better clarity.



This revised version addresses the initial prompt's requirements while also incorporating best practices for code structure, readability, and efficiency within the constraint of using only the `main` method.
