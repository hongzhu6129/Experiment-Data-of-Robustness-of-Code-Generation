Explanation:

1. **`move_zero(int[] arr)`:**
   - Initializes a `j` pointer to track the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.
   - Iterates through the array using `i`.
   - If `arr[i]` is not zero, it swaps `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` using the `swap` method. This effectively moves the non-zero element to the left.
   - Increments `j` to prepare for the next non-zero element.

2. **`swap(int[] arr, int i, int j)`:**
   - A simple utility function to swap two elements in the array.

3. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - Creates a sample array.
   - Calls `move_zero` to rearrange the array.
   - Prints the modified array.


Key Improvement: This version avoids unnecessary swaps by only swapping when a non-zero element is encountered.  It's more efficient than repeatedly shifting elements.
