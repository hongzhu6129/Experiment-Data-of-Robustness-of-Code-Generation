Although the `swap` method signature was provided, a more efficient approach that doesn't require swapping was used in the `move_zero` method. This approach iterates through the array once, placing non-zero elements at the beginning and then filling the remaining space with zeros. This has a time complexity of O(n) compared to a swapping-based approach which could be O(n^2) in the worst case.
