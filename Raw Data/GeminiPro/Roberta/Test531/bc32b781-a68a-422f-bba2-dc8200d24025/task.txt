Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program to print the first 15 numbers of the Pell series. In mathematics, the Pell numbers are an infinite sequence of integers. The sequence of Pell numbers starts with 0 and 1, and then each Pell number is the sum of twice the previous Pell number and the Pell number before that.: thus, 70 is the companion to 29, and 70 = 2 × 29 + 12 = 58 + 12. The first few terms of the sequence are : 0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, 985, 2378, 5741, 13860,…\nExpected Output\n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n Problem Id is : bc32b781-a68a-422f-bba2-dc8200d24025.\n
