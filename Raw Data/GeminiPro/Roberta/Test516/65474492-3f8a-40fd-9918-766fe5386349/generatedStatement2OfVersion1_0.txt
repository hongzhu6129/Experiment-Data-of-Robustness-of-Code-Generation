Key improvements and explanations:

1. **HashSet for Cycle Detection:** The `isHappy_number` method now uses a `HashSet` called `seen` to keep track of numbers encountered during the process. This efficiently detects cycles. If a number is already in `seen`, it indicates a cycle, and the number is not happy.

2. **Clearer Loop Condition:** The `while` loop condition is more concise: `n != 1 && !seen.contains(n)`. It continues as long as the number isn't 1 and hasn't been seen before.

3. **Helper Function:** The `sumOfSquaresOfDigits` function is extracted to improve code readability and organization. It calculates the sum of squares of digits for a given number.

4. **Return Boolean Directly:** The `isHappy_number` method directly returns `n == 1` after the loop, making the logic clearer.

5. **Main Method with Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `isHappy_number` function with example numbers, including the ones from your prompt, and prints clear output.


This revised code is more efficient, readable, and adheres to best practices for happy number checking.
