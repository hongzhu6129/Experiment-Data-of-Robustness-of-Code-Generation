        // Test cases from the prompt's example (though not explicitly required to print these)

Explanation and improvements:

1. **HashSet for Cycle Detection:** The `isHappy_number` method now uses a `HashSet` called `seen` to keep track of numbers encountered during the process. This efficiently detects cycles, preventing infinite loops for unhappy numbers.

2. **Clearer Loop Condition:** The `while` loop condition is now `n != 1 && !seen.contains(n)`, combining the two essential checks for termination: reaching 1 (happy) or entering a cycle (unhappy).

3. **Simplified Sum Calculation:** The digit extraction and sum calculation within the loop remain concise and efficient.

4. **Return True/False:** The method correctly returns `true` if the number is happy (eventually reaches 1) and `false` otherwise (enters a cycle).

5. **Informative Main Method:** The `main` method demonstrates the usage of `isHappy_number` with example inputs and prints the results clearly.  I've also added the example test cases from the prompt, although printing them isn't strictly required by the prompt itself.


This improved version addresses the potential infinite loop issue, enhances clarity, and provides a more robust and correct solution to the happy number problem.
