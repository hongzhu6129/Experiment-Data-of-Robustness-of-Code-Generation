Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:**  It checks if the file exists and handles `IOExceptions` gracefully.
* **Command-line Argument:** The file path is taken as a command-line argument, making it more flexible.
* **Clearer Output:**  The output is formatted nicely and distinguishes between the two methods used.
* **java.nio.file.Files:** Demonstrates the preferred modern approach using `java.nio.file.Files`, which provides more file attributes and better precision (nanoseconds).
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the code.
