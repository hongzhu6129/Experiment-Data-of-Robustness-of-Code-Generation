This code demonstrates three common methods for swapping variables:

1. **Using a temporary variable:** This is the most straightforward and generally applicable method.  It works for all data types.

2. **Using addition and subtraction:** This method is efficient for numeric types but can lead to overflow issues if the sum of the two numbers exceeds the maximum value for the data type.

3. **Using bitwise XOR:** This method is also efficient for numeric types and avoids overflow issues.  However, it's slightly less intuitive.


The code also includes an example with Strings to demonstrate *why* a temporary variable is often necessary and what happens if you try to swap without one. The comments explain the incorrect and correct approaches for string swapping.
