Key improvements:

1. **Clearer Explanation:** Added comments to explain each step, especially the parsing and swapping of coefficients.
2. **Error Handling:** Included a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors if the equation is not in the expected format.  This makes the code more robust.
3. **Example of Coefficient Swapping:**  Added a more complex example to demonstrate how to parse an equation, extract coefficients, swap them, and reconstruct the modified equation.
4. **Trimmed Whitespace:**  Used `trim()` to remove extra spaces for more reliable parsing.
5. **Regular Expression for Coefficient Extraction:**  Used a regular expression `replaceAll("[^\\d-]", "")` to extract the numerical coefficients (including potential negative signs) more robustly.
