**Test Cases:**

| Input (n) | Expected Output | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| 12345 | 15 | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 |
| 0 | 0 | Sum of digits of 0 is 0 |
| -123 | 6 |  Handles negative numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 |
| 9 | 9 | Single digit number |
| 100 | 1 | Leading zeros don't affect the sum |
| 9999 | 36 | Large number test |
| Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647) | 46 |  Maximum integer value test |
| Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) | 47 | Minimum integer value test (absolute value used) |



**Explanation of the code and improvements:**

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The code now uses `Math.abs(n)` to handle negative input correctly.  The sum of digits should be the same regardless of the sign.

2. **Clear Function Name:**  The function is named `function` as requested by the prompt.  However, in real-world code, it's better to use more descriptive names like `sumOfDigits` to improve readability.

3. **Input Validation (Optional):** While not strictly required by the prompt, for a more robust program, you might want to add input validation within `main` to ensure the user enters a valid integer.

4. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` to release the resource.


**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. **Manually:** Enter each input value when prompted and verify the output matches the expected value.

2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):** Use a testing framework like JUnit to write automated tests.  This is the preferred approach for larger projects.  Here's a simple example using JUnit:
