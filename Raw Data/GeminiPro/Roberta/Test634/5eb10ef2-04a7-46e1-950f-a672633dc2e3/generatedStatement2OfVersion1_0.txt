Explanation:

1. **Create a PriorityQueue:**
   - `PriorityQueue<Integer> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();` creates a new `PriorityQueue` to store integers.  You can change `Integer` to any other data type as needed (e.g., `String`, custom objects, etc.).

2. **Add elements:**
   - `priorityQueue.add()` is used to add elements to the queue.  Remember that a `PriorityQueue` keeps elements sorted according to their natural ordering (or a custom `Comparator` if provided).

3. **`clear()` method:**
   - `priorityQueue.clear();` is the primary method for removing all elements from a `PriorityQueue`. It efficiently empties the queue.

4. **Re-initialization (alternative):**
   -  `priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();`  This creates a brand new, empty `PriorityQueue` and assigns it to the `priorityQueue` variable.  The original `PriorityQueue` object becomes eligible for garbage collection. This effectively clears the queue as well.

5. **Printing for demonstration:**
   - `System.out.println()` is used to show the contents of the `PriorityQueue` at different stages, demonstrating that the `clear()` method (or re-initialization) has successfully removed all elements.
