Explanation:

1. **`tenExceedsTwenty(int[] arr)` Method:**
   - Takes an integer array `arr` as input.
   - Initializes a `count` variable to 0.
   - Iterates through the array using an enhanced `for` loop (for-each loop).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `num` is equal to 10. If it is, the `count` is incremented.
   - Finally, it returns `true` if the `count` is greater than 20 (meaning the number 10 appears more than 20 times), and `false` otherwise.

2. **`main(String[] args)` Method:**
   - Creates example arrays (`arr1`, `arr2`, `arr3`, `arr4`).
   - Calls the `tenExceedsTwenty()` method with each array and prints the result to the console.  This demonstrates how to use the method and interpret the boolean output.


This code efficiently determines if the number 10 occurs more than 20 times within a given integer array.  The use of a separate method makes the code more organized and reusable.
