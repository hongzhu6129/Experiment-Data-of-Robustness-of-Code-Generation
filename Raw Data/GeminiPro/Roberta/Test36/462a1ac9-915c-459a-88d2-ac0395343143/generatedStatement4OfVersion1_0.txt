**How to manually verify (without a testing framework):**

1. **Run the Java code.**
2. **Visually inspect the output in your console/terminal.**  Carefully compare it to the expected output to confirm that the text, indentation, and newlines are all correct.



By following these testing strategies, you can ensure that the `printFormattedTwinkle()` function produces the desired output correctly.  Using a testing framework (like JUnit) would automate these comparisons and make the testing process more robust and efficient, especially as the code becomes more complex.
