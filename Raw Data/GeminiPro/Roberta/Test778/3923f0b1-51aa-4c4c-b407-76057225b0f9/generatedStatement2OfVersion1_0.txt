Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct "pct" placement:**  The "pct" is now correctly placed on the 7th row as specified in the original prompt.
* **Consistent Spacing and Alignment:**  Double equals signs (`==`) are used consistently before the long lines of equals, ensuring alignment matches the original output example.
* **Clearer Loop Structure:** The loops are structured more clearly, separating the logic for the starred section, the special row, and the striped section.
* **Correct Number of Stars and Stripes:**  The code prints the correct number of rows for both sections of the flag.



This revised code accurately produces the desired output as described in the prompt, including the "pct" on the 7th line and the correct alignment throughout.
