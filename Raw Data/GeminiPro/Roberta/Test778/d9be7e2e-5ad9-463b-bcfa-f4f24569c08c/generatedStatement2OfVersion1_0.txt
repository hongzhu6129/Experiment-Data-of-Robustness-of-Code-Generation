Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct Star Pattern:**  Accurately alternates rows of 6 and 5 stars.
* **"pct" Placement:** Includes the "pct" centered appropriately.
* **Clearer Structure:**  Uses more descriptive variable names and comments.
* **Consistent Spacing:** Maintains consistent spacing between elements.
* **Correct Number of Stripes:**  Prints the correct number of red and white stripes.


This revised code provides a much more accurate and visually appealing representation of the American flag within the constraints of the `public static void main` method.  The output closely matches the requested format.
