    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Input the latitude of coordinate 1: ");
        double lat1 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());  // Convert to radians

        System.out.print("Input the longitude of coordinate 1: ");
        double lon1 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble()); // Convert to radians

        System.out.print("Input the latitude of coordinate 2: ");

        double earthRadius = 6371.01; // Earth's radius in kilometers

        double distance = earthRadius * Math.acos(Math.sin(lat1) * Math.sin(lat2) +
                Math.cos(lat1) * Math.cos(lat2) * Math.cos(lon1 - lon2));

**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Output: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Coordinates:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -70
   - Expected Output: 0 km

3. **Opposite Sides of the Earth (Antipodes):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 110 
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's diameter)

4. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0   (Longitude irrelevant at poles)
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0   (Longitude irrelevant at poles)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's diameter)


5. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 90
   - Expected Output: ~10007.54 km  (approximately 1/4 Earth's circumference)

6. **One point at the North Pole:**
   - lat1: 90
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 45
   - lon2: 45
   - Expected Output: ~6371.01 km (approximately Earth's radius)


7. **Invalid Input (Boundary Cases):**
   - lat1: -91  (Invalid latitude) - Your program should handle this gracefully, perhaps by throwing an exception or clamping the value.
   - lon1: 181 (Invalid longitude)



**How to Test:**

- **Manual Testing:** You can manually enter these values into your program and verify the output.
- **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  Create a set of JUnit tests (or use another testing framework) where you call your distance calculation function with the test inputs and use `assertEquals()` to check if the calculated distance matches the expected distance within a reasonable tolerance (e.g., a difference of less than 0.001 km).


By testing these various scenarios, you can gain confidence that your Earth distance calculation function works correctly.  The automated testing approach is much more robust and efficient, especially as you make changes to your code over time.
