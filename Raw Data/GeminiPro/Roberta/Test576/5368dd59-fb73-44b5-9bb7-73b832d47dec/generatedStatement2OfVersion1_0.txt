This code demonstrates appending elements to a LinkedList in Java within the `main` method.  It covers:

1. **Creating a LinkedList:** Shows how to initialize a LinkedList of Strings and Integers.
2. **Appending with `add()`:**  The primary way to append � it adds the element to the end of the list.
3. **Appending with `addLast()`:** Demonstrates `addLast()`, which is functionally equivalent to `add()` in this context.
4. **Examples with different data types:** Includes examples with both String and Integer LinkedLists.
5. **Appending `null`:**  Shows that `null` can be a valid element in a LinkedList.


This comprehensive example within a single `main` method provides a clear and concise educational demonstration of how to append to a LinkedList in Java.
