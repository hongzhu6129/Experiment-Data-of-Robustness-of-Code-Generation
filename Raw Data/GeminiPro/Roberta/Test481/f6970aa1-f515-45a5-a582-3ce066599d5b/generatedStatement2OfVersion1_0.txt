Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Examples:** The `main` method now includes multiple examples demonstrating how to get the current zone offset, create a `ZonedDateTime` with a specific offset, and extract the offset from an `OffsetDateTime`.

2. **Robust Offset Formatting:** The `formatOffset` method handles both positive and negative offsets correctly and formats them consistently as "+HH:MM" or "-HH:MM".  This makes the output much more user-friendly.

3. **Use of `ZonedDateTime` and `OffsetDateTime`:**  These classes are the recommended way to work with time zones and offsets in modern Java. They provide a more robust and comprehensive API compared to older classes like `TimeZone` or `Calendar`.

4. **`java.time` Package:** The code uses the `java.time` package introduced in Java 8, which is the preferred way to handle date and time operations.


How to Compile and Run:

1. Save the code as `ZoneOffsetManipulation.java`.
2. Compile: `javac ZoneOffsetManipulation.java`
3. Run: `java ZoneOffsetManipulation`


This improved version provides clearer, more robust, and modern code for handling zone offsets in Java.
