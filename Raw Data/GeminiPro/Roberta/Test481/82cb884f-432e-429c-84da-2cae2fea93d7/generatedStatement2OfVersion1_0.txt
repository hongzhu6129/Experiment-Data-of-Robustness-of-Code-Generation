Key improvements in this code:

* **Error Handling:** Uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions (like invalid zone IDs).  This makes the code more robust.
* **Clearer Output:**  The output now clearly labels the zone and its offset.
* **Formatted Offset:** The `formatOffset` method ensures the offset is displayed in the standard  `+HH:MM` format, making it easier to read and understand. The plus sign is included for both positive and negative offsets.
* **Optional Full Listing:** The loop to iterate through all zones is now commented out.  This is usually unnecessary, but you can easily uncomment it if you want to see all offsets.
* **`ZonedDateTime` for accuracy:** Uses `ZonedDateTime` to get the current time in the specified zone, which ensures accurate offset calculations.
* **Uses `Math.abs`:** Ensures the minutes value in the formatted offset is always positive.


This revised version is more robust, provides clear output, handles errors, and conforms to standard offset formatting.
