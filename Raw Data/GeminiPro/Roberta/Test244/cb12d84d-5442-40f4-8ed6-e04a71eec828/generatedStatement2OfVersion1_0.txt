Key improvements and explanations in this revised version:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueIndex` is used instead of `j` to explicitly indicate its purpose, enhancing readability.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays and `null` input, returning 0 as expected.

3. **Illustrative `main` Method:** The `main` method demonstrates the usage of the `removeDuplicates` function with various test cases, including empty and null arrays. It also prints the updated array content for clarity.

4. **Concise and Efficient Logic:** The core logic remains efficient, using a single loop to iterate through the array and an `in-place` modification strategy.

5. **Correct Output:**  The code returns the correct new length of the array after removing duplicates.  It also prints the relevant portion of the modified array in the main method (using `Arrays.copyOfRange`) to demonstrate the change.  



This refined version is more robust, easier to understand, and provides better testing. It adheres to the given method signature requirements.
