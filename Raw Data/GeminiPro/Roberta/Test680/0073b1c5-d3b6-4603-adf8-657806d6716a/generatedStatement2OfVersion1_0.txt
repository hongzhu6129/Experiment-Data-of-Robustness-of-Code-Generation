Key improvements and explanations in this educational example:

1. **Clearer Explanation:** The code now includes more comments to guide the learner through each step.
2. **Two Methods:** Demonstrates both `Math.ceil()` and the integer arithmetic trick, highlighting the benefits and limitations of each.
3. **Emphasis on Casting:** Explicitly shows how to cast integers to doubles before using `Math.ceil()` to ensure accurate results.
4. **Multiple Examples:** Provides several examples with different numerators and denominators to reinforce the concepts.
5. **Caution about Negatives:**  Includes a critical warning about the integer arithmetic approach's unreliability with negative numbers and demonstrates why Math.ceil() is preferred in such scenarios.
6. **Incorrect Result Demonstration:**  Shows the learner exactly *why* and *how* integer arithmetic can fail with negative numbers, making the cautionary advice more impactful.
