**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes error handling for the case where the filename is not provided as a command-line argument or if the file is not found.

2. **Filtering Words Starting with a Letter:**  The `if (word.matches("[a-zA-Z].*"))` condition ensures that only words starting with a letter (a-z or A-Z) are added to the list.

3. **Descending Sort:** `Collections.sort(words, Collections.reverseOrder());` sorts the `words` ArrayList in descending alphabetical order.

4. **`display` Method:** The `display` method is used to print each word, adhering to the specified method signature requirement.

5. **`try-with-resources`:** The `Scanner` is used within a `try-with-resources` block to ensure that the file is closed properly even if an exception occurs.



**How to compile and run (from command line):**

1. Save the code as `DescendingWords.java`.
2. Compile: `javac DescendingWords.java`
3. Run: `java DescendingWords <your_text_file.txt>`  (Replace `<your_text_file.txt>` with the actual path to your text file).
