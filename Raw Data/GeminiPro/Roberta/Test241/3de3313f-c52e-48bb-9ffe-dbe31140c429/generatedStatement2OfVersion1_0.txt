**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays, returning 0 in both cases.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueCount` is more descriptive than `j` used in some other versions.

3. **In-Place Modification:** The algorithm modifies the original array `nums` in place, overwriting the duplicates with unique elements. This is a common and efficient approach for this type of problem.

4. **Returns Length:**  The function `removeDuplicates` returns the length of the updated array (the number of unique elements).

5. **Improved `main` Method:** The `main` method now includes more test cases (empty, null, and multiple duplicates) to demonstrate the robustness of the code.  It also uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` and prints only the relevant, updated part of the array, avoiding displaying the remaining "garbage" values after the unique elements.


This revised version is more concise, efficient, robust, and adheres to best coding practices. It effectively demonstrates how to remove duplicates from a sorted array in Java using only the specified method signatures.
