Key improvements and explanations:

1. **ListIterator for efficient insertion:** The `insertAtIndex` method now uses a `ListIterator` to insert elements.  `ListIterator` is much more efficient for insertions and deletions within a `LinkedList` compared to using `add(index, element)` directly, especially when dealing with larger lists.

2. **Clearer error handling:**  The `try-catch` block specifically catches `IndexOutOfBoundsException` and provides a more informative error message, telling the user the valid index range.

3. **Illustrative examples:**  The `main` method demonstrates insertion at different positions (beginning, middle, end) and also shows how invalid indices are handled. This makes the educational aspect clearer.

4. **Comments:**  Added more comments throughout the code to explain the purpose of different parts and how the insertion works.

5. **Inserting at the end:**  Added an example to demonstrate how to insert at the end of the list (which is equivalent to a regular `add()` operation).  This clarifies how the `insertAtIndex` method can handle this case as well.
