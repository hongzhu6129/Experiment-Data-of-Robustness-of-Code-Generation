        String str2 = " World";

        // Method 1: Using the + operator
        String concatenatedString1 = str1 + str2;
        System.out.println("Concatenated string (using +): " + concatenatedString1);

        // Method 2: Using the concat() method
        String concatenatedString2 = str1.concat(str2);
        System.out.println("Concatenated string (using concat()): " + concatenatedString2);


        // Example with user-provided strings (if you run from command line)

            String arg2 = args[1];
            String concatenatedArgs = arg1.concat(arg2);
            System.out.println("Concatenated command-line arguments: " + concatenatedArgs);
        } else if (args.length > 0) {
            System.out.println("Please provide exactly two strings as command-line arguments.");
        }

    }

This code demonstrates two primary ways to concatenate strings in Java:

1. **Using the `+` operator:** This is the simplest and most common method.

2. **Using the `concat()` method:**  This method is part of the `String` class and provides another way to achieve concatenation.  It's functionally equivalent to the `+` operator in most cases.

The code also includes an example of handling command-line arguments. If you run this Java program from the command line and provide two strings as arguments, it will concatenate them and print the result.  This is useful for making your program more flexible and allowing users to input the strings they want to concatenate.  If you provide more or fewer than two arguments, it gives a helpful message.


**To compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StringConcatenation.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac StringConcatenation.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code:  `java StringConcatenation`  (This will use the hardcoded "Hello" and " World"). Or provide arguments: `java StringConcatenation "First String" "Second String"`  (Replace with your desired strings).


This improved answer addresses efficiency (the `+` operator is generally optimized by the compiler for strings), clarity (comments explain each method), and provides a practical example of using command-line arguments, which is a common programming task.
