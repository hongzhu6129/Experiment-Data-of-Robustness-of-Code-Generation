**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles cases where the input array is `null` or empty, preventing potential `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. **Clearer Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` is used instead of `j` to make the purpose of the variable clearer.

3. **In-place Modification:** The solution correctly modifies the input array in-place, fulfilling the requirement of using O(1) extra memory.

4. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** The `main` method demonstrates the function's usage with multiple test cases, including edge cases like an empty array and a `null` array. This makes it easier to verify the correctness of the implementation.

5. **Correct Return Value:** The function returns the correct new length of the array after removing duplicates.

6. **Printing the modified array:** The `main` method now prints the modified array (up to the new length) using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to demonstrate the in-place changes clearly. This addresses previous ambiguity about whether the changes were reflected in the original array.



This improved version addresses the issues in the earlier responses and provides a more robust and clear solution to the problem.
