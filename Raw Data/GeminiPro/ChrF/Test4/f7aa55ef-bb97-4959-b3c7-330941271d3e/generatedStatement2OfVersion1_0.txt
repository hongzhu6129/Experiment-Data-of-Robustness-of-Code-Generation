**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner/edge cases:

1. **Standard Case (Given Radius):**
   - Input: 7.5
   - Expected Perimeter: 47.12
   - Expected Area: 176.71

2. **Zero Radius:**
   - Input: 0
   - Expected Perimeter: 0.00
   - Expected Area: 0.00

3. **Negative Radius (Invalid Input - Should handle gracefully):**
   - Input: -5
   - Expected Behavior:  An appropriate error message or exception handling to indicate that the radius cannot be negative. The program should not crash. You might print an error message like "Radius cannot be negative."  Or you could throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.

4. **Very Large Radius:**
   - Input: 100000
   - Expected Perimeter: 628318.53 (approximately)
   - Expected Area: 31415926535.89 (approximately)  (Test for potential overflow issues with very large numbers if not using `double`)


5. **Small Radius:**
   - Input: 0.001
   - Expected Perimeter: 0.01
   - Expected Area: 0.00
