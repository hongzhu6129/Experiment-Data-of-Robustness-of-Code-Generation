nullInput Sentence 1:  \nWrite a Java program to check if a given number is a circular prime or not. Circular Prime : A circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its (base 10) digits will be prime. For example, 1193 is a circular prime, since 1931, 9311 and 3119 all are also prime. A circular prime with at least two digits can only consist of combinations of the digits 1, 3, 7 or 9, because having 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 as the last digit makes the number divisible by 2, and having 0 or 5 as the last digit makes it divisible by 5. Input Data: Input a number: 35\nIt is not a Circular Prime number.\n\n\n Input Sentence 2: 1. notes a Java program to check if a given number is a circular prime or not. circular prime: a circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its (base 10) digits will be prime. for example, 1193 is a circular prime, since 1931, 9311 and 3119 all are also prime. a circular prime with at least two digits can only consist of combinations of the digits 1, 3, 7 or 9, because having 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 as the last digit makes the number divisible by 2, and having 0 or 5 as the last digit makes it divisible by 5. input data: input a number: 35it is not a circular prime number.Cosine Similarity: 0.9992Euclidean Distance: 0.2295
