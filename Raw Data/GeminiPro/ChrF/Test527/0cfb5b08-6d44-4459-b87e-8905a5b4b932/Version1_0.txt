```java
public class Ramanujan {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1729; //  The Hardy-Ramanujan number

        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            int a3 = a * a * a;
            if (a3 > n) {
                break; // Optimization: No need to check further if a^3 exceeds n
            }

            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) { // b starts from a+1 to avoid duplicate pairs (and ensure distinct pairs)
                int b3 = b * b * b;
                if (a3 + b3 > n) {
                    break; // Optimization: No need to check further if a^3 + b^3 exceeds n
                }
                
                for (int c = a + 1; c <= n; c++) { // Similar logic to the 'b' loop
                    int c3 = c * c * c;
                    if (c3 > n) {
                        break;
                    }
                    for (int d = c + 1; d <=n; d++){
                        int d3 = d * d * d;
                        if(c3 + d3 > n){
                            break;
                        }


                        if (a3 + b3 == c3 + d3) {
                            if (a3 + b3 <= n) { // Check one last time to make sure within range n 
                                System.out.println(a3 + b3 + " = " + a + "^3 + " + b + "^3 = " + c + "^3 + " + d + "^3");
                                return; // Exit after finding the first such number. Remove this line to find all numbers.
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Distinct Pairs:**  The inner loops start from `a+1` and `c+1` respectively to ensure that (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct pairs and also avoid duplicates (e.g., 1^3 + 12^3 and 12^3 + 1^3 would be considered the same without this change).

2. **Optimizations:** The `break` statements within the loops significantly improve efficiency.  They prevent unnecessary calculations when the sum of cubes already exceeds `n`.

3. **Clarity and Readability:** Comments have been added to make the code easier to understand.

4. **Correctness:** The code now accurately finds a number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two *different* ways, as per the problem specification.

5. **Flexibility:**  You can easily remove the `return;` statement if you want the program to print *all* such numbers between 1 and `n` instead of just the first one.


This revised code is more efficient, correct, and adheres more closely to the original intent of the Ramanujan number problem.
