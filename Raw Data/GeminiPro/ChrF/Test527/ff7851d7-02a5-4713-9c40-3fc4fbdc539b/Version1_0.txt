public class Ramanujan {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1729; //  Ramanujan's number (example)

        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            int a3 = a * a * a;
            if (a3 > n) {
                break; 
            }

            int count = 0;
            for (int b = 1; b < a; b++) {  // Avoid duplicates (a^3 + b^3 is same as b^3 + a^3)
                int b3 = b * b * b;
                if (a3 + b3 > n) {
                    break;
                }

                for (int c = 1; c <= n; c++) {
                    int c3 = c * c * c;
                    if (c3 > n) {
                        break;
                    }

                    for (int d = 1; d < c; d++) { // Avoid duplicates
                        int d3 = d * d * d;

                        if (c3 + d3 > n) {
                            break;
                        }

                        if (a3 + b3 == c3 + d3 && a != c && a != d && b != c && b!=d) {
                            if (count == 0) { // Print the number only the first time a match is found
                                System.out.println(a3 + b3 + " = " + a + "^3 + " + b + "^3 = " + c + "^3 + " + d + "^3");

                            }
                             count++; 
                        }
                    }

Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Efficiency:** The code now avoids redundant calculations by breaking out of loops when the sum of cubes exceeds `n`.  This significantly improves performance, especially for larger values of `n`.

2. **Duplicate Handling (Crucial):** The inner loops use `d < c` and `b < a`. This prevents checking the same combinations of cubes in a different order (e.g., a^3 + b^3 and b^3 + a^3) and efficiently handles duplicates. The additional condition `a != c && a != d && b != c && b!=d` ensures that it's a different way of expressing the sum.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output now prints the number only the first time it's found to be expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.  A `count` variable is used to keep track of multiple representations.

4. **Correctness:** The logic is now accurately finding numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two *different* sets of two cubes.

5. **Ramanujan's Number Example:** The code initializes `n` to 1729, the famous Ramanujan number, as an example. You can easily change this value to test with other ranges.



This revised version provides a much more efficient and correct solution to the Ramanujan number problem within the constraints of a single `main` method.
