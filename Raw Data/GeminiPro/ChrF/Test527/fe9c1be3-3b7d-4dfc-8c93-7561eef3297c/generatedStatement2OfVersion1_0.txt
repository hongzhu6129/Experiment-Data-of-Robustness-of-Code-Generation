Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Efficiency:**  It avoids redundant calculations and includes an optimization to break out of loops early when the sums exceed `n`.
* **Clarity:**  The code is better structured and easier to understand.  Comments explain the logic.
* **Correctness:** The code accurately finds the *first* number between 1 and `n` that meets the Ramanujan condition and then exits.  It also correctly handles duplicate pairs of cubes that sum to the same value.
* **Flexibility:** The value of `n` is easily adjustable.
* **Bounded Array:** The code uses a reasonably sized array to store sums to avoid potential out-of-bounds exceptions.


How it works:

1. **Outer loop (a):** Iterates from 1 up to `n` (or until `a^3` exceeds `n`).
2. **Inner loops (b, c, d):**  Generate combinations of cubes (`b^3`, `c^3`, `d^3`).
3. **Check for equality:**  Checks if `a^3 + b^3 == c^3 + d^3`.
4. **Duplicate Sum Check:** Ensures the same sum isn't printed multiple times due to different cube combinations.
5. **Count and Print:** Tracks the number of ways a sum is expressed as a sum of two cubes.  If a sum has two or more representations, it's printed, and the program terminates.


This version addresses the potential issues in the previous responses and provides a more robust and correct solution to the Ramanujan number problem.
