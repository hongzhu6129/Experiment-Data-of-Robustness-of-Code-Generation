        int n = 1729; //  Ramanujan's number is a well-known example. You can change this to search within a different range.

                break;  // Optimization: If a^3 is already larger than n, no need to continue.
            }

            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) { // b starts from a + 1 to avoid duplicate pairs (e.g., 1^3 + 2^3 is the same as 2^3 + 1^3).
                int b3 = b * b * b;
                int sum = a3 + b3;

                if (sum > n) {

                }

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Efficiency:** The code includes several optimizations to avoid unnecessary calculations:
   - The inner loop for `b` breaks if `sum` exceeds `n`.
   - The outer loop for `a` breaks if `a3` exceeds `n`.
   - Inside `isSumOfTwoCubes`, we calculate `d` using `Math.cbrt` (cube root) which is much more efficient than multiple loops.
   - The inner method returns as soon as it finds a second solution, rather than trying to find them all.

2. **Avoiding Duplicates:** The inner loop for `b` starts from `a + 1` to avoid duplicate pairs (e.g., 1� + 2� is the same as 2� + 1�). We only need to find one representation.

3. **Clarity:** The code is well-commented to explain the logic and optimizations.  Meaningful variable names are used.

4. **`isSumOfTwoCubes` function:** This helper function checks if a given number `sum` can be expressed as the sum of two cubes *other than* the given pair `a` and `b`.

5. **`Math.cbrt`:**  This is a more efficient way to calculate the cube root than using a nested loop.  The `Math.round` is used because `Math.cbrt` returns a `double`, and we need to convert it back to an `int` safely.



This improved version provides a more efficient and clearer solution to finding numbers expressible as the sum of two cubes in two or more different ways within a specified range.
