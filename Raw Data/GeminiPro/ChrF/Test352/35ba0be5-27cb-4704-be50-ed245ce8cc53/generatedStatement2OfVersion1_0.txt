**Explanation:**

1. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - This is the entry point of the program.  It calls `permutationWithRepeation` with the input string.

2. **`permutationWithRepeation(String str)`:**
   - This method initiates the recursive process by calling `showPermutation` with the input string and an empty prefix.

3. **`showPermutation(String str, String prefix)`:**
   - This is the recursive method that generates the permutations.
   - **Base Case:** If the length of the `prefix` equals the length of the original `str`, it means a full permutation has been formed.  The `prefix` (which is now a complete permutation) is printed, and the function returns.
   - **Recursive Step:** It iterates through each character of the input `str`. In each iteration, it adds the current character to the `prefix` and makes a recursive call to `showPermutation` with the same `str` and the updated `prefix`. This generates all possible combinations by exploring all character choices at each position.

**Example with "abc":**

1. `showPermutation("abc", "")`
2. Loop 1 (i=0): `showPermutation("abc", "a")`
3. Loop 1 (i=0): `showPermutation("abc", "aa")`
4. Loop 1 (i=0): `showPermutation("abc", "aaa")`  (Prints "aaa")
5. Loop 2 (i=1): `showPermutation("abc", "aab")`  (Prints "aab")
6. Loop 3 (i=2): `showPermutation("abc", "aac")`  (Prints "aac")
7. Loop 2 (i=1): `showPermutation("abc", "ab")`
8. ...and so on, until all permutations are generated and printed.



This revised version strictly adheres to the provided method signatures.  It effectively generates and prints all permutations with repetition.
