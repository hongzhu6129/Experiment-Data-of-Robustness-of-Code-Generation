```java
import java.util.Calendar;

public class MaxValuesFromDate {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();

        // Get the maximum values for year, month, week of year, and day of month.
        // Note: These values are NOT based on the *current* date, but rather 
        // the maximum possible values supported by the Calendar class. 
        // For fields like YEAR, it's a very large number; for MONTH, it's 11
        // (because months are 0-indexed); for WEEK_OF_YEAR and DAY_OF_MONTH, 
        // it depends on the calendar system and specific year/month.

        int maxYear = calendar.getMaximum(Calendar.YEAR);
        int maxMonth = calendar.getMaximum(Calendar.MONTH);  // 0-indexed (0 = January, 11 = December)
        int maxWeekOfYear = calendar.getMaximum(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR); 
        int maxDayOfMonth = calendar.getMaximum(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);

        System.out.println("Maximum Year: " + maxYear);
        System.out.println("Maximum Month (0-indexed): " + maxMonth);
        System.out.println("Maximum Week of Year: " + maxWeekOfYear);
        System.out.println("Maximum Day of Month: " + maxDayOfMonth);


        // To get the max day of the *current* month:
        int maxDayOfCurrentMonth = calendar.getActualMaximum(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);
        System.out.println("Maximum Day of the Current Month: " + maxDayOfCurrentMonth);


        //Example to get maximum week number of specific year (e.g., 2024 which is a leap year):
         calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2024);
         int maxWeekOfYear2024 = calendar.getActualMaximum(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR);
         System.out.println("Maximum Week of Year 2024: " + maxWeekOfYear2024);
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Important Notes:**

1. **`Calendar.getMaximum(field)`:**  This method returns the maximum value for the *given field* (e.g., YEAR, MONTH) supported by the `Calendar` class.  It does **not** give you the maximum value based on the current date.  For instance, `calendar.getMaximum(Calendar.YEAR)` will be a very large number, not the current year.

2. **`Calendar.getActualMaximum(field)`:** This method is essential when you want the maximum value *for the current date's context*. For example, `calendar.getActualMaximum(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH)` gives you the last day of the *current* month.

3. **Month Indexing:**  `Calendar` uses 0-indexed months (January = 0, February = 1, ..., December = 11). `calendar.getMaximum(Calendar.MONTH)` will always return 11.

4. **Week of Year:** The maximum week of the year can be 52, 53, or even 54 in rare cases, depending on the week numbering rules and the specific year (leap years can affect this).  Use `getActualMaximum(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR)` for the current year or set a specific year using `calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, year)` before calling `getActualMaximum`.

5. **Day of Month:** The maximum day of the month varies (28, 29, 30, or 31). Use `getActualMaximum(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH)` to get the correct value for the current month.


The improved code provides both `getMaximum()` (for the absolute maximums) and `getActualMaximum()` (for the context-specific maximums, which are likely what you need in most real-world scenarios).  It also includes an example demonstrating how to handle a specific year.
