**Explanation and Corrections:**

The original prompt had some errors in the formula (extra '+' where it should have been '-'). The correct Leibniz formula for approximating pi alternates adding and subtracting the reciprocals of odd numbers.  The code above implements this correctly. It calculates two approximations:

1. **`piApproximation1`**:  Up to 1/11
2. **`piApproximation2`**: Up to 1/13

It then prints both results.  The use of `1.0` instead of `1` ensures that floating-point division is performed, giving a more accurate approximation.
