```java
public class ApproximatePi {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Calculate the approximation of pi with 5 terms
        double piApproximation1 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0 / 3.0) + (1.0 / 5.0) - (1.0 / 7.0) + (1.0 / 9.0) - (1.0 / 11.0) );

        // Calculate the approximation of pi with 6 terms
        double piApproximation2 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0 / 3.0) + (1.0 / 5.0) - (1.0 / 7.0) + (1.0 / 9.0) - (1.0 / 11.0) + (1.0/13.0));


        System.out.println("Approximation with 5 terms (up to 1/11): " + piApproximation1);
        System.out.println("Approximation with 6 terms (up to 1/13): " + piApproximation2);
    }
}
```


Key improvements in this code:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is now more concise and easier to understand. The calculations are separated clearly, and comments explain each step.
* **Corrected Formula:** The formula is now correctly implemented, alternating signs and using the correct denominators (3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13...).
* **Double Precision:**  Using `1.0` (or `4.0`) ensures double-precision arithmetic, which is necessary for accurate floating-point calculations.
* **Output:** The results are clearly labeled in the output, making it easy to interpret the approximations.


This revised code directly addresses the prompt's requirements and produces the correct approximations for pi using the given formula.
