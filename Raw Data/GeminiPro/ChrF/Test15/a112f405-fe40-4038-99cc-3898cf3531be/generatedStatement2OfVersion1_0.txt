**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Decimal Input | Expected Hexadecimal Output |
|---|---|
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 10 | A |
| 15 | F |
| 16 | 10 |
| 255 | FF |
| 1024 | 400 |
| -1 |  (Handle this case appropriately.  Either throw an exception or define behavior for negative numbers) |  
| Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647) | 7FFFFFFF |
| Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) | (Handle this case - it may produce 80000000 if using two's complement representation, but the function might need adjustments). |


**How to run the tests:**

1. **Manual Testing:** You can manually enter these values into the program's prompt and verify the output.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):** A more robust approach is to use JUnit (or a similar testing framework) to create automated tests. This is how professional Java development is done.
