public class SecondsSince1970 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the current time as an Instant object
        Instant now = Instant.now();

        // Get the number of seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)
        long secondsSinceEpoch = now.getEpochSecond();

        // Print the result
        System.out.println("Seconds since 1970: " + secondsSinceEpoch);


        // Alternate method using System.currentTimeMillis():
        long millisecondsSinceEpoch = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long secondsSinceEpochAlt = millisecondsSinceEpoch / 1000;  // Convert milliseconds to seconds

        System.out.println("Seconds since 1970 (alternate method): " + secondsSinceEpochAlt);
    }
}
```


Explanation using `Instant`:

1. **`Instant.now()`:** This gets the current time as an `Instant` object, which represents a point in time on the timeline.

2. **`now.getEpochSecond()`:**  This method extracts the number of whole seconds that have elapsed since the "epoch," which is defined as January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

Explanation using `System.currentTimeMillis()` (Alternate Method):

1. **`System.currentTimeMillis()`:** This returns the current time in milliseconds since the epoch.
2. **`millisecondsSinceEpoch / 1000`:**  We divide the result by 1000 to convert milliseconds to seconds.  This method is slightly less precise than using `Instant.getEpochSecond()` because it truncates any fractional seconds.


Both methods achieve the same fundamental goal of calculating seconds since the epoch, but the `Instant` approach is generally preferred for its clarity and accuracy when dealing with time-related operations.
