```java
public class DivideTwoNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 50;
        int num2 = 3;

        int result = num1 / num2;

        System.out.println(result); // Output: 16 (integer division)


        // For a more precise result (including decimals), use floating-point division:
        double num3 = 50.0;
        double num4 = 3.0;

        double result2 = num3 / num4;

        System.out.println(result2); // Output: 16.666666666666668

        //  Handling potential division by zero:
         int a = 50;
         int b = 0; // Example of a divisor that could be zero

        if (b != 0) {
            int result3 = a / b;
            System.out.println(result3);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Division by zero is not allowed.");
        }




        // Taking inputs from command-line arguments:

        if (args.length == 2) {  // Check if two arguments are provided
            try {
                double arg1 = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);
                double arg2 = Double.parseDouble(args[1]);

                if (arg2 != 0) {
                    double result4 = arg1 / arg2;
                    System.out.println(result4);
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Division by zero is not allowed.");
                }
            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                System.out.println("Invalid input. Please provide numbers as arguments.");
            }

        } else {
            System.out.println("Please provide two numbers as command-line arguments.");
        }


    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Integer vs. Floating-Point Division:** The original code performs integer division, discarding the remainder. I've added an example of floating-point division using `double` to get a more precise result if needed.

2. **Handling Division by Zero:**  The code now includes error handling to prevent division by zero, which would cause an `ArithmeticException`. This is crucial for robust code.

3. **Command-Line Arguments:** I've added the capability to accept the two numbers as command-line arguments.  This makes the program more flexible and reusable. The code includes error handling to check if the correct number of arguments is provided and if the arguments are valid numbers.

4. **Clearer Comments:** I've added more comments to explain each section of the code, making it easier to understand.

5. **Try-Catch Block:** The code now includes a try-catch block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters non-numeric input as command-line arguments.  This prevents the program from crashing.


**How to compile and run with command-line arguments:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DivideTwoNumbers.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:  `javac DivideTwoNumbers.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with arguments like this: `java DivideTwoNumbers 100 4` (This will divide 100 by 4).  Replace 100 and 4 with any numbers you want to divide.



This improved version addresses potential issues, handles user input gracefully, and provides more flexibility in how you can use the program.
