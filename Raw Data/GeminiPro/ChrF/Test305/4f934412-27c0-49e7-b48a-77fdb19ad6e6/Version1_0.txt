**Test cases including corner cases:**

* **Empty strings:**
    * Input: "", ""
    * Expected output: "The two strings are equal."
* **Strings with different lengths:**
    * Input: "hello", "helloworld"
    * Expected output: "The first string is less than the second string."
* **Strings with the same length but different characters:**
    * Input: "apple", "banana"
    * Expected output: "The first string is less than the second string."
* **Strings with the same characters but in different order:**
    * Input: "abc", "cba"
    * Expected output: "The first string is less than the second string."
* **Strings with special characters:**
    * Input: "This is a string with special characters!", "This is another string with special characters!"
    * Expected output: "The first string is less than the second string."
* **Strings with mixed case:**
    * Input: "Hello", "hello"
    * Expected output: "The first string is greater than the second string."
