Explanation:

1. **`removeElement(int[] nums, int val)` method:**
   - Takes the integer array `nums` and the value to remove `val` as input.
   - Initializes `k` to 0. `k` will keep track of the index where the next non-`val` element should be placed.
   - Iterates through the `nums` array.
   - If the current element `nums[i]` is not equal to `val`, it's copied to the `k`-th position, and `k` is incremented.
   - Finally, `k` (the new length) is returned.

2. **`main(String[] args)` method:**
   - Creates a sample array `nums`.
   - Sets the value to remove `val`.
   - Prints the original array.
   - Calls `removeElement` to get the new length and prints it.
   - (Optional) Prints the updated array using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to create a new array containing only the first `newLength` elements of the original array (this helps to visualize the result, even though the problem statement only asks to return the length).



Important Note:  The original array `nums` is modified in-place. The elements after the `k`-th position are still present but are now considered irrelevant.  That's why the optional printing of the updated array uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to create a new, properly sized array.
