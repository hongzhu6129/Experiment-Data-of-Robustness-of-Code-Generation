```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadPlainTextFile {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Specify the path to your text file
        String filePath = "path/to/your/file.txt"; // Replace with the actual path

        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation and How to Use:**

1. **Replace `path/to/your/file.txt`:**  Change this placeholder to the *actual* path of the text file you want to read on your system.  For example:
   -  `"C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\my_text_file.txt"` (Windows)
   -  `/home/yourname/documents/my_text_file.txt` (Linux/macOS)
2. **Compile and Run:** Compile the Java code (e.g., `javac ReadPlainTextFile.java`) and then run it (e.g., `java ReadPlainTextFile`).
3. **Output:** The program will print the contents of the text file to the console, line by line.
4. **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles potential `IOExceptions` that can occur if the file is not found or if there are other problems accessing it.  It prints an error message if an exception occurs.
5. **Try-with-resources:** The `try (BufferedReader reader = ...)` syntax ensures that the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed even if an exception is thrown, preventing resource leaks.


**Example `file.txt` Content:**

```
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
And this is the third.
```

**Output when you run the program (assuming the correct path is provided):**

```
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
And this is the third.
```
