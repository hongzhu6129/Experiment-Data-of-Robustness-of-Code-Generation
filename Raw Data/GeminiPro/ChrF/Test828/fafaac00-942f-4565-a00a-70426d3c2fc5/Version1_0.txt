```java
public class MultiplicationTable {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length == 0) {
            System.out.println("Please provide a number as input.");
            return;
        }

        try {
            int num = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

            for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                System.out.println(num + " x " + i + " = " + (num * i));
            }
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation and How to Run:**

1. **Input:** The program takes the number as a command-line argument.  This means you provide the number when you run the program from your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Error Handling:** The code includes a `try-catch` block.  This is essential for robust code.  It attempts to convert the input string (from `args[0]`) to an integer. If the user enters something that's not a number (like "abc"), the `NumberFormatException` is caught, and an error message is printed.

3. **Multiplication Table Logic:** The `for` loop iterates from 1 to 10. Inside the loop:
   - It calculates the product of the input number (`num`) and the loop counter (`i`).
   - It prints the multiplication table entry in the desired format (e.g., "8 x 1 = 8").

**To compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `MultiplicationTable.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:
   ```bash
   javac MultiplicationTable.java 
   ```
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with the desired number as input:
   ```bash
   java MultiplicationTable 8  // This will print the table for 8
   java MultiplicationTable 15 // This will print the table for 15
   ```


If you are using an IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans), you can usually run the program directly from the IDE by providing the command-line arguments in the run configuration settings.  Look for a section related to "Program arguments" or "Run configurations."
