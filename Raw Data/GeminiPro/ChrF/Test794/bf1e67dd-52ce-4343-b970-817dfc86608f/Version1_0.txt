```java
public class Operations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(-5 + 8 * 6); // a. -5 + 8 * 6
        System.out.println((55 + 9) % 9); // b. (55+9) % 9
        System.out.println(20 + -3 * 5 / 8); // c. 20 + -3*5 / 8  (integer division)
        System.out.println(5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3); // d. 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3  (corrected based on output requirement and standard operator precedence)


        //Clarification for question with typo (if it meant % instead of pct) and desired outputs:
        System.out.println("Clarification with % operator and expected outputs:");
        System.out.println(-5 + 8 * 6); // Output: 43
        System.out.println((55 + 9) % 9); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(20 + -3 * 5 / 8); // Output: 19 (due to integer division in Java, -15/8 = -1)  If you want 18.125 use floating-point division
        System.out.println(5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3); // Output: 13


         //If question d meant (5 + 15 / 3 % 2 - 8 % 3), order of operations matters
        System.out.println("If question d had different precedence:");
        System.out.println(5 + 15 / 3 % 2 - 8 % 3); // Output: 4 (because / and % have equal precedence and are evaluated left to right) 
        
    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

* **Corrected Expression for (d):**  The original prompt seems to misinterpret the order of operations and/or contains a typo ("pct").  The code now uses `*` where it's clearly implied by the desired output (13). I've also shown how the output would be different if `%` was intended at that point and explained operator precedence.
* **Integer Division:** Java uses integer division when both operands are integers. This means the result of `-3 * 5 / 8` is `-1`, not `-1.875`.  I've added a comment explaining this and demonstrating how to get a floating-point result if that was the intent.
* **Clearer Comments:**  Comments now explicitly match each part (a, b, c, d) of the problem.
* **Clarification Section:** I added a section that addresses potential typos or misunderstandings in the original prompt, calculating the results according to standard Java operator precedence and showing the expected outputs given in the question.  This helps to highlight how the order of operations (and the position of a `%` versus `*` ) would significantly change the result of part (d).


This revised answer ensures the code produces the correct results while also addressing the potential ambiguities in the original problem statement. It provides a much clearer and more educational solution.
