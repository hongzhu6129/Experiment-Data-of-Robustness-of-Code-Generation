**Explanation:**

1. **Create a LinkedList:** We initialize a `LinkedList` of strings.  You can change the type to any other object type you need.
2. **Add Elements:** We add some sample elements to the list.
3. **Check for Empty List:**  We check if the list is empty using `isEmpty()`. It's important to do this before trying to retrieve an element, to avoid exceptions.
4. **Retrieve the First Element (without removing):** 
   - We use the `peek()` method. `peek()` returns the first element (head) of the list *without* removing it.  If the list is empty, `peek()` will return `null`.
   - Alternatively, you can use `getFirst()`.  `getFirst()` does the same thing as `peek()`, but will throw a `NoSuchElementException` if the list is empty.
5. **Print the Element and the List:** We print the retrieved element and the entire linked list. This demonstrates that the first element is still present in the list after the retrieval operation, confirming that `peek()` (or `getFirst()`) does not modify the list.


**Key Differences between `peek()` and `getFirst()`:**

- `peek()` returns `null` if the list is empty.
- `getFirst()` throws a `NoSuchElementException` if the list is empty.

In most cases, `peek()` is safer to use because it avoids potential exceptions.  However, if you want the code to explicitly fail with an exception if the list is empty, `getFirst()` would be the better choice.
