Explanation of the code and patterns:

* **`java.time` Package:** The modern Java date and time API (introduced in Java 8) is used for handling dates and times effectively.
* **`LocalDateTime`:** Represents a date and time without a time zone.
* **`ZonedDateTime`:** Represents a date and time with a time zone.  Crucial for formats that include time zones.
* **`DateTimeFormatter`:** Used to format dates and times according to specified patterns.
* **Patterns:**
    * `yyyy`: Year (4 digits)
    * `MM`: Month (2 digits)
    * `dd`: Day of month (2 digits)
    * `HH`: Hour (0-23)
    * `mm`: Minute
    * `ss`: Second
    * `SSS`: Milliseconds
    * `E`: Day of week (short, e.g., "Mon")
    * `MMM`: Month (short, e.g., "Jan")
    * `Z`: Time zone (full, e.g., "+01:00")
    * `z`: Time zone (short, e.g., "GMT")


Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is formatted and commented for better understanding.
* **Correct Time Zone Handling:**  `ZonedDateTime` is used where time zone information is required in the format.
* **Millisecond and Zone:** The `SSSZ` pattern correctly outputs milliseconds and the time zone.
* **All requested formats implemented:** The code now accurately produces output in all the formats you requested.


This improved answer addresses the requirements of the question while providing a more robust and understandable solution.
