Key Improvements and Explanations:

* **Handles Negative Numbers Correctly:**  Using `Math.floor()` ensures that the whole number part is calculated correctly even for negative numbers.  Casting to `int` truncates towards zero, which gives different results for negatives (demonstrated in the example).
* **Clearer Explanations:** Comments explain each step and the different methods used.
* **Illustrates Precision Issues:** The code now shows how using `double` for the fractional part can lead to very small inaccuracies due to the way floating-point numbers are represented. It suggests `BigDecimal` for situations requiring absolute precision.
* **Multiple Examples:** Examples with both positive and negative numbers demonstrate the behavior of the different approaches.


This improved version is more robust, educational, and handles various scenarios more effectively.
