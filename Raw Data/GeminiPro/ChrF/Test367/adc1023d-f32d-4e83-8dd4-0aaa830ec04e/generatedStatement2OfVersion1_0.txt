Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Character Counting Array:** The code now uses an `int[] charCount` of size 256 (to handle ASCII characters) for efficient counting of characters smaller than the current character. This replaces the nested loop and significantly improves performance, especially for larger strings.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:** The `charCount` array is pre-processed to store cumulative counts (prefix sums).  `charCount[i]` will now store the number of characters less than or equal to character `i` seen so far. This allows for O(1) lookup of the count during rank calculation.

3. **Clarity and Correctness:**  The logic for calculating `countRight` and updating `charCount` is more streamlined and accurate.

4. **Method Signatures Maintained:** The code adheres to the required method signatures: `makefactorial(int)`, `calcuLexicoRank(String, int)`, and `main(String[])`.

5. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `calcuLexicoRank` function with a couple of example strings.


This revised version is more efficient and follows best practices for calculating lexicographic rank. It's designed to handle ASCII characters correctly and offers significantly improved performance compared to the previous implementations, especially for strings containing a wider range of characters or longer strings.
