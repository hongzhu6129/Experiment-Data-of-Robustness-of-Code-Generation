Explanation of improvements:


1.  Handles "Impossible" cases: The code explicitly checks for cases where forming the staircase is impossible based on `n`, `k`, and `p` values and prints an appropriate message.
2.  Calculates rows more robustly:  It uses a formula to determine the number of rows instead of iteratively checking, making it more efficient.
3.  Handles the last row correctly: Ensures the last row doesn't use more coins than available by adjusting its coin count.
4.  Uses `k-1` coins on non-k rows: This addresses the core requirement of forming a staircase with `k-1` coins on regular rows and `p` coins on every k-th row more accurately.
5.  Clearer code structure:  Improved variable naming and comments make the code more readable.



This revised code is more complete, efficient, and robust in handling different scenarios.
