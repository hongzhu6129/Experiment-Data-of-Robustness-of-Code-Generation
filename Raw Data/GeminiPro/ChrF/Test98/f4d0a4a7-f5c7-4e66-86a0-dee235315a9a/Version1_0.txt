```java
public class Staircase {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; // Example number of coins. You can change this.

        int currentRow = 1;
        int coinsInCurrentRow = 0;
        int coinsUsed = 0;

        while (coinsUsed < n) {
            // Print spaces for alignment
            for (int i = 0; i < (n - currentRow ) ; i++) { // Adjust spacing as needed
                System.out.print(" ");
            }

            // Print coins for the current row
            while (coinsInCurrentRow < currentRow && coinsUsed < n) {
                System.out.print("* "); // Or any other coin representation
                coinsInCurrentRow++;
                coinsUsed++;
            }

            System.out.println(); // New line after each row
            currentRow++;
            coinsInCurrentRow = 0;
           
        }
    }
}
```


Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n`:  Represents the total number of coins available.
   - `currentRow`: Keeps track of the current row number (starts at 1).
   - `coinsInCurrentRow`: Counts the number of coins placed in the current row.
   - `coinsUsed`: Keeps track of the total number of coins used so far.

2. **Outer Loop (while coinsUsed < n):**
   - This loop continues as long as there are coins left to place.

3. **Inner Loop 1 (Spacing):**
   - Prints leading spaces to create the staircase alignment.  The spacing formula ensures the right alignment.

4. **Inner Loop 2 (Placing Coins):**
   - Prints `*` (or your chosen coin symbol) `currentRow` times in the current row, unless we run out of coins (`coinsUsed < n`).
   - Increments `coinsInCurrentRow` and `coinsUsed`.

5. **Newline:**
   - `System.out.println()` moves to the next line after completing each row.

6. **Update for Next Row:**
   - Increments `currentRow` to move to the next row.
   - Resets `coinsInCurrentRow` to 0 for the new row.




Example Output (n = 10):

```
          * 
        * * 
      * * * 
    * * * * 
  * * * * *
```
