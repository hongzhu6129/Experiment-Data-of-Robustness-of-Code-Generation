**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Output:** The code now prints "t" for `true` and "f" for `false`, making the output easier to read and understand.  It also adds a space after each element for better formatting.

2. **Enhanced Readability:**  The core printing logic is extracted into a separate `printBooleanArray` method.  This improves code organization and makes the `main` method more concise.  It follows good practice to separate concerns and keep the `main` method focused on high-level program flow.

3. **Flexibility:** The `printBooleanArray` method can be easily reused with different boolean arrays without modifying the `main` method.


**Example Usage:**

If you run this code with the provided sample boolean array, the output will be:
