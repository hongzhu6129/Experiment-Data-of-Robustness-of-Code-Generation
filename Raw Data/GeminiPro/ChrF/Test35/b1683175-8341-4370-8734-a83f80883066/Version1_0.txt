```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AsciiValue {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a character: ");
        String input = scanner.nextLine();

        if (input.length() != 1) {
            System.out.println("Please enter a single character.");
            return; // or handle the error differently, like prompting again
        }


        char character = input.charAt(0);
        int asciiValue = (int) character;

        System.out.println("The ASCII value of " + character + " is: " + asciiValue);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

1. **Uppercase Letter:**
   - Input: `Z`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of Z is: 90`

2. **Lowercase Letter:**
   - Input: `a`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of a is: 97`

3. **Digit:**
   - Input: `5`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of 5 is: 53`

4. **Special Character:**
   - Input: `!`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of ! is: 33`

5. **Space:**
   - Input: `" "` (a single space)
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of   is: 32`

6. **Empty Input:**  (Corner Case)
   - Input: `""` (nothing entered)
   - Expected Output: `Please enter a single character.`


7. **Multiple Characters:** (Corner Case)
   - Input: `abc`
   - Expected Output: `Please enter a single character.`

8. **Non-printable character (e.g., tab):** 
    - Input:  `\t` (press the Tab key) � you might need to modify input method in your testing environment to provide a tab character directly.
    - Expected output: `The ASCII value of 	 is: 9`


These test cases cover different types of input, including typical characters, digits, special characters, and corner cases like empty input and multiple characters to ensure the program handles these situations correctly. They also demonstrate how to handle non-printable characters like tabs, which could be relevant depending on the program's intended use.  You should test these in your development environment and perhaps add more specialized tests depending on the specific requirements of your application (e.g., if you only expect letters, add more letter tests with characters like accented letters or other Unicode characters).
