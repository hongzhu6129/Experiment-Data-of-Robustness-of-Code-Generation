Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `j`.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:**  Includes checks for `null` or empty input arrays.

3. **In-Place Modification:** The code directly modifies the input array `nums` as requested.  

4. **Concise Return:** Returns the new length directly.

5. **Comprehensive `main` method:**  Demonstrates the usage with multiple examples, including edge cases (empty and null arrays), and clearly prints the new length and the modified array (only up to the new length).  Using `Arrays.copyOfRange` is crucial here to prevent printing the unmodified parts of the original array.



This revised version addresses the prompt's requirements efficiently and effectively, with better style and more robustness.
