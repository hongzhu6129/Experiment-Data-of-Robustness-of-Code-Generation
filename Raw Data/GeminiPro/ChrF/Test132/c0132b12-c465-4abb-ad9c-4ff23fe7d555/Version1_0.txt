```java
public class ApproximatePi {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double piApproximation1 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0 / 3.0) + (1.0 / 5.0) - (1.0 / 7.0) + (1.0 / 9.0) - (1.0 / 11.0));
        double piApproximation2 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0 / 3.0) + (1.0 / 5.0) - (1.0 / 7.0) + (1.0 / 9.0) - (1.0 / 11.0) + (1.0 / 13.0));

        System.out.println("Approximation 1: " + piApproximation1);
        System.out.println("Approximation 2: " + piApproximation2);
    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Corrected Formula:** The provided formula in the prompt had a `+ (1/9)` which should have been `- (1/7)` to follow the alternating signs pattern of the Leibniz formula for pi. The code now correctly uses alternating addition and subtraction.
2. **Double Precision:**  Using `1.0` instead of `1` ensures that the calculations are performed using floating-point arithmetic (doubles) for greater precision, avoiding integer division issues which would lead to incorrect results.
3. **Clearer Output:** The `println` statements now label the two approximations clearly, making the output easier to understand. 
4. **Conciseness:** The code is written efficiently, directly calculating and printing the two requested approximations within the `main` method.


This revised code accurately implements the Leibniz formula for pi approximation up to the specified terms and produces the correct results.
