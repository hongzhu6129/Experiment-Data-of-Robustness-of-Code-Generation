**Test Cases (with a Parameterized `printFace`)**

1. **Normal Cases:**
   - `printFace("o", "-")`:  Test with standard eyes and mouth (our original face).
   - `printFace("x", "o")`: Test with 'x' eyes and an 'o' mouth.

2. **Boundary/Edge Cases (if applicable):**
   - `printFace("", "")`: Test with empty strings for eyes and mouth (what should happen?).
   - `printFace(null, null)`: Test with null values (should handle gracefully, perhaps with default values).  This is a very important test!

3. **Invalid Input Cases:**
   - `printFace("verylongeyestring", "anotherlongstring")`:  Test with very long strings (should truncate or handle appropriately � maybe throw an exception if that's the designed behavior).



**How to Automate Testing (for the simple version)**

To automate testing the basic `printFace()` (without parameters), you would typically redirect the program's output to a file and then compare that file against a file containing the expected output.


1. **Run and redirect output:**
