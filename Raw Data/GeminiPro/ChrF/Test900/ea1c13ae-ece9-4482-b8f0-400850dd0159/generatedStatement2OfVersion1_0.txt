Improvements in this version:

- **Clearer Node class:** The `Node` class is explicitly defined for better code structure.
- **String to Tree Conversion:** The `buildTreeFromString` method is provided to construct trees from string representations, making testing easier.
- **Comprehensive Testing:**  Multiple test cases are included in `main` to demonstrate different scenarios and validate the logic.
- **Comments:** Comments are added to explain the code logic and purpose.
- **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code explicitly handles cases where either tree is empty (null).


This revised code addresses the issues in the previous versions and provides a more robust and understandable solution. It uses a level-order approach to construct the trees from the input strings, which is a common and efficient method.  The `isSubtree` and `areIdentical` methods are recursive, which is the typical approach for tree comparisons.
