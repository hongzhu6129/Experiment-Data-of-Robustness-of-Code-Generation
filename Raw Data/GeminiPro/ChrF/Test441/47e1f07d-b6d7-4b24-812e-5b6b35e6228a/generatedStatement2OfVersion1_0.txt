Key improvements and explanations in this code:

1. **Clearer Comments:**  The code includes comments explaining the purpose of each part and important details like the 0-indexing of months and the representation of days of the week.

2. **Minimum Year Handling:** The Gregorian calendar doesn't have a true minimum year, but for practical purposes, we've used 1.  A comment explains this.

3. **`Calendar.Constants`:** The code uses `Calendar.JANUARY` and `Calendar.SUNDAY`  for better readability and to avoid magic numbers.

4. **Output Clarity:** The `println` statements clearly label the output values, including an explanation of the 0-indexing for months and the day-of-week numbering.

5. **Correct Minimums:**  The minimum values for month, week of year, and day of week are correctly represented according to Java's `Calendar` class.
