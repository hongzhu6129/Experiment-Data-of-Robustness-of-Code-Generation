Explanation:

1. **Using `toString()`:** The simplest way to convert a `PriorityQueue` to a `String` is to use its built-in `toString()` method. This method returns a string representation of the queue, with elements enclosed in square brackets `[]` and separated by commas.  Keep in mind that the order of elements in the string representation may not be the natural order, reflecting the priority ordering instead.

2. **Iterating and Building a String:**  For more control over the formatting of the output string (e.g., adding custom delimiters, quotes around strings, etc.), you can iterate through the elements of the `PriorityQueue` using a for-each loop and build the string manually using a `StringBuilder` for efficiency.  This method is demonstrated for both `Integer` and `String` PriorityQueues in the example code.  It's important not to modify the PriorityQueue during iteration (e.g. adding/removing elements) as that will cause a `ConcurrentModificationException`.


Important Considerations:

* **Order:** The `PriorityQueue` doesn't guarantee any specific order when converting to a string (except that the head will be the smallest element based on natural ordering or the comparator). The `toString()` method generally reflects the order the elements are stored internally for efficient heap operations, which may not match the order you initially inserted them.
* **Custom Objects:** If you are using a `PriorityQueue` with custom objects, ensure that those objects have a properly overridden `toString()` method, otherwise the output might not be meaningful.
* **String Builder:** Using `StringBuilder` is more efficient than string concatenation using the `+` operator, especially for larger queues.  It avoids creating multiple intermediate string objects.
