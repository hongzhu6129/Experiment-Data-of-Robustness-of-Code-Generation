4. **Large Positive Number:**  (Tests for potential integer overflow if the multiplication results in a number greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. However, since we are only going up to 11, overflow is unlikely unless you use a `byte` or `short` to store the number).
   - Input: `2147483647` (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
   - Expected Output: (Will print correctly up to a point, then might have unexpected behavior if overflow occurs with the multiplication.)

5. **Large Negative Number:** (Similar overflow concerns as above).
   - Input: `-2147483648` (Integer.MIN_VALUE)
   - Expected Output: (Will print correctly up to a point, then might have unexpected behavior if overflow occurs)



**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. **Manual Testing:**  You can run the program and manually enter the test case inputs.  Compare the output with the expected output.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):** Use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a basic example:
