```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileSize {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] filePaths = { "/home/students/abc.txt", "/home/students/test.txt" }; // Array of file paths

        for (String filePath : filePaths) {
            File file = new File(filePath);

            if (file.exists()) {
                long fileSizeInBytes = file.length();
                System.out.println(filePath + ": " + fileSizeInBytes + " bytes");
            } else {
                System.out.println(filePath + ": File not found.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```


This code directly addresses the prompt's requirements:

1. **`public static void main(String[] args)`:** The entry point of the Java program as specified.
2. **Handles multiple files:**  It uses an array `filePaths` to store the paths, making it easy to check multiple files.
3. **`File` class:** Uses the `java.io.File` class to represent files.
4. **`file.exists()`:** Checks if the file exists before attempting to get its size, preventing errors.
5. **`file.length()`:**  Gets the file size in bytes.
6. **Output:** Prints the file path and its size (or a "File not found" message) in the desired format.


To adapt this for your own environment, just change the file paths in the `filePaths` array.  If you run this code as is (and those files don't exist on your system), it will print "File not found" messages. If the files do exist, it will print their actual sizes.
