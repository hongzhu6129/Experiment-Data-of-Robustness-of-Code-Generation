Key improvements in this revised code:

* **`displayPentagonalNumbers` method:**  This new method handles the looping and printing logic, making the `main` method cleaner and more focused.
* **Formatted Output:**  `System.out.printf("%7d ", ...)` is used to format the output so the numbers are aligned in columns and easier to read.  `%7d` ensures each number occupies 7 spaces.
* **Numbers Per Line:** The `numbersPerLine` variable controls how many pentagonal numbers are printed on each line before a newline is added. This makes the output much more organized, especially for a larger number of pentagonal numbers.
* **Clearer Structure:** Separating the calculation (in `getPentagonalNumber`) and the display logic (in `displayPentagonalNumbers`) improves the code's readability and maintainability.  This is good programming practice.


This code will neatly display the first 50 pentagonal numbers, ten per line, in a well-formatted output.
