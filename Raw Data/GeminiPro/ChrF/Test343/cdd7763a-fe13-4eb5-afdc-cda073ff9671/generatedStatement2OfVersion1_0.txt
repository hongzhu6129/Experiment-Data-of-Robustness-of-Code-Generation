Key improvements in this version:

* **More comprehensive test cases:** Includes checks for case sensitivity, different prefix lengths, and the important edge cases of empty and null strings.
* **Clearer output:**  The output now explicitly shows the strings being compared and the result.
* **Robust null handling:**  Demonstrates how to avoid `NullPointerExceptions` when dealing with potentially null strings.  The code now explicitly handles the case where the *main* string might be null, which is a common source of errors.
* **Explanation of startsWith() behavior:** Includes comments that clarify how `startsWith()` handles null and empty prefixes.
