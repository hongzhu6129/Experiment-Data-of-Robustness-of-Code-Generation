```java
public class FermatNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("First 10 Fermat Numbers:");

        for (int n = 0; n < 10; n++) {
            // Calculate Fermat number using Math.pow and explicit type casting to long
            long fermatNumber = (long) (Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, n)) + 1); 
            System.out.println(fermatNumber);
        }
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Explicit Type Casting:**  Fermat numbers grow very rapidly.  Even `long` (64-bit integer) can only hold the first few accurately.  The code uses an explicit cast `(long)` to convert the result of `Math.pow()` to `long`.  This is essential to avoid overflow and handle large Fermat numbers as best as possible within the limitations of `long`.

2. **Clear Output:** The code includes a descriptive message to indicate what the output represents.

3. **Loop for Efficiency:**  A `for` loop iterates from `n = 0` to `n = 9` (inclusive) to calculate and display the first 10 Fermat numbers.

4. **Correct Formula:**  The code implements the correct formula: 2<sup>(2<sup>n</sup>)</sup> + 1.

**Important Note about Overflow:**

Fermat numbers become extremely large very quickly. After the first few, they exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a `long`.  When this happens, overflow occurs, and the results become incorrect. For truly accurate representation of large Fermat numbers, you would need to use specialized libraries like `BigInteger` that can handle arbitrary-precision arithmetic.


Here's a version using `BigInteger` for accurate calculation (though it's not strictly using only `main` as requested, it's much better for correct results):

```java
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class FermatNumbersBigInteger {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("First 10 Fermat Numbers (using BigInteger):");

        for (int n = 0; n < 10; n++) {
            BigInteger two = BigInteger.valueOf(2);
            BigInteger exponent = two.pow(n);
            BigInteger fermatNumber = two.pow(exponent.intValueExact()).add(BigInteger.ONE);  // intValueExact for safety
            System.out.println(fermatNumber);
        }
    }
}
```
