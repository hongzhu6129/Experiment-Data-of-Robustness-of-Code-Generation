**Test Cases (Corner Cases Included):**

1. **Normal Case:** Java is installed and accessible via the system's PATH.  (Expected Output: "Java is installed on your system.")

2. **Java Not Installed:** Java is not present on the system. (Expected Output: "Java is not installed or not accessible in your system's PATH.")

3. **Java Installed but not in PATH:** Java is installed but the `java` executable is not in the system's PATH environment variable.  (Expected Output: "Java is not installed or not accessible in your system's PATH.")  *This is a crucial corner case*.

4. **Java Version String Variations:**  Different Java distributions (OpenJDK, Oracle JDK, etc.) might have slightly different version strings. The code handles "java version" and "openjdk version" to address this. Test with different JDKs if possible.

5. **No Output to Error Stream:** Some Java versions might write version information to standard output instead of error stream.  The code now checks the exit code ( `process.waitFor() == 0` ) to handle this case. This is an important addition.

6. **Permissions Issues:**  The user might not have sufficient permissions to execute the `java` command (though this is less common on typical user accounts). (Expected Output: "Java is not installed or not accessible in your system's PATH.")

**How to Test Corner Cases 3 and 6:**

* **Corner Case 3 (Java not in PATH):**
    1. Temporarily remove Java's bin directory from your system's PATH.  On Windows, this is usually in System Properties -> Environment Variables. On Linux/macOS, edit your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).
    2. Run the Java program.
    3. Restore the original PATH after testing.
* **Corner Case 6 (Permissions Issues):** This is more difficult to simulate reliably. You could try creating a separate user account with restricted permissions, installing Java for that user, and then running the program under that account.



This improved version of the program and the comprehensive test cases should ensure that you can reliably detect the presence (or absence) of a usable Java installation.
