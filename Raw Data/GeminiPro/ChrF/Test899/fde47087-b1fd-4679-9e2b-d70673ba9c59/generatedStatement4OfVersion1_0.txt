Key improvements:

* **Handles all lowercase English alphabet characters:** Uses an array of size 26 to store character counts.
* **Clearer variable names:**  `charCount` is more descriptive than `freq`.
* **Returns -1 for edge cases:** While the problem states there will always be a unique character, it's good practice to handle potential edge cases. I've kept the -1 return for completeness, even though in the given context, it should be unreachable.
* **Added more test cases in `main`:** Demonstrates the function's behavior with various inputs, including cases where the unique character appears later in the string, or where there are both repeating and unique characters.
* **Efficiency:** The code iterates through the string twice at most, making it reasonably efficient (O(n), where n is the length of the string).


This revised version provides better clarity, correctness, and robustness.
