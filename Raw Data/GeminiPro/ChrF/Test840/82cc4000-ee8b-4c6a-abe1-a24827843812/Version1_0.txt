```java
public class Operations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(-5 + 8 * 6); // a. -5 + 8 * 6
        System.out.println((55 + 9) % 9); // b. (55+9) % 9
        System.out.println(20 + -3 * 5 / 8); // c. 20 + -3*5 / 8  (integer division)
        System.out.println(5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3); // d. 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3 (clarified the expression)
    }
}
```

**Explanation and Output:**

* **a. -5 + 8 * 6:** Multiplication has higher precedence than addition.  8 * 6 is 48. Then, -5 + 48 = 43.
* **b. (55 + 9) % 9:** Parentheses are evaluated first. 55 + 9 is 64.  64 % 9 (the remainder when 64 is divided by 9) is 1.
* **c. 20 + -3 * 5 / 8:** Multiplication and division have the same precedence and are evaluated left-to-right. -3 * 5 is -15. Then, -15 / 8 is -1 (because of integer division, the fractional part is discarded). Finally, 20 + -1 is 19.
* **d. 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3:** Division, multiplication, and modulo (%) have the same precedence and are evaluated left-to-right. 15 / 3 is 5.  5 * 2 is 10. 8 % 3 (the remainder when 8 is divided by 3) is 2. Finally, 5 + 10 - 2 = 13.



**Output when the code is run:**

```
43
