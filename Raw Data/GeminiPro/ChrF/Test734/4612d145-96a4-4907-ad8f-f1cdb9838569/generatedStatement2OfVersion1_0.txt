Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:** The code now strictly adheres to the specified `public static void main` and `private static int[] Saddleback` method signatures.

2. **Return an `int[]`:**  The `Saddleback` method now returns an `int[]` of size 2 to store the row and column index.  If the element is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`. This is a much better approach than printing directly from `Saddleback`.

3. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to call `Saddleback` and interpret the results.  It also includes an example where the target is *not* present in the array to show the error handling.

4. **Concise Comments:**  Comments are used effectively to explain the logic within the `Saddleback` search.

5. **Correct Saddleback Search Logic:** The core Saddleback search algorithm is implemented accurately, starting from the top-right corner and moving down or left based on the comparison with the target.


This improved version provides a more robust and clear solution to the problem, following best practices and addressing the initial issues. It's also easier to understand and maintain.
