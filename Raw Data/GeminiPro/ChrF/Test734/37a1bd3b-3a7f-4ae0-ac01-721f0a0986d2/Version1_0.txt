**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Saddleback Search Algorithm:** The core logic utilizes the Saddleback (or Staircase) search algorithm.  It efficiently searches a sorted 2D array by starting at the top-right corner.  

    * If the current element is equal to the target, we've found it.
    * If the current element is smaller than the target, we move down to the next row (since elements increase as we move down).
    * If the current element is larger than the target, we move left to the previous column (since elements decrease as we move left).

2. **Return an Array:** The `Saddleback` method now returns an `int[]` to store both the row and column index of the found element. This makes the result handling cleaner.  If the element is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.

3. **Clearer Main Method:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` method and provides example searches, including a case where the target is not present.

4. **Conciseness and Readability:**  The code is more concise and readable, with improved variable names and comments explaining the logic.



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SaddlebackSearch.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:  `javac SaddlebackSearch.java`
3. **Run:**  `java SaddlebackSearch`


This improved version provides a robust and efficient solution to the saddleback search problem in a well-structured and easily understandable manner.
