Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly adheres to the requested method signatures: `public static void main(String[])` and `private static int[] Saddleback(int[][], int, int, int)`.

2. **Saddleback Search Implementation:** The `Saddleback` method efficiently searches the matrix.  It starts at the top-right corner and moves down or left depending on the comparison with the target.  This leverages the sorted nature of rows and columns.

3. **Return Value:**  The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` where:
   - If the target is found, the array contains the row and column indices (e.g., `{row, col}`).
   - If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`. This clearly indicates the absence of the target.

4. **Informative Output:** The `main` method provides clear output messages indicating whether the target was found and its location if it exists.

5. **Example Usage and Test for Not Found:**  The `main` method includes example usage with a target value and an additional test case demonstrating the scenario when the target is not present in the matrix.
