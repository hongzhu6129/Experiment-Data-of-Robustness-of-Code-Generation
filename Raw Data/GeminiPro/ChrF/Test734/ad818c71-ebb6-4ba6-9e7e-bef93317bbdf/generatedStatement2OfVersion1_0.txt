Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signatures:** The code adheres strictly to the requested `main` and `Saddleback` method signatures.

2. **Saddleback Search Implementation:** The `Saddleback` method efficiently searches the matrix by starting at the top-right corner.  It utilizes the sorted nature of the rows and columns.

3. **Return Array for Coordinates:**  The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` containing the row and column index of the target. If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`. This makes it easy for the `main` method to handle both cases.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function and handles the case where the target is not found.  It also includes an example with a target that isn't in the matrix to show the "not found" handling.

5. **Comments and Readability:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the logic and purpose of each section.  Variable names are descriptive, enhancing readability.


This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and directly addresses the prompt's requirements.
