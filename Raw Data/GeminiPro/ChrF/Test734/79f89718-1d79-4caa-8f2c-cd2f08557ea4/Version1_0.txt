Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `m` and `n` are used for matrix dimensions, making the code easier to understand.

2. **Returns an `int[]`:** The `Saddleback` function returns an `int` array of size 2 to represent the row and column index. This is a more standard and convenient way to return multiple values in Java.  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.

3. **Error Handling:** The `main` method now checks the return value of `Saddleback` and prints an appropriate message whether the target is found or not.

4. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function with a sample matrix and target values (including a case where the target is not present).

5. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic of the `Saddleback` algorithm.

6. **Efficiency:** The Saddleback search algorithm is efficient for sorted matrices.  It avoids unnecessary comparisons by efficiently navigating the matrix based on the target value and the sorted property of the rows and columns.  It has a time complexity of O(m + n), where 'm' is the number of rows and 'n' is the number of columns.


This improved version is more robust, readable, and follows best practices for Java coding.
