Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `m` and `n` for dimensions improves readability.

2. **Return an Array:** The `Saddleback` method now returns an `int[]`  to store both row and column indices. This is cleaner than using separate variables and makes it easier to handle the "not found" case.

3. **"Not Found" Handling:** Returning `{-1, -1}` clearly indicates that the target was not found. The `main` method checks for this and prints an appropriate message.

4. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to call the `Saddleback` method and interpret the results.  It also includes an example to show what happens when the target is *not* present.

5. **Conciseness:**  The code is written efficiently and avoids unnecessary complexity.

6. **Comments:** Added comments explaining the logic and the "saddleback" search strategy within the `Saddleback` method itself.


This improved version addresses the prompt's requirements for method signatures and provides a more robust and understandable solution.
