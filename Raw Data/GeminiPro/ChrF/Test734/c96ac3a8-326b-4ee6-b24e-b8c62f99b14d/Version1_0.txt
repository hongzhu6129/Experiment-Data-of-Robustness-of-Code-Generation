    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] matrix = {
                {1, 2, 3, 4},
                {5, 6, 7, 8},
                {9, 10, 11, 12},
                {13, 14, 15, 16}
        };

        int target = 7;
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;

        int[] result = Saddleback(matrix, target, m, n);

        if (result[0] != -1) {
            System.out.println("Target " + target + " found at row: " + result[0] + ", column: " + result[1]);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Target " + target + " not found in the matrix.");
        }
    }

    private static int[] Saddleback(int[][] matrix, int target, int m, int n) {
        int row = 0;
        int col = n - 1;

        while (row < m && col >= 0) {
            if (matrix[row][col] == target) {
                return new int[]{row, col};
            } else if (matrix[row][col] < target) {
                row++; // Move down to the next row
            } else {
                col--; // Move left to the previous column

    }
}

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Saddleback Search:** The `Saddleback` (or sometimes called `staircase search`) method efficiently searches a sorted 2D array. It starts from the top-right corner.  If the current element is smaller than the target, it moves down (to a larger element). If the current element is larger than the target, it moves left (to a smaller element).

2. **Clearer Return:**  The `Saddleback` function returns an `int[]` of size 2.  If the target is found, the array contains the row and column indices.  If the target is *not* found, it returns `{-1, -1}` to clearly indicate failure.

3. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function. It creates a sample matrix, sets a target value, and then calls `Saddleback` to search. The result is printed to the console.

4. **Error Handling:** The `main` method now checks the result from `Saddleback`. If `{-1, -1}` is returned, it prints a message that the target was not found.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SaddlebackSearch.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:
   ```bash
   javac SaddlebackSearch.java
   ```
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code:
   ```bash
   java SaddlebackSearch 
   ```


This improved version provides a more robust and understandable solution to the saddleback search problem.  It handles the case where the target is not found and makes the code easier to use and maintain.
