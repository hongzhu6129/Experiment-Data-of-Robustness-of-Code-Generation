Explanation:

1. **Create LinkedLists:** We create two `LinkedList` objects, `list1` and `list2`, using the `LinkedList<>()` constructor.  We've used Integer as the generic type, but you can use any other object type.

2. **Populate the Lists:**  The `add()` method adds elements to the end of the linked lists.

3. **Compare using `equals()`:** The core of the comparison is done by the `equals()` method. This method, inherited from the `AbstractList` class, compares the lists element by element and in order.  It returns `true` if the lists are of the same size and contain the same elements in the same order. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

4. **Illustrative Examples:** The code demonstrates various scenarios, including identical lists, lists with different elements, lists with the same elements in a different order, and a list being a subset of another.  This helps understand the behavior of the `equals()` method thoroughly.

5. **Null Check (Example 5):**  It's important to handle cases where one or both of the lists might be `null`.  Attempting to call `equals()` on a `null` object will result in a `NullPointerException`. The example shows how to safely check for null using `==` before attempting the comparison.


This comprehensive example makes it clear how to compare `LinkedLists` in Java and handles different scenarios you might encounter, including the essential null check.
