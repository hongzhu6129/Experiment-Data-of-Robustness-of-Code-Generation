```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        double num1 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        double num2 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Sum: " + (num1 + num2));
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (num1 - num2));
        System.out.println("Product: " + (num1 * num2));

        if (num2 != 0) {

        } else {
            System.out.println("Division by zero is not allowed.");

**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner cases, to test the program thoroughly:

**Normal Cases:**

1. **Input:** num1 = 10, num2 = 5
   **Expected Output:**
   Sum: 15.0
   Difference: 5.0
   Product: 50.0
   Quotient: 2.0
   Remainder: 0.0

2. **Input:** num1 = -5, num2 = 2
   **Expected Output:**
   Sum: -3.0
   Difference: -7.0
   Product: -10.0
   Quotient: -2.5
   Remainder: -1.0

3. **Input:** num1 = 7.5, num2 = 2.5
   **Expected Output:**
   Sum: 10.0
   Difference: 5.0
   Product: 18.75
   Quotient: 3.0
   Remainder: 0.0


**Corner Cases:**

4. **Division by Zero:** num1 = 10, num2 = 0
   **Expected Output:**
   Sum: 10.0
   Difference: 10.0
   Product: 0.0
   Division by zero is not allowed.
   Remainder operation by zero is not allowed.

5. **Integer Overflow (if using `int` instead of `double`):**  num1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE, num2 = 1
   **Expected Output (with `int`):**  Incorrect results due to overflow.  This is why `double` is used in the provided code to handle larger numbers and avoid this issue.
   **Expected Output (with `double`):** Correct results.


6. **Zero as an operand:** num1 = 0, num2 = 5
   **Expected Output:**
    Sum: 5.0
    Difference: -5.0
    Product: 0.0
    Quotient: 0.0
    Remainder: 0.0


7. **Large numbers:** num1 = 1e10, num2 = 1e5  (Test how the program handles large values).
   **Expected Output:** Should provide correct results.




**How to Run the Tests:**

You can either manually input these test cases or, better yet, create a separate test class using a testing framework like JUnit to automate the testing process. JUnit allows you to write assertions to verify that the actual output of your program matches the expected output for each test case.  This is the best practice for ensuring code correctness.



```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class ArithmeticOperationsTest {

    @Test
    void testNormalCase1() {
        // Set up inputs (you might need to modify the ArithmeticOperations 
        // class to make methods testable without System.in/out)
        // ...

        // Call the methods and get the results
        // ...

        // Assertions
        assertEquals(15.0, sum);  // Example
        // ... other assertions
    }

    // ... more test methods for other cases
}
```
