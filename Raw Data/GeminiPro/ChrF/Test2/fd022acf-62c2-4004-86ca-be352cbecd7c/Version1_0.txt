    public static void main(String[] args) {

**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -5 | -2 | -7 | -3 | 10 | 2.5 | -0.0 (or 0.0) | 
| 3. Mixed Signs | 10 | -2 | 8 | 12 | -20 | -5.0 | 0.0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 (Corner Case) | 5 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 0 | Division by zero error | Division by zero error |
| 6. Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 7. Decimal Numbers | 5.5 | 2.5 | 8.0 | 3.0 | 13.75 | 2.2 | 0.5 |
| 8. Integer Overflow (Corner Case � if using `int` instead of `double`) | Integer.MAX_VALUE | 1 |  Overflow | Overflow | Overflow |  Overflow | Overflow |
| 9. Integer Underflow (Corner Case � if using `int` instead of `double`)| Integer.MIN_VALUE | -1| Underflow | Underflow| Overflow | Underflow | Underflow |



**Explanation of Corner Cases:**

* **Division by Zero:**  Attempting to divide by zero will result in an `ArithmeticException`.  The code now handles this by checking for `num2 == 0` and displaying an appropriate message.
* **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**  If you were using the `int` data type instead of `double`, very large or very small numbers could cause the calculations to wrap around (overflow or underflow), leading to incorrect results.  Using `double` provides a much wider range, minimizing this risk.

**How to run the test cases:**

You can manually enter these values when prompted by the program, or, for a more automated approach, consider writing unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit.  This will allow you to easily and repeatedly run these test cases and verify the correctness of your program.


Using the provided test cases helps you ensure that your `ArithmeticOperations` program functions correctly under various scenarios, including potential problem areas.  It's a good practice to test your code thoroughly, especially when dealing with mathematical operations.
