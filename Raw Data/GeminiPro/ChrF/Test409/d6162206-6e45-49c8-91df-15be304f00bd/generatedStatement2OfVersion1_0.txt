Key improvements in this version:

- **Clearer Null Handling:** The `removeString` method explicitly checks for null inputs and returns the `mainString` if either is null.  You can adapt this to throw an exception or handle nulls differently as per your application's requirements.
- **More Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method includes several test cases, including examples where the `removeString` appears multiple times, is at the beginning/end of the `mainString`, and also tests null input handling.
- **Concise and Efficient:** The use of `String.replace()` provides a clean and efficient way to remove all occurrences of the substring.
- **Informative Output:** The `main` method prints both the original and modified strings, making it easy to verify the results.
