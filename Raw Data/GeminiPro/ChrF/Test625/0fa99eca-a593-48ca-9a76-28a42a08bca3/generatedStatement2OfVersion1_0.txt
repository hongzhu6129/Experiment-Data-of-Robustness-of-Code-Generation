Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Generics:** The `tailSet` method now uses generics `<T>` to work with any comparable data type (e.g., Integer, String, Double), making it more versatile.

2. **Creating a Copy:** The `tailSet` method now creates a *copy* of the tail set using `new TreeSet<>(set.tailSet(element))`. This is crucial because the `tailSet()` method of `TreeSet` returns a *view* of the original set. If you were to modify the returned view, the original `TreeSet` would also be modified, which might not be the desired behavior in many cases. By creating a copy, the original `TreeSet` remains unchanged.

3. **Clearer Example Usage:** The `main` method provides more comprehensive examples, including cases where the element is present in the set, greater than all elements in the set, and using a `TreeSet` of Strings.

4. **Comments:**  Comments are added to explain the purpose of the code and the importance of creating a copy.


This improved version addresses the potential issue of modifying the original `TreeSet` and provides a more robust and reusable solution.
