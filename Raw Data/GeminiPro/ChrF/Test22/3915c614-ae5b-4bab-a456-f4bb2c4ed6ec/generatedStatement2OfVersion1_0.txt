**Test Cases:**

1. **Valid Octal:**
   - Input: 123
   - Expected Output: Hexadecimal equivalent: 53

2. **Leading Zeros:**
   - Input: 00077
   - Expected Output: Hexadecimal equivalent: 3F

3. **Zero:**
   - Input: 0
   - Expected Output: Hexadecimal equivalent: 0


4. **Large Octal:**
   - Input: 7777777
   - Expected Output: Hexadecimal equivalent: FFFFF

5. **Invalid Octal (Contains 8 or 9):**
   - Input: 1283
   - Expected Output: Invalid octal number: Contains characters other than 0-7

6. **Invalid Octal (Contains letters):**
   - Input: 1A3
   - Expected Output: Invalid octal number: Contains characters other than 0-7

7. **Empty Input:**
   - Input: "" (just press enter)
   - Expected Output:  (The program handles this gracefully and does not crash. Some enhancement could be added to specifically check and report empty input).



These test cases cover various scenarios, including valid octal numbers, octal numbers with leading zeros, the corner case of zero, a large octal number, and invalid octal numbers containing digits other than 0-7 or letters. They ensure that the program handles both valid and invalid inputs correctly.
