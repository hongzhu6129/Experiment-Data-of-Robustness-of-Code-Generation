**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`isCube(int num)` Function:**
   - Handles negative numbers by checking the absolute value.
   - Handles zero correctly.
   - Uses an efficient binary search algorithm to find the cube root rather than brute force.  Binary search is significantly faster for larger numbers. This avoids potential integer overflow issues if we directly calculated `num^(1/3)`.

2. **`testCube(int num)` Function:**
   - This helper function keeps the `main` method cleaner and allows you to easily test different input values.

3. **Clarity and Readability:**
   - Comments explain the logic.
   - Clear variable names.
   - Consistent formatting.

4. **Handles Edge Cases:**
   - The code correctly handles negative numbers, zero, and large numbers (within the range of `int`).


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CubeChecker.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where you saved the file and run: `javac CubeChecker.java`
3. **Run:**  `java CubeChecker`


The output will show the test results for the various numbers.
