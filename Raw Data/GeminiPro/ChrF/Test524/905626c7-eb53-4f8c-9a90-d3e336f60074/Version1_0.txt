```java
public class CubeChecker {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Input number (replace with user input or other methods as needed)
        int number = 8; 

        // Check if the number is a perfect cube
        if (isCube(number)) {
            System.out.println("Number is a cube.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number is not a cube.");
        }

        // Example with other inputs:
        checkCube(27);  // Output: Number is a cube.
        checkCube(10);  // Output: Number is not a cube.
        checkCube(-8); // Output: Number is a cube.
    }



    // Efficient method to check if a number is a perfect cube
    private static boolean isCube(int n) {
        if (n < 0) { // Handle negative numbers (cubes can be negative)
            n = -n;
        }

        // Binary search for cube root
        long low = 0;
        long high = n;

        while (low <= high) {
            long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;  // Avoid potential overflow
            long cube = mid * mid * mid;

            if (cube == n) {
                return true;
            } else if (cube < n) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }


    // Alternative method (less efficient for large numbers but simpler) for demonstration
    private static void checkCube(int num) {
         double cubeRoot = Math.cbrt(num);
        if (cubeRoot == Math.round(cubeRoot)) {
            System.out.println("Number is a cube.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number is not a cube.");
        }

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:**  The `isCube` method now correctly handles negative cubes. The cube root of a negative number is real (e.g., the cube root of -8 is -2).

2. **Efficient Cube Root Calculation (Binary Search):** Instead of using `Math.cbrt` (which can be slower and might have precision issues for very large numbers),  `isCube` uses an efficient binary search approach to find the cube root. This approach ensures good performance even for large integer inputs.

3. **Overflow Prevention:** The `mid` calculation in the binary search uses `long` and avoids potential `int` overflow by using `low + (high - low) / 2`.

4. **Clearer Method Separation:** The code is structured with separate methods for clarity: `main`, `isCube`, and `checkCube` (the less efficient, but perhaps more readily understood, version).

5. **Example Usage:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use both methods and includes examples with different inputs (positive, negative, cube, and non-cube numbers).

6. **Comments and Explanations:** The code is well-commented to explain the logic and reasoning behind the chosen approach.
