```java
public class TwinkleTwinkle {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printTwinkleTwinkle();
    }

    public static void printTwinkleTwinkle() {
        System.out.println("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,");
        System.out.println("\tHow I wonder what you are!");
        System.out.println("\t\tUp above the world so high,");
        System.out.println("\t\tLike a diamond in the sky.");
        System.out.println("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,");
        System.out.println("\tHow I wonder what you are!");
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

While this program doesn't take any input, we can still consider some aspects for testing:

1. **Correct Output:**  Verify that the output matches the expected format precisely, including capitalization, punctuation, and indentation (tabs).  Visually compare the program's output to the desired output.  This is the primary test.

2. **Platform Independence:** Test the code on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and Java versions to ensure consistent output.  Line endings (\r\n vs. \n) can sometimes vary, so check for that.

3. **Character Encoding:** While less likely an issue with this specific program, for more complex output involving special characters, ensure your output uses a consistent character encoding (e.g., UTF-8).  You might introduce a test that checks for the correct display of special characters if your rhyme were modified to include them.


**"Corner Cases" (In a Broader Sense):**

For this particular program, true corner cases are limited because there's no input to manipulate. However, thinking about related scenarios can be valuable:

* **Modified Rhyme:**  If the rhyme were to change (longer lines, different indentation), how easily could you adapt the `printTwinkleTwinkle()` method?  This tests the maintainability and flexibility of your code. Create test cases with different versions of the rhyme.

* **Internationalization:** If you needed to support different languages (with varying line lengths and characters), how would you handle that?  This tests the design for potential future requirements.  While not strictly a corner case for the original program, it's a valuable consideration.


**Example of a Modified Rhyme Test:**

```java
// In a separate test class (e.g., using JUnit)
public class TwinkleTwinkleTest {
    @Test
    public void testModifiedRhyme() {
        ByteArrayOutputStream outContent = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        System.setOut(new PrintStream(outContent));

        TwinkleTwinkle.printTwinkleTwinkleModified(); // Call a modified version of the function

        String expectedOutput = "Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how bright you are!\n" + // Note: Different rhyme and no tabs
                "\tUp so high, like a diamond,\n" + 
                "\tShining in the night sky.\n"; 

        assertEquals(expectedOutput, outContent.toString());
        System.setOut(System.out); // Restore standard output
    }
}

```

By thinking about these "extended" test cases, even for a simple program, you develop good habits for writing more robust and adaptable code.
