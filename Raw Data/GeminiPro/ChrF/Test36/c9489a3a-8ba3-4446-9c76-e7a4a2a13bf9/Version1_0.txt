```java
public class TwinkleTwinkle {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printFormattedTwinkleTwinkle();
    }

    public static void printFormattedTwinkleTwinkle() {
        System.out.println("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,");
        System.out.println("\tHow I wonder what you are!");
        System.out.println("\t\tUp above the world so high,");
        System.out.println("\t\tLike a diamond in the sky.");
        System.out.println("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,");
        System.out.println("\tHow I wonder what you are!");


    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

While this specific program doesn't have complex logic that requires extensive testing, we can still consider some aspects:

1. **Basic Functionality:**  Does it print the poem correctly formatted as specified in the prompt? (This is the primary test).

2. **Whitespace and Indentation:** Pay close attention to ensure the tabs (`\t`) are producing the correct indentation levels.  Visually inspect the output.

3. **Newlines:** Verify that each line ends with a newline character, resulting in the desired line breaks.

4. **Character Case and Punctuation:**  The poem should be printed with correct capitalization, commas, and exclamation points as in the original text.

5. **Unicode Characters:**  While not present in the original poem, a more robust test might include Unicode characters (e.g., accented letters, other symbols) to ensure the program handles them correctly (Java generally handles Unicode well, but it's good to be aware of this in more complex scenarios).


**Corner Cases (Less applicable here, but for illustration in similar programs):**

In programs dealing with string manipulation or input, you would typically consider corner cases like:

* **Empty String:**  If the poem was stored in a variable, what if the variable was an empty string?
* **Very Long Strings:** How would the formatting behave with extremely long lines in the poem?
* **Null Strings:** What happens if the string variable is null?  (This would cause a `NullPointerException` unless handled explicitly).
* **Special Characters:** Test with strings containing special characters like tabs, newlines, and escape sequences within the poem itself (e.g., if the poem itself contained a `\t`).



For this particular program, the tests are primarily focused on verifying the correct output formatting according to the given specification.  The other corner cases are less relevant in this specific instance, but are included to demonstrate general testing principles for string manipulation.
