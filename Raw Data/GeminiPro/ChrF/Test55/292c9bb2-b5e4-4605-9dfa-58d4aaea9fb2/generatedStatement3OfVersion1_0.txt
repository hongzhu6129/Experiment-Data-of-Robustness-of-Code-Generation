**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Handles Negative Numbers:** The code now correctly handles negative dividends and divisors, ensuring consistent results with the standard modulo operator.
* **Handles Zero Divisor:** The `ArithmeticException` is explicitly thrown when the divisor is zero, preventing crashes and providing a clear error message.
* **Clearer Logic:** The repeated subtraction method is straightforward and easy to understand.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including positive and negative numbers, zero dividend and divisor, and even large numbers near the integer limits.  This ensures the `modulus()` method behaves as expected.
* **Uses JUnit 5:**  The tests are now written using JUnit 5, a standard and powerful testing framework for Java.  You'll need to add the JUnit 5 library to your project to run these tests.





Now you have a robust, well-tested implementation of the modulus operation without using the built-in `%` operator.  The use of JUnit ensures that it continues to work correctly as you make changes or additions to your code.
