Key improvements:

* **Correct Star Pattern:** The stars now alternate correctly in each row, creating the staggered effect seen on the flag.
* **Simplified Stripe Printing:** Using `String.repeat()` makes the code for printing the stripes much cleaner and easier to understand.
* **Consistent Spacing:** Ensures consistent spacing between the star field and the stripes.
* **Correct Proportions:** The output is now closer to the intended flag proportions by adjusting the number of repetitions for the stripes.  It's still a simplified text representation but visually more balanced.


This improved version provides a more accurate and cleaner representation of the American flag within the constraints of a text-based output.
