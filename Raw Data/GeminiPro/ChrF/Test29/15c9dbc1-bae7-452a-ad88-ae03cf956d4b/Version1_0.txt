    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the length of a side of the regular hexagon: ");
        double sideLength = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Handle invalid input (side length cannot be negative or zero)
        if (sideLength <= 0) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input. Side length must be positive.");
            return; // Exit the program
        }

        double area = (3 * Math.sqrt(3) * sideLength * sideLength) / 2;

        System.out.println("The area of the hexagon is: " + area);

        scanner.close();



        // Test cases (inline within main - as requested - not ideal practice but fulfills the prompt):
        double side1 = 5;
        double expectedArea1 = (3 * Math.sqrt(3) * side1 * side1) / 2;
        System.out.println("Test case 1: side = " + side1 + ", expected area = " + expectedArea1);



        double side2 = 1; // Edge case: small side
        double expectedArea2 = (3 * Math.sqrt(3) * side2 * side2) / 2;
        System.out.println("Test case 2: side = " + side2 + ", expected area = " + expectedArea2);


        double side3 = 100; // Edge Case: large side
        double expectedArea3 = (3 * Math.sqrt(3) * side3 * side3) / 2;
        System.out.println("Test case 3: side = " + side3 + ", expected area = " + expectedArea3);

**Test Cases and Corner Cases:**

1. **Positive Side Length:**  `sideLength = 5` (or any positive number).  This tests the standard calculation.

2. **Small Side Length:** `sideLength = 1` or `sideLength = 0.5`.  This checks if the formula works correctly for small values, ensuring no unexpected behavior like rounding errors causing significant inaccuracies.

3. **Large Side Length:** `sideLength = 100` or `sideLength = 1000`.  Tests behavior with larger numbers, again to check for potential overflow or rounding errors.

4. **Zero Side Length:** `sideLength = 0`. This is an invalid input. The program should handle this gracefully and not crash. My improved code includes an explicit check for this and other invalid inputs.

5. **Negative Side Length:** `sideLength = -5`.  This is another invalid input. The program should handle this appropriately,  providing an error message like the updated code does.  A hexagon cannot have a negative side length.


**How to run the test cases:**

Since the "test cases" are now incorporated directly into `main`, you'll see the test results printed to the console after you provide an initial side length as input when you run the program.


**Important Note:**  While the prompt asks for everything to be in `main`, this isn't good practice for real-world programs.  Ideally, you would separate the area calculation logic into its own method and have separate test methods (using a testing framework like JUnit) to keep your code organized, testable, and maintainable.   The provided code fulfills the prompt's unusual constraints but wouldn't be the recommended structure for a production-quality application.
