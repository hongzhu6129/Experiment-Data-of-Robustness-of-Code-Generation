**Educational Paper: Checking Well-Repetition in Discrete Sequences**

**Introduction**

In the realm of discrete mathematics, the concept of well-repetition plays a significant role. A sequence is said to be well-repetition if every element of the sequence appears at least twice. Determining whether a given sequence is well-repetition is crucial in various fields, such as computer science, pattern recognition, and signal processing.

This paper presents an efficient algorithm for checking well-repetition in discrete sequences using Java. The algorithm employs a hash table to keep track of the frequency of each element in the sequence, enabling efficient retrieval and comparison of counts.

**Algorithm**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty hash table and iterate through the sequence, adding each element as a key with an initial count of 0.

2. **Frequency Tracking:** As the sequence is traversed, increment the count associated with each key in the hash table.

3. **Checking Well-Repetition:** After processing the entire sequence, iterate through the hash table. If any key has a count less than 2, the sequence is not well-repetition. Otherwise, the sequence is well-repetition.

**Java Implementation**

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class WellRepetitionChecker {

    public static boolean checkWellRepetition(int[] sequence) {
        // Initialize the hash table
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Track the frequency of each element
        for (int element : sequence) {
            frequencyMap.put(element, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(element, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Check for well-repetition
        for (Integer count : frequencyMap.values()) {
            if (count < 2) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

**Test Cases**

**Positive Test Cases:**

* [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3] (well-repetition)
* [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 10, 20, 30] (well-repetition)

**Negative Test Cases:**

* [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (not well-repetition)
* [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 10, 20] (not well-repetition)

**Corner Cases:**

* [1] (well-repetition)
* [] (not well-repetition)
* [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (well-repetition)
* [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1] (well-repetition)
