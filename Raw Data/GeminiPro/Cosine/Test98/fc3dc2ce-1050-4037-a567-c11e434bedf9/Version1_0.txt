```java
public class Staircase {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; // Example: Build a staircase with 10 coins

        int rows = 0;
        int coinsUsed = 0;
        int currentRowCoins = 1;

        while (coinsUsed + currentRowCoins <= n) {
            coinsUsed += currentRowCoins;
            currentRowCoins++; // Next row needs one more coin
            rows++;
        }


        // Print the staircase
        int coinsLeft = n;
        for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i && coinsLeft >0 ; j++) {
                System.out.print("* ");
                coinsLeft--;
            }

            System.out.println();
        }

        //Handle any remaining coins: This part prints the remaining coins on a new row if n is not a perfect "staircase number"
        if(coinsLeft>0)
        {
            for(int i = 0; i < coinsLeft; i++){
                System.out.print("* ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }


    }
}
```


Here's how the code works within the constraints of a single `main` method:

1. **Initialization:** 
   - `n` stores the total number of coins.
   - `rows` keeps track of the number of complete rows.
   - `coinsUsed` tracks the total coins used so far.
   - `currentRowCoins` stores the number of coins needed for the current row.

2. **Calculate Rows:** The `while` loop determines the number of complete rows that can be formed using the given `n` coins, following the rule that the `k`-th row has `k` coins.

3. **Print Staircase:** The nested `for` loops print the staircase structure. The outer loop iterates through each row, and the inner loop prints the required number of '*' characters (representing coins) for each row.

4. **Handle Remaining Coins (Important):** The additional `if` block at the end checks if there are any coins left over (`coinsLeft > 0`).  This addresses cases where the input `n` doesn't perfectly create full rows (e.g., n=10). The remaining coins are printed on a new line.


**Example Output (n=10):**
