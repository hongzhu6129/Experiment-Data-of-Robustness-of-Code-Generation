Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Examples:** The code now includes examples with different data types (String, Integer, Character, Double) to show how to insert at the end of `LinkedList`s of various types.
2. **`offer()` and `addLast()`:** The code demonstrates `offer()` and `addLast()` which are also used for inserting at the end.  `offer()` is generally preferred if you want your code to be compatible with Queue interfaces. `addLast()` is very explicit in its intent.
3. **Explanations in comments:**  Comments explain the purpose of each part of the code and highlight the different methods used to achieve the same outcome (inserting at the end).
4. **Output Clarity:** The `println()` statements clearly show the initial and modified `LinkedList`s for each example, making it easy to understand the insertion process.
5. **Best Practice � `add()`:** While `offer()`, `addLast()`, and `add()` work for insertion at the end, using just `add()` without an index is usually the most concise and commonly used way to add to the end of a LinkedList in Java.  The code emphasizes this.
