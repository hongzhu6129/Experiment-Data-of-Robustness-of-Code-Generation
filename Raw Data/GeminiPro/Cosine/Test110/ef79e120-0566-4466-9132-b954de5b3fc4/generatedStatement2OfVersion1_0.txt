Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles null or empty matrices, as well as matrices with empty rows.  This prevents `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
* **Clearer variable names:**  `m` and `n` are used for rows and columns, improving readability.
* **Efficient search:** Uses binary search (treating the matrix as a sorted 1D array) for O(log(m*n)) time complexity.
* **Concise code:** The logic within the `while` loop is simplified and easier to follow.
* **Robust `main` method:** The `main` method demonstrates the usage of the `searchMatrix` function with various test cases, including edge cases. This helps verify correctness.
