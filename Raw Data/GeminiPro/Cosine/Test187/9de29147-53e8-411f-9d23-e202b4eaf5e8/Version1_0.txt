**Test Cases:**

**Corner Cases:**

* Two empty strings.
* Two strings that are equal except for case differences.
* Two strings that are equal except for whitespace characters.
* A string and an empty string.
* A string and a null value.

**Normal Cases:**

* Two strings that are lexicographically equal.
* Two strings that are lexicographically different.
* Two strings that are lexicographically different, but have the same length.
* Two strings that are lexicographically different, but have different lengths.
