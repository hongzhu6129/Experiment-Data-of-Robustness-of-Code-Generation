Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Comments:** Added comments to explain the different methods.
* **Java 8+ Method (Preferred):** Shows how to use `java.time.Instant`, which is generally preferred in modern Java for time-related operations.  It's more robust and has a cleaner API.
* **Formatting Option (Commented Out):** Provides a commented-out example of how you could format the timestamp into a specific string representation if needed, using `DateTimeFormatter`. This helps if you want to control the output format.  I left it commented as the prompt specifically asked for the timestamp, not a formatted string.
* **`java.sql.Timestamp` still included:** Keeps the original `java.sql.Timestamp` example for completeness, but highlights that `Instant` is generally better.
