Key improvements and explanations:

* **Test Cases:**  The code now includes a comprehensive set of JUnit 5 test cases.  These test cases cover:
    * Positive radius
    * Zero radius
    * Very small radius (corner case)
    * Negative radius (corner case � in a real application, you might want to throw an exception for invalid input)
    * Large Radius

* **Delta for Comparisons:** When comparing floating-point numbers, you should always use a delta (tolerance) because of potential rounding errors. The `assertEquals` method with a delta parameter is used to address this.  The delta has been adjusted for extremely small values to ensure accurate comparisons.

* **Clearer Main Method:** The `main` method is more focused on demonstrating the calculations for the given radius.

* **JUnit 5:** Uses JUnit 5 for testing, which is the current standard for Java testing.


How to compile and run the tests:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CircleCalculations.java` and `CircleCalculationsTest.java` in the same directory.

2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory and compile:
