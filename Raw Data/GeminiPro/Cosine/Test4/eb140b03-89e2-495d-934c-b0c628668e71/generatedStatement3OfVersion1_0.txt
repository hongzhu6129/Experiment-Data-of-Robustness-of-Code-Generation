Key improvements and explanations in the test cases:

* **JUnit 5:**  Uses JUnit 5 for cleaner test structure.
* **`@Test` Annotation:**  Clearly marks test methods.
* **Input Redirection:** Uses `ByteArrayInputStream` and `ByteArrayOutputStream` to simulate user input and capture program output, making testing easier.
* **`assertEquals()`:** Verifies that the actual output matches the expected output.
* **Corner Cases:** Includes tests for radius 0 and negative radius.  The negative radius test demonstrates how to check for an exception.
* **Helper Methods:** Uses helper methods (`testWithInput`, `injectInputAndRun`) to keep the test code organized and reusable.
* **Restoring System.in/out:**  Crucially restores `System.in` and `System.out` to their original state after each test to avoid interfering with other tests or the console.
* **Exception Handling:** Shows how to test for expected exceptions using `assertThrows()`.  I've commented on how you would need to modify your `CircleCalculations` class to actually throw the exception if that's your intended behavior for negative radius.




This improved test suite provides much more robust and comprehensive testing of your `CircleCalculations` class, covering typical inputs and important edge cases. Remember to add the JUnit 5 library to your project.
