Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles empty arrays:** The code now correctly handles the case where the input array is empty.
* **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueCount` more accurately reflects the variable's purpose.
* **Improved comments:**  The comments explain the logic more clearly.
* **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use `removeDuplicates` and how to print the updated array using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid showing the unchanged (duplicate) elements.  It also includes more test cases (empty array and a longer array with duplicates).


This version directly modifies the input array `nums` (as the original problem seemed to intend) and returns the length of the updated array with duplicates removed.  The original elements of the array beyond the updated length are untouched (but should be ignored � hence the use of `Arrays.copyOfRange`).
