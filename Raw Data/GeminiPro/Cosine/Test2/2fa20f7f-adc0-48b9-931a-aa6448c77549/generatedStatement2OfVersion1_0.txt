**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Positive Integers | 10 | 5 | Sum: 15.0 <br> Difference: 5.0 <br> Product: 50.0 <br> Quotient: 2.0 <br> Remainder: 0.0 |
| Negative Integers | -10 | -5 | Sum: -15.0 <br> Difference: -5.0 <br> Product: 50.0 <br> Quotient: 2.0 <br> Remainder: 0.0 |
| Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | Sum: 5.0 <br> Difference: 15.0 <br> Product: -50.0 <br> Quotient: -2.0 <br> Remainder: 0.0 |
| Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | Sum: 5.0 <br> Difference: -5.0 <br> Product: 0.0 <br> Quotient: 0.0 <br> Remainder: 0.0 |
| Zero as num2 (Division by Zero) | 10 | 0 | Sum: 10.0 <br> Difference: 10.0 <br> Product: 0.0 <br> Division by zero is not allowed. <br> Remainder approaches infinity (positive or negative based on the sign of num1). |
| Zero as both num1 and num2| 0 | 0 | Sum: 0.0 <br> Difference: 0.0 <br> Product: 0.0 <br> Division by zero is not allowed. <br> Remainder is undefined when dividing by zero. |
| Floating-Point Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | Sum: 13.0 <br> Difference: 8.0 <br> Product: 26.25 <br> Quotient: 4.2 <br> Remainder: 0.0 |
| Large Numbers | 1000000 | 1000 | Sum: 1001000.0 <br> Difference: 999000.0 <br> Product: 1.0E9 <br> Quotient: 1000.0 <br> Remainder: 0.0 |



**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. **Manually:** You can run the program multiple times, entering each set of test case inputs and verifying the output against the expected values.

2. **Unit Testing (Recommended):**  A more robust approach is to use JUnit (or a similar testing framework) to automate the testing process.  This involves writing separate test methods for each scenario. Here's a simple example using JUnit 5:
