 Only use the method signatures  void cocktailSort(int[]), public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program to sort an array of positive integers using the Cocktail sort algorithm.\nCocktail shaker sort (also known as bidirectional bubble sort, cocktail sort, shaker sort, ripple sort, shuffle sort, or shuttle sort ) is a variation of bubble sort that is both a stable sorting algorithm and a comparison sort. The algorithm differs from a bubble sort in that it sorts in both directions on each pass through the list. This sorting algorithm is only marginally more difficult to implement than a bubble sort and solves the problem of turtles in bubble sorts. It provides only marginal performance improvements, and does not improve asymptotic performance; like the bubble sort, it is not of practical interest, though it finds some use in education. \n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n Avoid using Solution as the class name.
