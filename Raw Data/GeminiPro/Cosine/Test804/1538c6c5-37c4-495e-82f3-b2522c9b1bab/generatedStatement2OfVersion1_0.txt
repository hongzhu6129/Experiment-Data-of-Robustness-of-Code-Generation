Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct Stripe Alternation:** The code now correctly alternates between rows of 6 and 5 stars to create the striped effect.
* **Cleaned up Looping:** The loop structure is simplified and more efficient. The awkward `if/else` inside the loop has been removed. A single loop handles pairs of stripe rows, and a `break` statement prevents extra lines.
* **Correct Number of Stripes and Solid Rows:** The code now prints exactly 6 pairs of stripes (12 rows total) and 6 rows of solid "red," matching the problem's specification.
* **Improved Readability:**  Better spacing and comments make the code easier to understand.
* **Correct Equal Sign Count:** Ensures the correct number of equal signs are printed on each line.



This revised code produces the desired output, accurately representing the basic structure of an American flag as requested by the prompt within the constraints of using only the `main` method.
