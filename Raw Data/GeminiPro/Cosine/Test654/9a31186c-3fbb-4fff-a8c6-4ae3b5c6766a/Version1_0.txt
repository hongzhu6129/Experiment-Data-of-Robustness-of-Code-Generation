Key improvements:

* **Clearer Graduation Logic:** The `graduateGrade()` method now clearly defines how grades are updated upon graduation. You can easily customize this logic to fit your specific requirements.
* **Handles Non-Existent Students:** The code now checks if the student ID exists in the TreeMap before attempting to graduate. This prevents `NullPointerExceptions` and provides a user-friendly message.
* **Improved Output:**  The output messages are more informative, indicating the previous grade and the updated grade after graduation.
* **Example of Non-Existent Student:** The `main` method includes an example demonstrating how the code handles attempts to graduate a student who isn't in the records.


Now, the code is more robust, easier to understand, and provides better feedback to the user. You can adjust the graduation logic in `graduateGrade()` to suit your specific grading system.
