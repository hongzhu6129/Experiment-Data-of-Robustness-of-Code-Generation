Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Copying Array in `permute`:** The most critical fix is adding `arr.clone()` inside the `permute` method.  This creates a copy of the array before adding it to the `permutations` list. Without this, you're adding the same array object multiple times, and as the array gets modified in place, all entries in the list reflect those changes.

2. **Backtracking in `permute`:**  The `swap` after the recursive `permute` call implements backtracking. This is crucial to restore the array to its previous state before exploring other permutations.  This ensures you generate all possible permutations correctly.

3. **`isSorted` Method:** This function checks if the array is sorted in ascending order.

4. **Clarity and Comments:**  Added comments to explain the code's logic.



**Important Note on Efficiency:** Permutation Sort is a highly inefficient sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n * n!).  It's not practical for any real-world scenarios except for very small arrays.  It's primarily used for educational purposes to demonstrate the concept of permutations.  For real-world applications, use efficient algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, or the built-in `Arrays.sort()`.
