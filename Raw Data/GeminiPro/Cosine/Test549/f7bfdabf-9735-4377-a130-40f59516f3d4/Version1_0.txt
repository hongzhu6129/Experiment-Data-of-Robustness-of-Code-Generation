import java.util.List;

public class FileToArray {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String filePath = "your_file.txt"; 

        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {

            List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();  // Use a List to store lines dynamically
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                lines.add(line);
            }

            // Convert the List to an array if you absolutely need an array
            String[] linesArray = lines.toArray(new String[0]);

            // Print the array (or process it as needed)
            System.out.println(Arrays.toString(linesArray)); 

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code is now enclosed in a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that might occur during file reading. This prevents the program from crashing if the file doesn't exist or is inaccessible.
2. **Dynamic Sizing with ArrayList:** Instead of a fixed-size array, it uses an `ArrayList` to store the lines.  `ArrayList` grows dynamically as you add elements, making it more efficient and flexible.
3. **Converting to Array (If Necessary):**  If you absolutely need a String array at the end, the code shows how to convert the `ArrayList` to a `String[]` using `lines.toArray(new String[0])`.
4. **Clearer Output:** The `Arrays.toString()` method is used to print the contents of the array in a readable format.
5. **Resource Management (try-with-resources):** The `BufferedReader` is declared within a `try-with-resources` block.  This ensures that the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed even if exceptions occur, preventing resource leaks.
6. **Comments:**  Comments have been added to explain the code.

**How to Use:**

1. **Create a text file:** Create a text file named `your_file.txt` (or whatever name you choose in the code).
2. **Add text:** Put the text you want to store in the file, with each line on a separate line.
3. **Compile and run:** Save the Java code as `FileToArray.java` and compile it using a Java compiler (like `javac FileToArray.java`). Then, run the compiled class file (`java FileToArray`).
4. **Output:** The program will print the contents of the file, with each line as a separate element in the array.



This improved version is more robust, efficient, and follows best practices for Java file handling.
