**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that might occur during file reading. This prevents the program from crashing and provides a more user-friendly experience.

2. **Resource Management (try-with-resources):**  The `BufferedReader` is now used within a `try-with-resources` statement.  This ensures that the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed even if exceptions occur, preventing resource leaks.

3. **Dynamic Array (ArrayList):** The code uses an `ArrayList` to store the lines initially.  An `ArrayList` is a dynamic array that grows as needed, so you don't have to know the number of lines in the file beforehand.

4. **Conversion to Array (if needed):**  If you absolutely need a fixed-size `String` array (e.g., for some specific API), the code shows how to convert the `ArrayList` to a `String` array using `lines.toArray(new String[0])`.  However, using an `ArrayList` directly is often more flexible and efficient.

5. **Clearer Method for Reading:** The file reading logic is encapsulated within the `readLinesFromFile` method, making the `main` method more concise and readable.

6. **Comments:** Added comments to explain important parts of the code.

7. **File Path:** The file path is now a variable, making it easy to change. Remember to replace `"your_file.txt"` with the actual path to your file.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StoreFileContentInArray.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:
   ```bash
   javac StoreFileContentInArray.java 
   ```
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program using:
   ```bash
   java StoreFileContentInArray
   ```


Make sure the file "your_file.txt" is in the same directory where you are running the compiled Java code, or provide the full path to the file.
