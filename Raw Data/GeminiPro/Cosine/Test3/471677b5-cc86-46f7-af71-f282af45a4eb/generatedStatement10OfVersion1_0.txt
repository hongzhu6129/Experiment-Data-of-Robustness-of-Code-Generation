**5.  Integer at the limit of int (corner case):**

* **Input:** Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647)
* **Expected Output:** (Note: might overflow, resulting in incorrect values. The program should still execute without crashing).


**6.  Integer at the limit of int (corner case, negative):**

* **Input:** Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648)
* **Expected Output:** (Note: might overflow, resulting in incorrect values.  The program should still execute without crashing).


**7. Invalid Input (corner case):**

* **Input:**  abc, 1.5, 2/3  (or any non-integer input)
* **Expected Output:**  The program should prompt the user again for valid integer input and should not crash.



These test cases cover various scenarios, including positive, negative, zero, large numbers, and boundary conditions (Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE) as well as handling incorrect input,  which helps ensure the correctness and robustness of the program.  It's crucial to test with both valid and invalid inputs to identify potential issues and improve the program's reliability.
