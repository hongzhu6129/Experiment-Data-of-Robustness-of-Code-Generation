            // Writing to the file

            writer.write("This is the second line.\n");

            System.out.println("File written successfully!");

            // Reading from the file
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath));
            String line;
            System.out.println("\nFile contents:");
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            reader.close();

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```


Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer error handling:**  The `try-catch` block catches `IOException` which is the appropriate exception type for file operations. The error message is also more informative.
* **Resource management:** The `writer` and `reader` are closed in `finally` blocks, ensuring resources are released even if errors occur.  This prevents resource leaks.  Even better, this version now uses try-with-resources, which automatically closes the resources.
* **Informative output:** The code now prints messages indicating success or failure and clearly displays the file contents.
* **File path variable:** The file path is stored in a variable making it easier to change.


This revised code provides a more robust and user-friendly solution for writing and reading text files in Java.
