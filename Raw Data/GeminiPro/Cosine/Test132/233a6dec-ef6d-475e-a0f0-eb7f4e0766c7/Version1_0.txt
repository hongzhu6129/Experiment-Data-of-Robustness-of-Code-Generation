```java
public class ApproximatePi {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double piApproximation1 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0/3.0) + (1.0/5.0) - (1.0/7.0) + (1.0/9.0) - (1.0/11.0));
        double piApproximation2 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0/3.0) + (1.0/5.0) - (1.0/7.0) + (1.0/9.0) - (1.0/11.0) + (1.0/13.0));

        System.out.println("Approximation 1 (up to 1/11): " + piApproximation1);
        System.out.println("Approximation 2 (up to 1/13): " + piApproximation2);
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Corrected Formula:** The original prompt had a slight error in the formula (an extra + sign).  The correct alternating signs (-, +, -, +...) are implemented now.

2. **Use of Doubles:** The code explicitly uses `1.0`, `3.0`, etc. to ensure floating-point division.  If you use integers like `1/3`, Java performs integer division, which truncates the decimal part and would lead to an incorrect result.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly labels each approximation for better understanding.


**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a file named `ApproximatePi.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the command:
   ```bash
   javac ApproximatePi.java 
   ```
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program with:
   ```bash
   java ApproximatePi
   ```


You'll then see the two approximations of pi printed to the console.
