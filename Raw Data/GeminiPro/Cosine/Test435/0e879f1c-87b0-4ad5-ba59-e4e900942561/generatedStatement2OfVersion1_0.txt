Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Spiral Sort:** The `spiralSort` method is now much more robust.  It handles different string lengths by padding with spaces and then removing them after the spiral traversal. This makes the spiral logic cleaner.
* **Matrix Simulation:**  The use of a `char[][]` matrix provides a clear structure for the spiral traversal.
* **Spiral Traversal Logic:**  The `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `dir` variables control the spiral traversal cleanly and efficiently.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now handles empty or single-element lists correctly.
* **Comments:** Added comments to clarify the code.
* **Ascending Sort (Streams):** The ascending sort efficiently uses streams for sorting.
* **Output:**  The output now clearly labels "Ascending" and "Spiral" results.


This improved version addresses the potential issues with different string lengths and provides a more robust and understandable solution.
