This improved example provides:

1. **Two Cloning Methods:** Demonstrates cloning using both the constructor and the `addAll()` method.
2. **Clearer Output:**  Improved output formatting makes it easier to understand the results.
3. **Immutability Demonstration:** Shows that modifications to the clone don't affect the original TreeSet and explains the importance of using an iterator�s remove method when modifying elements during iteration.
4. **ConcurrentModificationException Handling & Explanation** Shows how attempts to modify the treeset while using a foreach loop cause a `ConcurrentModificationException` and how this can be avoided with an iterator.
