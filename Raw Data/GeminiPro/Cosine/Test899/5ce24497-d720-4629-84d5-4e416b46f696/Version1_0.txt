        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("First unique character of the above: " + index);

        str = "aabbccddeeffg"; // Example with a unique char later in the string
        index = first_Uniq_Char(str);
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("First unique character of the above: " + index);


        str = "loveleetcode"; // Example from LeetCode
        index = first_Uniq_Char(str);
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("First unique character of the above: " + index);
    }

    public static int first_Uniq_Char(String s) {
        int[] charCounts = new int[26]; // Assuming only lowercase English alphabet

        // Count the occurrences of each character
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            charCounts[c - 'a']++;
        }

        // Find the index of the first character with a count of 1
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (charCounts[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] == 1) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return -1; // Should not reach here based on the problem statement (at least one unique char)
    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles all lowercase English alphabet characters:** Uses an array of size 26 to store character counts efficiently.
2. **Clearer variable names:**  Uses `charCounts` instead of `freq` for better readability.
3. **Returns -1 for edge cases (though not strictly required by the problem):**  While the prompt states there will always be a unique character, including a return -1 makes the function more robust for potential variations of the problem (and common practice when searching).
4. **Added more test cases in `main`:** Shows the function working on different inputs, including one where the unique character appears later in the string and the LeetCode example "loveleetcode".
5. **Efficient two-pass approach:** The code first counts character frequencies and then finds the first unique character in a separate loop.  This is more efficient than nested loops.
6. **Comments:**  Explains the purpose of different code sections.
7. **Uses `toCharArray()`:** Converts the string to a character array for easier iteration.


This improved version addresses the original problem's requirements while providing a more robust, efficient, and readable solution.
