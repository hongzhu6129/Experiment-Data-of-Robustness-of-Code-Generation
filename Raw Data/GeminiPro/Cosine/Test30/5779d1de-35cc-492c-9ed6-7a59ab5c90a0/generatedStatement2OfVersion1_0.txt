**Test Cases:**

1. **Positive Side Length:**
   - Input: `5`
   - Expected Output: `64.95`

2. **Decimal Side Length:**
   - Input: `2.5`
   - Expected Output: `16.24`

3. **Zero Side Length (Corner Case):**
   - Input: `0`
   - Expected Output: `Error: Side length must be a positive value.`

4. **Negative Side Length (Corner Case):**
   - Input: `-3`
   - Expected Output: `Error: Side length must be a positive value.`

5. **Very Large Side Length:**
   - Input: `10000`
   - Expected Output: `259807621.14` (This tests for potential overflow issues, though `double` can handle very large numbers).

6. **Small Side Length:**
    - Input: `0.001`
    - Expected Output: `0.00` (or a very small value, demonstrating handling of small decimals)



**How to run the test cases:**

You can manually input these values when prompted by the program.  A more robust way to test would be to write unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit.  This allows for automated testing and more thorough validation.  Here's a simple example of how you could start writing a JUnit test (requires adding the JUnit library to your project):
