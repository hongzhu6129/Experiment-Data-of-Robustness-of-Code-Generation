The solution is to:

1. **Ensure valid input:**  If the input is coming from the user or a file, validate it to make sure it's a number before attempting the conversion.  Regular expressions or `try-catch` blocks (as shown in the corrected code) are useful.

2. **Handle exceptions:** Use a `try-catch` block around `Integer.parseInt()` to catch the `NumberFormatException` that occurs when the conversion fails.  Inside the `catch` block, you can handle the error gracefully (e.g., print an error message, use a default value, or exit the program).


The provided code demonstrates the correct way to implement bubble sort and how to handle potential input errors separately in the `main` method, so that `bubbleSort` itself only deals with integer arrays.
