**Explanation and Educational Breakdown:**

1. **Hamming Numbers:**  Hamming numbers (also called regular numbers or 5-smooth numbers) are positive integers whose prime factors are only 2, 3, or 5.

2. **Algorithm:**  The efficient algorithm used here relies on maintaining three indices (i2, i3, i5) and three "next" values (next2, next3, next5).
   - `i2`, `i3`, `i5` track which Hamming number we're multiplying by 2, 3, and 5, respectively.
   - `next2`, `next3`, `next5` store the next potential Hamming numbers generated by multiplying previous Hamming numbers by 2, 3, and 5.

3. **Initialization:**
   - The `hamming` array stores the first 20 Hamming numbers.
   - `hamming[0] = 1;` because 1 is the first Hamming number.
   - `next2 = 2; next3 = 3; next5 = 5;` initialize the next potential Hamming numbers.


4. **Iteration:** The `for` loop generates the next Hamming numbers.
   - `nextHamming = Math.min(next2, Math.min(next3, next5));` This line finds the smallest of the next candidates (next2, next3, next5). This smallest value is the next Hamming number.
   - `hamming[i] = nextHamming;` Stores the calculated Hamming number in the array.

5. **Updating Next Candidates:** The `if` statements update the next potential Hamming numbers.  If `nextHamming` is equal to `next2` (for example), it means a multiple of 2 was chosen as the next Hamming number.  So, we need to update `next2` by multiplying the next Hamming number in the sequence by 2.  The same logic applies to multiples of 3 and 5.


6. **Output:** Finally, the code prints the first 20 Hamming numbers stored in the `hamming` array.


**Key Improvements over simpler methods:** This method avoids redundant calculations and generates Hamming numbers in strictly increasing order, making it very efficient.  Simpler methods that just check divisibility by 2, 3, and 5 can be much slower for larger Hamming numbers.
