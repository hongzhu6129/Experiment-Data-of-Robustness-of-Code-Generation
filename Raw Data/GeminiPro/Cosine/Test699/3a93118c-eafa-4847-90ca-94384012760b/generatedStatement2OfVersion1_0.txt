Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic, especially the core Sieve steps.
* **Efficiency:** The outer loop now iterates only up to the square root of `n`, which is a significant optimization.
* **Correctness:** Ensures that the inner loop starts at `p*p` to avoid redundant marking of composites.
* **Readability:** Used more descriptive variable names (e.g., `primeCount`).
* **Output Formatting:** Added a newline at the end of the output for better presentation.
* **Example Usage:** Included a sample value for `n` in `main` to demonstrate how to use the `generatePrimes` method.


This revised code accurately implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and is more efficient and readable.
