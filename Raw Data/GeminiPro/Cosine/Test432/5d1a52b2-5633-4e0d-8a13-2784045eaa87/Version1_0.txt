Here's how it breaks down:

1. **Create a list of integers:**  We initialize a sample list. You can modify this with your own data.

2. **Stream the list (outer stream):**  `numbers.stream()` starts a stream of the numbers.

3. **FlatMapToInt (inner stream and comparison):**  `flatMapToInt` is crucial here. For each `n` in the outer stream:
   - We create another stream of `numbers`.
   - We filter this inner stream, keeping only `m` values where `n` is even and `m` is odd (`n % 2 == 0 && m % 2 != 0`).
   - `Integer.compare(n, m)` compares `n` and `m`.  It returns 1 if `n > m`, 0 if `n == m`, and -1 if `n < m`. This effectively gives us 1 for every case where the even number is greater than the odd number.
   - `flatMapToInt` flattens the resulting stream of comparison results (1s, 0s, and -1s) into a single `IntStream`.

4. **Sum:**  `sum()` adds up all the comparison results in the `IntStream`. Because we only mapped to 1 when `n > m`, the sum directly represents the number of times an even number was greater than an odd number.

5. **Concise Approach:**  The second example provides a more concise and arguably clearer way to achieve the same using `filter` and `count`. It directly counts how many odd numbers are smaller than each even number and then sums those counts.
