This revised code provides a more comprehensive educational example by:

1. **Clearer Explanations:** Includes comments that explain the purpose of each step.
2. **Example with Strings:** Demonstrates that `TreeSet` can be used with other data types like `String`.
3. **Handling Edge Cases:** Shows what happens when the element is already present in the TreeSet and when the search element is greater than all elements in the TreeSet.
4. **Improved Output:** Provides more informative output messages, especially when no greater or equal element is found.  It also clearly distinguishes string outputs by using quotes.
