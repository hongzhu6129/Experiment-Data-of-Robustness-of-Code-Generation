Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature:**  The method signature `Saddleback(int[][], int, int, int)` is now well-defined.  It takes the matrix, the target value, the number of rows (m), and the number of columns (n) as input.

2. **Returns an Array:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` of size 2.  The array contains the row and column index of the target if found. If not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.  This makes it easy for the `main` method to check if the target was found.

3. **Saddleback Search Algorithm:**  The core logic implements the saddleback search (also sometimes called the staircase search) correctly.  It starts at the top-right corner and efficiently eliminates either a row or a column in each step.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method now demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` method with a sample matrix and target value. It also handles the case where the target is not found.

5. **Comments and Readability:**  Comments have been added to explain the code's logic and make it easier to understand.  Variable names are descriptive (e.g., `m` for rows, `n` for columns).


This revised code provides a robust and efficient solution for searching a sorted 2D matrix using the saddleback search technique.
