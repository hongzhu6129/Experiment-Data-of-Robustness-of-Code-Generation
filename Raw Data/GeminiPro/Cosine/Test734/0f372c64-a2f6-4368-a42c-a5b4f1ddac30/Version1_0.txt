Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Used `m` and `n` for matrix dimensions, `target` for the number to search, and `result` for the returned position.

2. **Initialized Result:** The `result` array is initialized to `{-1, -1}` to indicate "not found" by default.  This handles the case where the target isn't present cleanly.

3. **Saddleback Search Logic:** The core logic of the `Saddleback` method now correctly implements the saddleback search algorithm:
   - Start at the top-right corner (`row = 0`, `col = n - 1`).
   - If the current element is equal to the target, return its position.
   - If the current element is smaller than the target, move down to the next row (`row++`).
   - If the current element is larger than the target, move left to the previous column (`col--`).

4. **Boundary Checks:** The `while` loop condition (`row < m && col >= 0`) prevents going out of the matrix bounds.


5. **Example Usage and Output in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` method and prints clear output, including handling the case where the target is not found.  Added a second test case to illustrate this.



This improved version is efficient (O(m + n) time complexity), clear, and correctly handles edge cases.
