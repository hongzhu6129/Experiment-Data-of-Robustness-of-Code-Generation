Key improvements in this revised code:

1. **Error Handling:** Includes checks for the correct number of command-line arguments and handles `FileNotFoundException` gracefully.
2. **Filtering for words starting with a letter:** Uses `Character.isLetter()` to ensure only words that begin with a letter are added to the list.
3. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Uses more descriptive variable names like `filename` and `words`.
4. **Uses `ArrayList`:**  Uses `ArrayList` for dynamic sizing, which is more efficient for an unknown number of words.
5. **`Collections.reverseOrder()`:**  Uses the built-in `Collections.reverseOrder()` comparator for simpler and more efficient descending sorting.
6. **Adheres to method signature requirements:** Uses only the specified `main` and `display` methods.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DisplayWordsDescending.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:
