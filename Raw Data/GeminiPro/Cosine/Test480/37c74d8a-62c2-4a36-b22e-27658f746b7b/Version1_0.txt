```java
import java.time.ZoneId;
import java.util.Set;

public class TimeZones {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<String> allZoneIds = ZoneId.availableZoneIds();

        System.out.println("Available Time Zones (including UTC and GMT):");
        for (String zoneId : allZoneIds) {
            if (zoneId.contains("UTC") || zoneId.contains("GMT")) {  // Filter for UTC and GMT
                System.out.println(zoneId);
            }
        }


        // Demonstrating how to specifically get UTC and GMT (if filtering is not preferred)
        System.out.println("\nSpecifically getting UTC and GMT:");
        System.out.println("UTC: " + ZoneId.get("UTC")); // or ZoneId.UTC
        System.out.println("GMT: " + ZoneId.get("GMT")); // or ZoneId.GMT


        // Showing how "GMT" zones are actually "Etc/GMT" with offsets.
        System.out.println("\nEtc/GMT zones:");
        for(String zoneId : allZoneIds) {
            if(zoneId.startsWith("Etc/GMT")) {
                System.out.println(zoneId);
            }

        }

    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Filtering for UTC and GMT:** The code now directly filters the available zone IDs to display only those containing "UTC" or "GMT" in their names, fulfilling the prompt's requirement more accurately.

2. **Direct Access to UTC and GMT:** Demonstrates how to directly obtain `ZoneId` objects for UTC and GMT without iterating through all zones.  This clarifies the difference between displaying all available zone *names* versus getting specific, well-defined `ZoneId`s.  (Note: `ZoneId.UTC` and `ZoneId.GMT` are equivalent to `ZoneId.get("UTC")` and `ZoneId.get("GMT")` respectively, but the latter method is generally preferred if you are working with a String representation of a zone ID.)

3. **Clarification on "GMT" Zones:**  The output and added explanation now show that "GMT" zones are represented using the "Etc/GMT" prefix followed by an offset. This helps understanding why a simple "GMT" lookup returns a specific zone (GMT0) while there are many related "Etc/GMT" entries.

4. **Clearer Output and Comments:** Improved comments and output formatting make the code more readable and easier to understand.



This revised version addresses the original prompt's requirements more directly and provides additional context regarding UTC, GMT, and their representation in Java's `ZoneId` system.
