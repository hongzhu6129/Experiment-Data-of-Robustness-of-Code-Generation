Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Filtering for UTC and GMT:** The code now directly filters the available zone IDs to display only those containing "UTC" or "GMT" in their names, fulfilling the prompt's requirement more accurately.

2. **Direct Access to UTC and GMT:** Demonstrates how to directly obtain `ZoneId` objects for UTC and GMT without iterating through all zones.  This clarifies the difference between displaying all available zone *names* versus getting specific, well-defined `ZoneId`s.  (Note: `ZoneId.UTC` and `ZoneId.GMT` are equivalent to `ZoneId.get("UTC")` and `ZoneId.get("GMT")` respectively, but the latter method is generally preferred if you are working with a String representation of a zone ID.)

3. **Clarification on "GMT" Zones:**  The output and added explanation now show that "GMT" zones are represented using the "Etc/GMT" prefix followed by an offset. This helps understanding why a simple "GMT" lookup returns a specific zone (GMT0) while there are many related "Etc/GMT" entries.

4. **Clearer Output and Comments:** Improved comments and output formatting make the code more readable and easier to understand.



This revised version addresses the original prompt's requirements more directly and provides additional context regarding UTC, GMT, and their representation in Java's `ZoneId` system.
