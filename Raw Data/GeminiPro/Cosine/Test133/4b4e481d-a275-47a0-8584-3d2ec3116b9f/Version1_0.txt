**Test cases with corner cases**

* **Empty string**
```java
Input: ""
Character to replace: 'a'
Character to replace with: 'b'

Output: ""
```

* **String with no character to replace**
```java
Input: "abcdef"
Character to replace: 'z'
Character to replace with: 'y'

Output: "abcdef"
```

* **String with multiple occurrences of the character to replace**
```java
Input: "abcabc"
Character to replace: 'a'
Character to replace with: 'b'

Output: "bbbbbc"
```

* **String with the character to replace at the beginning**
```java
Input: "abcdef"
Character to replace: 'a'
Character to replace with: 'b'

Output: "bbcdef"
```

* **String with the character to replace at the end**
```java
Input: "abcdef"
Character to replace: 'f'
Character to replace with: 'g'

Output: "abcdeg"
```

* **String with the character to replace in the middle**
```java
Input: "abcdef"
Character to replace: 'c'
Character to replace with: 'd'

Output: "abdef"
```
