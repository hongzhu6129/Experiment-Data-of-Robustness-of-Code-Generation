**Problem:**

Design a Java program that takes an input and calculates how many years it would take to earn $100,000 if three positions with the same series are opened.

**Interactive Word Used:**

* java

**Test Cases:**

**Corner Cases:**

* **Input is negative:**
```java
int input = -100000;
```

* **Input is 0:**
```java
int input = 0;
```

**Standard Cases:**

* **Input is a small positive value:**
```java
int input = 1000;
```

* **Input is a large positive value:**
```java
int input = 99999;
```

* **Input is a decimal value:**
```java
double input = 100000.50;
```

* **Input is a fractional value:**
```java
double input = 100000.25;
```

**Expected Output:**

For each test case, the program should calculate and print the number of years it will take to earn $100,000 given the input. Example output for some test cases:

* **Input:** -100000
* **Output:** Input must be a positive value.

* **Input:** 0
* **Output:** Input must be a positive value.

* **Input:** 1000
* **Output:** It will take 1000 years to earn $100,000.

* **Input:** 99999
* **Output:** It will take 1 year to earn $100,000.

* **Input:** 100000.50
* **Output:** It will take 1 year to earn $100,000.

* **Input:** 100000.25
* **Output:** It will take 1 year to earn $100,000.
