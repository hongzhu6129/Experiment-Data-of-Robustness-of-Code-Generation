        if (n < 0 || k < 0) {
            System.out.println("Error: n and k must be non-negative integers.");
        } else {
            long coefficient = binomial_Coefficient(n, k);
            System.out.println("The binomial coefficient C(" + n + ", " + k + ") is: " + coefficient);

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes input validation to check if `n` and `k` are non-negative.  It prints an error message if they are negative.

2. **Efficiency:** The  `if (k > n / 2)`  condition optimizes the calculation.  The binomial coefficient C(n, k) is equal to C(n, n-k).  By ensuring that `k` is always the smaller of the two, we reduce the number of iterations in the loop.

3. **Clarity and Readability:** Comments have been added to explain the logic and the purpose of the optimization.  Variable names are more descriptive (`result` instead of just `res`).

4. **User Input:**  The `main` method now uses a `Scanner` to get input from the user, making the program interactive.

5. **Integer Overflow Handling (Important):**  The multiplication within the loop is performed carefully to avoid integer overflow as much as possible.  By multiplying by `(n - i + 1)` before dividing by `i`, we ensure we're always dividing by the smallest possible value, reducing the risk of exceeding the limits of `long`.  However, for very large `n` and `k`, `long` could still overflow.  If truly massive numbers are required, consider using `BigInteger`.


Example Usage:

```
Enter the value of n (positive integer): 5
Enter the value of k (positive integer): 2
The binomial coefficient C(5, 2) is: 10
```
