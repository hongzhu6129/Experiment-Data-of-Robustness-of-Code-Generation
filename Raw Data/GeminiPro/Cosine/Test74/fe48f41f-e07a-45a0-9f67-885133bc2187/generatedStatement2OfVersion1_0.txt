This improved version:

1. **Handles Command-Line Arguments:** It checks if two command-line arguments are provided. If so, it attempts to convert them to integers and calculate their sum. This makes the program more flexible, allowing users to input numbers when running the program.

2. **Error Handling:** It includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the command-line arguments are not valid integers.  This prevents the program from crashing.

3. **Clearer Output:**  The output messages are more descriptive, indicating whether the sum is calculated from hardcoded values or command-line arguments.

**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SumOfTwoNumbers.java`.

2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac SumOfTwoNumbers.java`

3. **Run (without arguments):**  `java SumOfTwoNumbers` (This will use the hardcoded values 10 and 20).

4. **Run (with arguments):**  `java SumOfTwoNumbers 5 15` (This will use 5 and 15 as input).
