Key improvements:

* **Regular Expressions:** Uses `Pattern` and `Matcher` for efficient and flexible number extraction.  The `\\d+` pattern matches one or more digits, handling cases where numbers have more than one digit.
* **Error Handling (Implicit):** `Integer.parseInt()` will throw a `NumberFormatException` if a non-numeric string is encountered.  This code doesn't explicitly handle it, but it's important to be aware of this possibility in a production environment (you might add a `try-catch` block).
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `inputString` is more descriptive than `str`.
* **More Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method now tests several different scenarios, including strings with no numbers, multi-digit numbers, numbers interspersed with other characters, and spaces around numbers.  This helps ensure the code works correctly in a variety of situations.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the purpose of the code and the test cases.
