```java
public class Ramanujan {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1729; // Example upper limit (Ramanujan's number)

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int a = 1; a * a * a < i; a++) {
                for (int b = a + 1; a * a * a + b * b * b <= i; b++) { // b starts from a+1 to avoid duplicates and ensure distinct pairs
                    if (a * a * a + b * b * b == i) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }

            if (count >= 2) { // Check if the number is the sum of two cubes in at least two different ways
                System.out.println(i + " can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in " + count + " different ways.");


                // Print the pairs for demonstration:
                System.out.print("Pairs: ");
                for (int a = 1; a * a * a < i; a++) {
                    for (int b = a + 1; a * a * a + b * b * b <= i; b++) {
                        if (a * a * a + b * b * b == i) {
                           System.out.print("(" + a + "," + b + ") ");
                        }
                    }
                }
                System.out.println(); // Newline after printing pairs
                return; // Exit after finding the first such number

            }

        }

    }
}
```


Key improvements:

* **Efficiency:** The inner loop now starts from `a + 1`. This avoids redundant calculations (e.g., 1� + 2� and 2� + 1� are the same) and ensures that we only count distinct pairs of cubes.
* **Clarity:** Added comments explaining the logic and purpose of the loops.
* **Demonstration:** The code now prints the pairs of cubes that sum to the found number.
* **Early Exit:** The `return` statement after finding the first such number makes the code more efficient. If you want to find *all* such numbers up to `n`, remove the `return` statement.
* **Correctness:**  Addresses the original problem statement accurately by checking for *at least two* distinct pairs.



Example Output (with n = 1729):

```
1729 can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in 2 different ways.
Pairs: (1,12) (9,10) 
```
