To compile and run this:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `LeapYear.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:  `javac LeapYear.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with the year as a command-line argument:  `java LeapYear 2024`  (Replace 2024 with the year you want to check).


Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:**  The code now includes error handling for invalid input (non-integer values) and missing or extra command-line arguments using a `try-catch` block. This makes the program more robust.
* **Clear Usage Instructions:** It provides clear instructions on how to run the program if the user provides incorrect input.
* **Concise Leap Year Logic:** The leap year calculation is more compact and readable.
* **Command-Line Argument Input:**  Gets the year input from the command line, making it more flexible.
