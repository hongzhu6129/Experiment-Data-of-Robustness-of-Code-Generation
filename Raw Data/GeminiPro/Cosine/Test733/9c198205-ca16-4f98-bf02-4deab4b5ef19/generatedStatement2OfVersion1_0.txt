Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `left` and `right` instead of `l` and `r` improves readability.

2. **Correct Midpoint Calculation:** The midpoint calculations `mid1` and `mid2` are now calculated correctly to divide the search space into thirds.

3. **Handles Edge Cases:** The `right >= left` condition prevents potential infinite recursion if the target is not present and the initial bounds are incorrect.


4. **Returns -1 when not found:** Returns -1 to explicitly indicate that the element was not found.  This is standard practice for search algorithms.

5. **Added Test Cases in main:** Includes examples in `main` to demonstrate both successful and unsuccessful searches, which helps verify the correctness of the `ternary_search` method.

6. **Comments and Explanations:** The code includes comments to explain the logic and key steps, which greatly improves understanding.
