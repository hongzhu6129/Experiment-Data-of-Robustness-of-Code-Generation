Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles Edge Cases:**  Correctly manages null or empty strings.  Also handles leading/trailing spaces so that they don't create spurious empty words in the reversed output.
* **Efficiency:** Uses `StringBuilder` for string manipulation, which is more efficient than repeated string concatenation.
* **Clarity:** Comments explain the logic.
* **Correct Word Reversal:** Now correctly reverses the characters within each individual word, which was the core requirement of the problem and was missing in the previous response.  The original reversed the *order* of the words but not the words themselves.
* **Adheres to Prompt:**  Strictly uses the specified method signatures.


This improved version provides a complete and correct solution to the problem while adhering to the method signature constraints in the prompt.
