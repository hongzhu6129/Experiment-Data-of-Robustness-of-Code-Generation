**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The `polyEval` method implements Horner's method (also known as Horner's rule or Horner's scheme).  This is the efficient way to evaluate polynomials as described in the prompt.  It minimizes the number of multiplications required.

2. **Clearer Coefficient Handling:**  The coefficients are stored in a `List<Double>`. This makes it easy to handle polynomials of any degree. The example in `main` demonstrates how to set up the coefficients.

3. **Reverse Iteration:** The `polyEval` method iterates through the coefficients from the highest power of x down to the constant term.  This is crucial for Horner's method to work correctly.

4. **Concise and Readable:** The code is now much more concise and easier to understand. The logic within `polyEval` directly reflects the nested multiplication and addition described in the problem.

5. **Correctness:** This implementation will produce the correct result (124.0 in the given example) and is generalizable to other polynomials and values of x.
