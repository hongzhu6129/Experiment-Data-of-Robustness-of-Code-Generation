Explanation:

1. **Method 1:  Convert StringBuffer to String:**
   - `strBuf.toString()` converts the `StringBuffer` object to a `String` object.
   - `str1.equals(str2)` compares the two `String` objects for equality using the `equals()` method. This is a common and straightforward approach.

2. **Method 2: Using `contentEquals()`:**
   - `str1.contentEquals(strBuf)` is a more efficient way to compare a `String` directly with a `StringBuffer` (or other `CharSequence` types).  It avoids the overhead of creating a new `String` object from the `StringBuffer`.  This is generally the preferred method when comparing `String` with `StringBuffer`.


Important Note about `==` :

Don't use `==` to compare the *contents* of strings in Java.  `==` checks for reference equality (whether the two variables refer to the same object in memory).  For string comparisons, always use `equals()` (for two `String` objects) or `contentEquals()` (for `String` compared to `StringBuffer`/`CharSequence`).
