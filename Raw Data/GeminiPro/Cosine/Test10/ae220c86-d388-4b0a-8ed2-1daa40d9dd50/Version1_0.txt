```java
public class FacePrinter {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printFace();
    }

    public static void printFace() {
        System.out.println("  xxxxxxx");
        System.out.println(" x       x");
        System.out.println("x  o   o x");
        System.out.println("x   <   x");
        System.out.println(" x  --- x");
        System.out.println("  xxxxxxx");
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

While this program doesn't take any input, we can still think about "testing" in terms of verifying its output.  Since it's just printing a fixed face, the core test is to ensure the output is exactly as expected.  There aren't true "corner cases" in the traditional sense (like invalid inputs) because there *are* no inputs.

However, we can think broader:

1. **Correct Output:** Run the program and visually inspect the output to confirm it matches the intended "face" design.  Copy and paste the expected output into a text file and compare it with the program's output using a diff tool or by visually checking.  This is the primary test.

2. **Character Encoding:**  While unlikely to be a problem with modern Java, you *could* test with different character encodings (e.g., UTF-8, UTF-16) on different platforms to be absolutely sure the characters are displayed consistently.  This is less of a concern if you stick to basic ASCII characters like in the given program.

3. **Output Redirection:**  Test redirecting the output to a file. This checks that the program writes correctly to a different output stream.  You can do this from the command line (e.g., `java FacePrinter > output.txt`).  Then, compare the contents of `output.txt` to the expected output.

4. **Integration (if applicable):**  If this face printing were part of a larger application, you would have integration tests to make sure that the `printFace()` method is called at the appropriate time and in the correct context within the larger program's logic.


**Example of automated testing (using JUnit):**

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class FacePrinterTest {

    @Test
    public void testPrintFace() {
        ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        System.setOut(new PrintStream(outputStream));

        FacePrinter.printFace();

        String expectedOutput = "  xxxxxxx\n" +
                                " x       x\n" +
                                "x  o   o x\n" +
                                "x   <   x\n" +
                                " x  --- x\n" +
                                "  xxxxxxx\n";
        assertEquals(expectedOutput, outputStream.toString());

        // Restore System.out (important for other tests)
        System.setOut(System.out); 
    }
}
```

This JUnit test captures the output of `printFace()` and compares it to the expected string. This makes testing more robust and automatable.  You would need a JUnit library (like JUnit 5) on your classpath to run this test.
