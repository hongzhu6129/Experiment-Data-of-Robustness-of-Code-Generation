3. **Character Encoding (Corner Case):**  Ensure the program handles different character encodings correctly. This is less likely to be an issue with simple ASCII characters but could become important if you were to use more complex characters like emojis.  Set your system's character encoding (e.g., UTF-8) and run the program.

4. **Console Output Issues (Corner Case):**  If the console or terminal the program runs in doesn't support certain characters or has display issues, the face might not render correctly.  Test on different terminals or console environments if necessary (e.g., Command Prompt vs. PowerShell on Windows).

5. **No Input (Corner Case):**  This program doesn't take any input, but it's still good practice to consider what would happen if unexpected arguments were passed. In this case, the program should ignore them and print the face as usual. Try running it with some arbitrary command-line arguments: `java FacePrinter some arguments here`.


**Automated Testing (JUnit example - more robust):**

For more robust testing, use a testing framework like JUnit.  This allows for automated test execution and comparison of actual vs. expected output.
