**Test Cases (While you can't directly "test" the output visually in a unit test framework, you can verify that the expected strings are printed):**

1. **Standard Case:** (This is primarily what the `main` method does already)  Verify that the `printFace()` method produces the expected face output.  You can achieve this through system output capturing in a testing framework (like JUnit with System.setOut()).

2. **Empty Input/No Input:** (Not applicable here, as the function doesn't take any input).  This case becomes relevant if you were to modify the face based on parameters.  For instance, you might make the face smile or frown based on a boolean input.

3. **Modified Face Features (if applicable):** If your function were designed to change features (like adding a smile, changing eye shape, etc.), you would test those variations. Example (if there were a `printSmilingFace()` method):
