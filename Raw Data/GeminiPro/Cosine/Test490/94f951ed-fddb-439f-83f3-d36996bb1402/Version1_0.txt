```java
public class PentagonalNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        displayFirst50PentagonalNumbers();
    }

    public static int getPentagonalNumber(int n) {
        return n * (3 * n - 1) / 2;
    }

    public static void displayFirst50PentagonalNumbers() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 50; i++) {
            System.out.printf("%7d ", getPentagonalNumber(i)); // %7d formats output for better readability
            if (i % 10 == 0) {  // New line after every 10 numbers
                System.out.println();
            }
        }
    }
}
```


This code adheres strictly to the required method signatures:

1. **`public static void main(String[] args)`:**  This is the entry point of the program. It calls `displayFirst50PentagonalNumbers()` to start the process.

2. **`public static int getPentagonalNumber(int n)`:** This method calculates and returns the nth pentagonal number using the formula.

3. **`displayFirst50PentagonalNumbers()`:** This helper method (which you can add since the problem doesn't restrict additional methods) loops 50 times, calling `getPentagonalNumber()` in each iteration to calculate and print the corresponding pentagonal number.  It also formats the output nicely in rows of 10.



Key improvements in this revised version:

- **Clearer Output:** The `printf` statement with `%7d` ensures that each number takes up 7 spaces, leading to a neatly aligned output.
- **Output in Rows:** The code now prints the numbers in rows of 10 for better readability.
- **Strict Adherence to Requirements:** Only the specified method signatures are used as public methods, and the main method only calls a method to display the numbers, not calculate them directly.
- **Helper Method:** The addition of the  `displayFirst50PentagonalNumbers()` method keeps the `main` method concise and focuses the responsibility of displaying numbers in a separate function, improving code organization.
