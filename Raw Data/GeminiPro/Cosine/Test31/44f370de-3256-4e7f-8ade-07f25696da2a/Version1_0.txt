```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class EarthDistance {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Input the latitude of coordinate 1: ");
        double lat1 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());  // Convert to radians

        System.out.print("Input the longitude of coordinate 1: ");
        double lon1 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble()); // Convert to radians

        System.out.print("Input the latitude of coordinate 2: ");
        double lat2 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble()); // Convert to radians

        System.out.print("Input the longitude of coordinate 2: ");
        double lon2 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble()); // Convert to radians

        double radius = 6371.01; // Earth's radius in kilometers

        double distance = radius * Math.acos(Math.sin(lat1) * Math.sin(lat2) + Math.cos(lat1) * Math.cos(lat2) * Math.cos(lon1 - lon2));

        System.out.println("The distance between those points is: " + distance);
        input.close();
    }
}

**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -70
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90   (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: -90  (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0    (Longitude doesn't matter at poles)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

4. **Antipodes (Opposite sides of the Earth):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 110  (180 degrees opposite longitude)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

5. **Points near the International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Distance: ~222.64 km (small distance because they are close despite the longitude difference)


6. **Points at the equator with 90 degrees longitude difference:**
    - lat1: 0
    - lon1: 0
    - lat2: 0
    - lon2: 90
    - Expected Distance: ~10007.54 (approximately Earth's circumference/4)



7. **Invalid Input:**
   - lat1: "abc" (or any non-numeric input)  
   - The program should handle this gracefully and either exit with an error message or prompt the user to re-enter valid input.  Use a `try-catch` block around your `input.nextDouble()` calls to catch `InputMismatchException`.




**How to Run the Tests:**

You can manually enter these values into your program to verify the results.  For more automated testing, consider using a Java testing framework like JUnit.  With JUnit, you could write test methods that call a function that calculates the distance and then use `assertEquals()` to check if the calculated distance matches the expected distance within a certain tolerance (due to floating-point precision). Example of JUnit Test (you would put more test cases in this class):



```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class EarthDistanceTest {

    @Test
    void testSamePoint() {
        double distance = EarthDistance.calculateDistance(40, -70, 40, -70);  // Assuming you create a calculateDistance method
        assertEquals(0.0, distance, 0.001); // Delta for tolerance
    }

     // ... more test methods here
}
```


This organized approach to testing ensures your program works correctly in different situations, including edge cases, and makes it easier to identify and fix bugs.
