```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class EarthDistance {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Input the latitude of coordinate 1: ");
        double lat1 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());

        System.out.print("Input the longitude of coordinate 1: ");
        double lon1 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());

        System.out.print("Input the latitude of coordinate 2: ");
        double lat2 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());

        System.out.print("Input the longitude of coordinate 2: ");
        double lon2 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());

        double earthRadius = 6371.01; // Earth's radius in kilometers

        double distance = earthRadius * Math.acos(Math.sin(lat1) * Math.sin(lat2) +
                Math.cos(lat1) * Math.cos(lat2) * Math.cos(lon1 - lon2));

        System.out.println("The distance between those points is: " + distance);
        input.close();
    }
}



```

**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -74
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

3. **North & South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0 
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0  (Longitude doesn't matter at the poles)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

4. **Antipodes (Opposite sides of Earth):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74 (New York)
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 106 (Near Perth, Australia � roughly antipodal to New York)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 / 2 =  ~10007.54  km (halfway around the world)

5. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 90
   - Expected Distance: ~10007.54 km (quarter way around the Earth)




6. **Points near the International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 10
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 10
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Distance: Small distance (because they are close despite the large longitude difference)



7. **Invalid Input (optional):**
   - lat1: 100 (latitude out of range -90 to 90 )
   - lon1: 200 (longitude out of range -180 to 180)
   -  Your code should ideally handle these gracefully (e.g., throw an exception, print an error message).


**How to Test:**

You can modify the `main` method of the Java program to hardcode these test cases or use a testing framework like JUnit to automate the tests. JUnit would provide a more structured way to define and run your test cases, assert expected outcomes, and handle potential exceptions.


```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class EarthDistanceTest {

    @Test
    void testSamePoint() {
        double distance = EarthDistance.calculateDistance(40, -74, 40, -74);
        assertEquals(0, distance, 0.001); // Delta allows for minor floating-point differences
    }


    // ... (Add more test cases similarly using the calculateDistance method) ...
}
```

Refactor your EarthDistance class slightly to have a `calculateDistance()` method which can be reused in your tests:

```java
 public class EarthDistance {
        public static double calculateDistance(double lat1, double lon1, double lat2, double lon2) {
            double earthRadius = 6371.01;
            lat1 = Math.toRadians(lat1);
            lon1 = Math.toRadians(lon1);
            lat2 = Math.toRadians(lat2);
            lon2 = Math.toRadians(lon2);
            return earthRadius * Math.acos(Math.sin(lat1) * Math.sin(lat2) +
                    Math.cos(lat1) * Math.cos(lat2) * Math.cos(lon1 - lon2));

        }
        // ... (rest of your code)
}

```


This is a much more robust way to ensure your code works correctly across various scenarios.  Remember to include tests for boundary conditions and edge cases.
