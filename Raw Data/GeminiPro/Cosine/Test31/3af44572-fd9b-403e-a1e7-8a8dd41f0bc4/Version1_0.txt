        System.out.print("Input the longitude of coordinate 1: ");

**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -70
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

3. **Antipodal Points (opposite sides of the Earth):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 110 
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's diameter)


4. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0  (Longitude doesn't matter at poles)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km

5. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 90
   - Expected Distance: ~10007.54 km (quarter of Earth's circumference)

6. **Points near the International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 10
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 10
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Distance: ~222.64 km  (small distance as they are close despite the longitude difference)


7. **Points with large longitude difference but close in latitude (near poles):**
    - lat1: 89
    - lon1: 0
    - lat2: 89
    - lon2: 180
    - Expected Distance: ~19.95 km (small distance due to proximity to the pole).


8. **Invalid Input:** You should also test how your code handles invalid inputs (e.g., latitudes outside -90 to +90, non-numeric inputs) and either throw an appropriate exception or handle it gracefully.  This could be part of separate unit tests if you were using a testing framework like JUnit.




To automate the testing process, create a separate test class (e.g., `EarthDistanceTest.java`) and use a testing framework like JUnit to define these test cases formally. JUnit provides assertions (like `assertEquals()`) to verify that the calculated distances match the expected values within a certain tolerance (due to floating-point approximations). This ensures the correctness of your `EarthDistance` class.
