**Explanation of Results and Integer Division:**

* **Integer Division:** In Java, when you divide two integers (like `-15 / 8`), the result is also an integer.  The fractional part is truncated (discarded). So, `-15 / 8` becomes `-1`.

* **Expression c:**  The original calculation `20 + -3 * 5 / 8` proceeds as follows:
   1. `-3 * 5 = -15`
   2. `-15 / 8 = -1` (integer division)
   3. `20 + -1 = 18`

* **Getting 18.125 (and rounding to 19 if needed):** To perform floating-point division and get the 18.125 result, you need to cast at least one of the operands in the division to a floating-point type (like `double`).  This forces the division to be performed with floating-point precision. You can then round to 19 if that's required by the problem.


**Key improvements in this code:**

* **Clearer Output:** The output now explicitly shows the expressions being evaluated, making it easier to understand the results.
* **Correctness:** The code correctly demonstrates both integer division (as in the original problem) and how to get the 18.125 (and potentially 19 after rounding) result using floating-point division.
* **Explanation of Integer Division:** The code includes a comment explaining the concept of integer division in Java, which is crucial to understanding the output of expression c.
