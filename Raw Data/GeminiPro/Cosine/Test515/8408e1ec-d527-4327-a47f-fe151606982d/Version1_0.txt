This code adheres strictly to the requested method signatures: `public static void main(String[])` and `public static boolean happy_num(long)`.

**Explanation:**

1. **`main` method:**
   - Initializes a `count` to keep track of how many happy numbers have been found.
   - Starts a `while` loop that continues until 10 happy numbers are found.
   - Calls `happy_num` to check if the current `num` is happy.
   - If `happy_num` returns `true`, prints the number and increments the `count`.
   - Increments `num` to check the next number.

2. **`happy_num` method:**
   - Uses a `HashSet` called `seen` to keep track of numbers encountered during the process.  This is crucial for detecting cycles (non-happy numbers).
   - Enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `num` is not 1 and `num` has not been seen before.
   - Inside the loop:
     - Adds the current `num` to the `seen` set.
     - Calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of `num`.
     - Updates `num` to the calculated sum.
   - After the loop, returns `true` if `num` is 1 (happy number), and `false` otherwise (unhappy number, stuck in a cycle).


This revised answer directly addresses the prompt's requirements by using only the specified method signatures and providing a clear and concise solution.
