Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`makefactorial(int n)`:** Calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. This is a helper function used in `calcuLexicoRank`.

2. **`calcuLexicoRank(String str, int n)`:** Calculates the lexicographic rank of the given string `str` of length `n`.
   - It initializes the rank to 1 (as the smallest lexicographically ranked string has rank 1).
   - It uses a `count` array to store the count of characters smaller than the current character.
   - The logic iterates through the string, and for each character:
     - It calculates the contribution of the characters smaller than the current character to the rank.
     - It updates the `count` array to reflect the characters already considered.

3. **`main(String[] args)`:** Contains example usage of the `calcuLexicoRank` function. I've added a couple more examples to demonstrate its functionality.

4. **ASCII Assumption:** The code assumes ASCII characters for simplicity.  For a fully general solution handling Unicode,  you'd need to use a different approach (e.g., a `HashMap` instead of the `count` array) or a library that provides character ordering information.

5. **Clarity and Comments:**  I've added comments to explain the logic within the `calcuLexicoRank` function.


This revised code provides a correct and more efficient solution to calculate the lexicographic rank of a string. It adheres to the requested method signatures and includes explanations to enhance understanding.
