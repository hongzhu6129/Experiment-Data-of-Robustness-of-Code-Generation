Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles empty arrays and `null` input.
* **Clearer variable names:**  `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive.
* **Concise logic:** The core logic is more streamlined and efficient.
* **Comprehensive `main` method:** Includes various test cases demonstrating correct functionality, including edge cases.
* **Output formatting:** Uses `Arrays.toString` and `Arrays.copyOfRange` to cleanly print the relevant portion of the modified array after duplicate removal. This prevents displaying the leftover elements from the original array which are no longer part of the "new" array.  It makes the output much easier to interpret.


This revised version addresses all the previous shortcomings and provides a robust, efficient, and easily understandable solution.
