Key improvements in this educational version:

- **Clearer Comments:**  More descriptive comments explain the logic and purpose of each step.
- **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes handling for empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays, making it more robust.
- **Educational Print Statements:**  Prints intermediate steps, including the current element, `uniqueIndex`, and the state of the array after each comparison. This visualization greatly helps in understanding how the algorithm works.
- **Multiple Examples:**  The `main` method demonstrates the function with different example arrays (including edge cases) to show its behavior in various scenarios.
- **Prints the Updated Array:** The `main` method now neatly prints the updated array (the portion containing the unique elements) using `Arrays.copyOfRange`. This provides a complete and easy-to-understand output.
