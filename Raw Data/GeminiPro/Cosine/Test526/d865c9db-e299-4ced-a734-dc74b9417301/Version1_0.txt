```java
public class FermatNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = 0;

        while (count < 10) {
            long fermatNumber = (long) (Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, n))) + 1;

            // Check for overflow (Fermat numbers grow very quickly)
            if (fermatNumber < 0) { 
                System.out.println("Overflow occurred. Cannot calculate further Fermat numbers.");
                break; // Stop if overflow happens
            }

            System.out.println(fermatNumber);
            n++;
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Overflow Handling:** Fermat numbers become extremely large very quickly.  The code now includes a check for overflow.  If `fermatNumber` becomes negative, it indicates that the calculation has exceeded the capacity of the `long` data type.  The program then prints a message and stops.

2. **`long` Data Type:**  Using `long` instead of `int` is essential. Even `long` will only be able to hold the first few Fermat numbers before overflow occurs.

3. **Clarity and Readability:** The code uses more descriptive variable names (`fermatNumber`, `count`, `n`) and includes comments to explain the logic.

4. **Loop Control:** The `while` loop continues until 10 Fermat numbers have been printed or until an overflow occurs.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FermatNumbers.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using the Java compiler:
   ```bash
   javac FermatNumbers.java
   ```
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program:
   ```bash
   java FermatNumbers
   ```


This improved version handles potential overflow, provides clearer code, and uses the correct data type to store the large values of Fermat numbers (to the extent possible).
