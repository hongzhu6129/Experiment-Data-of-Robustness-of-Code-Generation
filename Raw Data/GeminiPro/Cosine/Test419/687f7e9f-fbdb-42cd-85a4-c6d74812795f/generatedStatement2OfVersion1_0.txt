Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using more descriptive names like `intValue`, `longValue`, etc. improves readability.
* **Error Handling (try-catch):** The `try-catch` block handles potential `NumberFormatException` if the input string is not a valid number. This prevents the program from crashing.
* **Example with Decimal:** Added an example showing how to convert a string representing a decimal number to `double` and `float`.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain each conversion step.
* **"+6" Clarification:** I've interpreted "+6" to mean adding 6 to the integer representation of the string.  If you meant something else, please clarify, and I can adjust the code accordingly.





This improved version is more robust, user-friendly (with error handling), and easier to understand.  It also demonstrates handling both integer and decimal strings.
