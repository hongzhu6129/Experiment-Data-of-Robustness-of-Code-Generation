**Explanation:**

1. **Import `PriorityQueue`:** We import the `java.util.PriorityQueue` class to use priority queues.

2. **Create a `PriorityQueue`:**  `PriorityQueue<String> colorQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();` creates a new priority queue that will store strings.  Since we don't provide a comparator, it will use the *natural ordering* of strings, which is alphabetical order.

3. **Add elements:** We use `colorQueue.add()` to add string elements (representing colors) to the queue.

4. **Print elements (Method 1 - Enhanced For Loop):** The recommended approach is to use an enhanced `for` loop ( `for (String color : colorQueue)` )  This iterates over the elements *without removing them* from the queue.  This preserves the queue's contents.

5. **Print elements (Method 2 - Polling - Optional):** The commented-out section shows how to print elements using the `poll()` method.  `poll()` retrieves and *removes* the head (highest priority element) of the queue.  If you uncomment this section, you'll see the colors printed in alphabetical order, but the queue will be empty afterward.


**Output (using the enhanced for loop method):**
