**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Import `PriorityQueue`:** The `java.util.PriorityQueue` class is imported to use priority queue functionality.

2. **Create a `PriorityQueue`:** A `PriorityQueue` named `colorQueue` is created to store strings (colors in this case).  By default, a `PriorityQueue` orders elements in their natural order (for Strings, this is lexicographical/alphabetical order).

3. **Add Elements:** The `add()` method is used to insert colors into the queue.

4. **Print Elements (Non-Destructive):**
   - **Method 2 (Recommended):** A for-each loop is the simplest and clearest way to iterate through the elements *without removing them* from the queue. 
   - **Method 3:** `toString()` can also be used, but the output format is less readable (e.g., `[Blue, Green, Orange, Red, Yellow]`).


5. **Print Elements (Destructive - if you want to remove elements as you print):**
   - **Method 1:** Using a `while` loop and the `poll()` method removes and returns the head (highest priority element) of the queue until the queue is empty.  If you don't want to modify the original queue, avoid this method.



This improved version provides more options for printing the elements and explains the difference between destructive and non-destructive methods.  It also clearly demonstrates how to use a `PriorityQueue` with strings.
