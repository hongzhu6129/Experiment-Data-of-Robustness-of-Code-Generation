Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles null and empty input:** The `removeDuplicates` method now correctly handles cases where the input array is null or empty, returning 0 in both situations.
- **Clearer output:** The `main` method now prints the updated length and the relevant portion of the modified array using `Arrays.copyOfRange`. This makes it easier to see the effect of the `removeDuplicates` method.
- **Added test cases:** Included test cases for empty and null input to demonstrate the robustness of the code.  This helps verify that the code handles these edge cases correctly.


The core logic of the `removeDuplicates` method is efficient and adheres to the in-place modification requirement with O(1) extra memory. It iterates through the array, maintaining an index `uniqueIndex` for the next unique element.  When a new unique element is found, it's placed at `uniqueIndex` and the index is incremented.
