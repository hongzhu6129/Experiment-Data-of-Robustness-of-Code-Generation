Explanation and Key Improvements:

1. **TreeNode Class:** A `TreeNode` class is defined to represent the structure of the binary tree nodes. This makes the code more organized and easier to understand.

2. **Clearer Base Cases:** The `is_Identical_tree_node` method handles the base cases more explicitly:
   - If both `p` and `q` are `null`, they are considered identical.
   - If only one of `p` or `q` is `null`, they are not identical.

3. **Value Comparison:**  The code now checks if the values of the current nodes (`p.val` and `q.val`) are equal. If not, the trees are not identical.

4. **Recursive Calls:** The recursive calls to `is_Identical_tree_node` for the left and right subtrees are combined using the logical AND operator (`&&`). This ensures that both subtrees must be identical for the entire trees to be considered identical.

5. **Example Usage in main:** The `main` method demonstrates how to create `TreeNode` objects and use the `is_Identical_tree_node` method to compare different trees. This makes the code easier to test and understand.  It also includes test cases for null trees.



This revised code provides a more robust and clear solution for checking if two binary trees are identical, adhering to the specified method signatures.
