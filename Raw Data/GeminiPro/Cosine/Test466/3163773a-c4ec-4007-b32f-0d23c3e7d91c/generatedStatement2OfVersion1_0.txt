Key Improvements:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes robust error handling using `try-catch` blocks to prevent crashes if the input string is not in the expected format. It returns `null` if parsing fails, allowing the calling code to handle the error gracefully.  You can modify it to throw an exception if that's preferable in your application.
* **Clearer Examples:** The `main` method provides examples of how to use the function with different date and time formats, including ISO 8601 and a custom format.
* **Helper Functions:**  Separating date, datetime, and time conversion into individual functions makes the code more organized, readable, and reusable.
* **DateTimeFormatter:** Uses `DateTimeFormatter` for flexibility in handling various date and time patterns.
* **Best Practices:** Follows Java naming conventions and best practices for exception handling.


Now you have a much more complete and reliable string-to-date conversion program. Remember to handle the `null` return value appropriately in the part of your code that calls these conversion methods.
