**Test Cases:**

It's difficult to directly unit test `SystemTime.getCurrentTime()` because it relies on the system clock, which is constantly changing. Instead, we can test aspects like formatting and edge cases around time zones (though this code doesn't explicitly handle time zones, so it relies on the system's default).  More sophisticated time handling would use `ZonedDateTime` and allow you to inject a clock for testing purposes.

Here's a testing approach that focuses on format validation:
