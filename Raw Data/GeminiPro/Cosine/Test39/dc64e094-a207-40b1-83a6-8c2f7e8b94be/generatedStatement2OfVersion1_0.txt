**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`Instant` for Precision:** Uses `java.time.Instant` for accurate time measurement.  This is preferred over `System.currentTimeMillis()` for time differences.
2. **`Duration` for Time Difference:**  `java.time.Duration` handles the time difference calculation correctly.
3. **Clear Output Formatting:**  The output is formatted for readability (seconds and milliseconds).
4. **Handles Untracked Case:** Checks if `startTime` is null (tracking hasn't begun) and provides a message.
5. **`toMillisPart()` (Java 9+):** For Java 9 and later, you can directly get the millisecond part using `toMillisPart()`.  For older Java versions, you would need to calculate the remainder after dividing seconds by 1000 to get the milliseconds.
6. **Test Cases:**  The `main` method now includes several test cases:
   - Basic usage with a sleep
   - Immediate display after starting
   - Displaying when tracking hasn't started
   - Longer duration test
   - A test showing that sub-millisecond timings aren't very reliable (due to system limitations).
