Explanation and Improvements:

1. **User Input:** The code now takes user input for the date using a `Scanner`.  This makes it more interactive and flexible.
2. **Date Validation:** It uses a `try-catch` block to handle `DateTimeParseException`. This is essential for robust code, preventing crashes if the user enters an invalid date format.
3. **Clearer Output:** The output message is more informative, including the year and the entered month's name.
4. **LocalDate:** The `LocalDate` class from the `java.time` package (introduced in Java 8) provides a modern and much-improved way to work with dates. It's preferred over older classes like `Date` and `Calendar`.
5. **ISO_DATE Format:** Using `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE` makes it clear that the expected input format is "yyyy-MM-dd".
6. **getMonthValue():**  Using `getMonthValue()` directly gets the numerical value of the month (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.), making the calculation of remaining months straightforward.
