Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `safeCharAt()` method. This is crucial because the `charAt()` method throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if you try to access an index that is out of range (less than 0 or greater than or equal to the string's length).  `safeCharAt` demonstrates how to prevent this crash by checking the index bounds before calling `charAt()`.  Returning a space (' ') indicates an invalid index; you could also return a different character or throw your own exception.

2. **Clearer Output and Explanations:** The `println` statements are more informative, indicating which string and index are being used. The code also includes an explanation printed to the console if an index is out of bounds.

3. **Demonstrates Out-of-Bounds and Negative Index:**  The code now explicitly shows what happens when you try to access an index that is outside the string's valid range (using `index3`) and when using a negative index.

4. **Helper Method for Reusability:** The `safeCharAt()` method makes the code more reusable and keeps the `main()` method cleaner.


This improved version provides a more robust and educational example of how to get a character at a specific index in Java, addressing potential errors and explaining the process more effectively.
