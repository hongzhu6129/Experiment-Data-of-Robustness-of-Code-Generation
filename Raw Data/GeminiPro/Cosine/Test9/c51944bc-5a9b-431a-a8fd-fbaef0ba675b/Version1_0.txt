```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SwapVariables {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter the first variable:");
        int a = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Enter the second variable:");
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Before swapping: a = " + a + ", b = " + b);

        // Swapping using a temporary variable
        int temp = a;
        a = b;
        b = temp;


        System.out.println("After swapping: a = " + a + ", b = " + b);
         scanner.close(); // Close the scanner to prevent resource leaks
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

1. **General Case:**
   - Input: a = 5, b = 10
   - Expected Output: Before swapping: a = 5, b = 10
                     After swapping: a = 10, b = 5

2. **Zero Values:**
   - Input: a = 0, b = 15
   - Expected Output: Before swapping: a = 0, b = 15
                     After swapping: a = 15, b = 0

3. **Negative Values:**
   - Input: a = -3, b = 7
   - Expected Output: Before swapping: a = -3, b = 7
                     After swapping: a = 7, b = -3

4. **Identical Values:**  (This is a corner case�though simple, it's important to ensure identical values are handled correctly)
   - Input: a = 5, b = 5
   - Expected Output: Before swapping: a = 5, b = 5
                     After swapping: a = 5, b = 5

5. **Large Values:** (Tests potential integer overflow if you were using a smaller data type, though `int` is unlikely to overflow in typical scenarios)
   - Input: a = 2147483647, b = -2147483648  (Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE)
   - Expected Output: Before swapping: a = 2147483647, b = -2147483648
                     After swapping: a = -2147483648, b = 2147483647



**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You can manually input these test values when prompted by the program.  For more automated testing, you would typically use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a very simple example of how you might structure a JUnit test (you would need to add the JUnit library to your project):

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class SwapVariablesTest {

    @Test
    void testGeneralCase() {
        // Set up - not really needed here since main() handles input
        // Execution and Assertion
        //  (In real JUnit tests, you wouldn't typically test main() directly 
        //   because of the console I/O.  You'd create a separate swap() method)
        //  This example demonstrates the concept.  Realistically, you'd redirect System.out
        //  to test console output if you absolutely needed to test main().

        // ... (logic to simulate input and capture output) ...
    }

    // ... other test methods for different cases ...

}
```


This improved answer provides a more robust set of test cases and gives a basic idea of how you would structure tests using JUnit for a more professional approach.  Remember to always handle resource closing (like the `Scanner`) to avoid resource leaks.
