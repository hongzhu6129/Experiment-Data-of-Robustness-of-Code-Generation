**Explanation and Key improvements:**

1. **Generic Swap Method:**  The `swapGeneric` method demonstrates swapping using generics. This allows you to use the same method for various data types, including `Integer` and `String`. The use of wrapper classes is essential when dealing with objects (like `Integer` or `String`) within a generic method.


2. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The provided test cases cover various scenarios including positive and negative numbers, zero, identical numbers, `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` (corner case), large numbers close to integer limits, Strings and even nulls.

3. **Clear Output:** The output is structured with clear labels to indicate what's happening within each swap attempt and which variables are affected, inside and outside the methods.

4. **Pass-by-Value Clarification:** The `swap` method demonstrates the important concept of pass-by-value in Java.  Primitive types (like `int`) are passed by value.  This means a copy of the variable's value is sent to the method. Modifications inside the method do not affect the original variables in `main`. The output clarifies this.

5. **Wrapper Classes (Integer):**  Using `Integer` objects in the `swapGeneric` method is crucial, especially when dealing with large numbers.  This prevents potential overflow issues that could occur with primitive `int`.




This improved version provides a more robust and illustrative example of swapping variables in Java while also clarifying important concepts about how Java handles method arguments.
