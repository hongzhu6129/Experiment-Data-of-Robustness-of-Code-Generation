**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input | Expected Output | Reason/Corner Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | 0 is even. | Zero is considered even. |
| 2 | 1 | 1 is odd. |  Basic odd number test. |
| 3 | 2 | 2 is even. | Basic even number test. |
| 4 | -1 | -1 is odd. |  Negative odd number test. |
| 5 | -2 | -2 is even. | Negative even number test. |
| 6 | 1000 | 1000 is even. | Large positive even number. |
| 7 | -1001 | -1001 is odd. | Large negative odd number. |
| 8 | Integer.MAX_VALUE | Integer.MAX_VALUE is odd. |  Largest possible Java `int` (odd). |
| 9 | Integer.MIN_VALUE | Integer.MIN_VALUE is even. | Smallest possible Java `int` (even).|



**How to run the test cases:**

1. **Manual Testing:**  You can manually enter each input value and verify that the program's output matches the expected output in the table.

2. **Automated Testing (Recommended - JUnit example):**  For more robust testing, especially as your program grows, use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's how you might write a JUnit test class:
