**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that can occur during file reading. This is crucial for robust code.  It prints an error message if the file is not found or there's another problem.

2. **`readLinesFromFile` Helper Method:** The file reading logic is encapsulated in a separate `readLinesFromFile` method. This makes the `main` method cleaner and more readable, and promotes code reusability.

3. **List to Array Conversion:** The code efficiently converts the `List<String>` to a `String[]` using `lines.toArray(new String[0])`.  This creates an array of the correct size.

4. **Clearer Comments:**  Comments are added to explain the code's purpose and the importance of replacing the placeholder filename.

5. **Resource Management (try-with-resources):** The `BufferedReader` is used inside a try-with-resources block. This ensures that the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed even if exceptions occur, preventing resource leaks.


**How to Use:**

1. **Create a text file:** Create a text file named `your_file.txt` (or any name you prefer) in the same directory as your Java file.  Put some text in it, with each line representing a separate entry you want in the array.
2. **Replace Placeholder:**  In the Java code, replace `"your_file.txt"` with the actual path to your text file if it's in a different location.
3. **Compile and Run:** Compile and run the Java code. The output will be the contents of your file, printed as a String array.
