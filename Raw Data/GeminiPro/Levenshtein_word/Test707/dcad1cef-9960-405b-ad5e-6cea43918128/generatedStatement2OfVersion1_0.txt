Explanation:

1. **`Column(int n)` method:**
   - Takes an integer `n` (the column number) as input.
   - Uses a `StringBuilder` to build the column name because we need to append characters in reverse order.
   - The `while` loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `rem = n % 26` calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 26 (since there are 26 letters in the alphabet).
     - **Handling the 'Z' case:** If `rem` is 0, it means the last letter should be 'Z', and we need to adjust `n` accordingly (subtract 1 after dividing by 26). This is crucial for cases like 26, 52, 78, etc.
     - **Other letters:** If `rem` is not 0, we calculate the corresponding character by adding `rem - 1` to 'A'.
     - `n = n / 26` updates `n` for the next iteration.
   - Finally, we reverse the `StringBuilder` using `reverse()` and convert it to a string using `toString()`.

2. **`main` method:**
   - Includes test cases to demonstrate how to use the `Column` method and the expected output.



Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles 'Z' correctly:**  The code now correctly handles cases where the column name includes 'Z' (e.g., 26, 52, 702).
- **Uses `StringBuilder`:**  Using `StringBuilder` for string manipulation within the loop is more efficient than repeated string concatenation.
- **Clearer variable names:** Using more descriptive variable names like `columnName` improves readability.
- **Comprehensive test cases:**  The included test cases cover a wider range of input values, including edge cases like 1, 26, 701, 702, and larger numbers.
