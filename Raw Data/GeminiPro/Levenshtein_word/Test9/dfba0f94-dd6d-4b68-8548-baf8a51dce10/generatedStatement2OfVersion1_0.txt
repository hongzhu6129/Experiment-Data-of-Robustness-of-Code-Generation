**Explanation of Test Cases:**

1. **Regular Numbers:**  Tests basic functionality with positive integers.
2. **Negative Numbers:** Ensures the swap works correctly with negative values.
3. **Zero Values:** Tests edge cases where one or both inputs are zero.  Zero often causes unique behavior in arithmetic operations.
4. **Large Numbers:** Uses `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` to test behavior at the extreme limits of integer representation.  Large positive numbers are also included. This can reveal potential overflow issues if a less robust swapping method (like using addition and subtraction) were employed.

**Why XOR swap is preferred:**

The XOR swap method is often preferred because:

* **No temporary variable:**  It swaps the numbers in place without needing an extra variable.
* **Avoids overflow:** Unlike swapping with addition and subtraction, the XOR method will not cause integer overflow, even if the sum of the two numbers exceeds the maximum integer value.
