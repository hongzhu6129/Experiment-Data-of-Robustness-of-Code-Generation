            System.out.print("==");
            for (int j = 0; j < 46; j++) {

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Star Field:**  The code now correctly prints 5 rows of 6 stars, interspersed with the "pct" centered in the 3rd row of the star field.
2. **Stripes:** The code prints 6 rows of red stripes (represented by `==` followed by a long series of `=` to represent the length).
3. **Alignment:** The code is structured to align the stars and stripes sections more accurately, and the spacing within the "pct" row is adjusted for better centering. 
4. **Clarity and Readability:** The code uses more meaningful variable names (though limited within the constraint of a single `main` method) and includes comments to explain the logic.
5. **Simplification:** Removed unnecessary complexity while still achieving the desired output within the confines of using only the `main` method.
6. **`pct` handling**: The `pct` string is handled specifically in the center of the star field area as required.



This improved version provides a much better representation of the American flag while still adhering to the challenging constraint of using only the `main` method.  It's obviously simplified due to this limitation, but it captures the essential visual elements.
