```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class TrimArrayListCapacity {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Create an ArrayList with an initial capacity
        ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>(20); // Initial capacity of 20

        // 2. Add elements to the ArrayList (fewer than the initial capacity)
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            numbers.add(i);
        }

        // 3. Print initial size and capacity
        System.out.println("Initial size: " + numbers.size()); // Output: 10
        System.out.println("Initial capacity: " + getCapacity(numbers)); // Output: 20 (or higher, depending on implementation)

        // 4. Trim the capacity to the current size using trimToSize()
        numbers.trimToSize();

        // 5. Print size and capacity after trimming
        System.out.println("Size after trimToSize(): " + numbers.size()); // Output: 10
        System.out.println("Capacity after trimToSize(): " + getCapacity(numbers)); // Output: 10 (or close to it)


        // Example showing why trimming can be useful (memory saving)
        ArrayList<String> largeList = new ArrayList<>(1000000); // Large initial capacity
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            largeList.add("Some string"); // Add only 10,000 elements
        }

        System.out.println("Large list initial capacity: " + getCapacity(largeList));

        largeList.trimToSize();

        System.out.println("Large list capacity after trimming: " + getCapacity(largeList)); // Significant reduction in capacity

        // Important Note: trimToSize() in newer Java versions (11+) might not always 
        // give the exact size as the capacity. The internal implementation can vary.


        // Creating a new ArrayList with the correct size: Another way to "trim"
        ArrayList<Integer> trimmedList = new ArrayList<>(numbers); // Copies elements


        System.out.println("New trimmed list size: " + trimmedList.size());
        System.out.println("New trimmed list capacity : " + getCapacity(trimmedList)); // Similar to size


    }


    // Helper function to get the capacity (implementation detail not directly accessible)
    //  - Reflection is used for educational/demonstration purposes here. 
    //  - This shouldn't be done in regular production code.
    static int getCapacity(ArrayList<?> list) {

        try {
            java.lang.reflect.Field elementDataField = ArrayList.class.getDeclaredField("elementData");
            elementDataField.setAccessible(true);
            return ((Object[]) elementDataField.get(list)).length;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return -1; // Or handle appropriately in a real application
        }

    }



}

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Explanation:**  Added comments to guide learners through each step of the process.
2. **Initial Capacity:**  Demonstrates how to set the initial capacity of an `ArrayList`.
3. **`trimToSize()`:** Shows how to use the `trimToSize()` method effectively.
4. **Realistic Example:**  Includes an example with a larger `ArrayList` to illustrate the benefits of trimming for memory saving.
5. **Capacity Check:**  Provides a helper method `getCapacity()` to access and print the capacity of the `ArrayList` (for educational purposes � reflection explained in the code).  This makes it clear what `trimToSize()` does.
6. **Alternative Trimming Method:** Showed a second way to achieve effectively the same result by creating a new `ArrayList` with the size of the original. This is a clean, though potentially more expensive, way to "trim".
7. **Important Note on Java 11+:** Added a very important note explaining that `trimToSize()`'s behavior may be different in more recent Java versions and the capacity might not exactly equal size after trimming.
8. **Helper Function Note:** Emphasized that reflection is not ideal for normal coding practice and is only used here for demonstration in the educational context.


This improved educational example now provides a much more complete and accurate understanding of how to trim the capacity of an `ArrayList` in Java and when it's beneficial to do so.
