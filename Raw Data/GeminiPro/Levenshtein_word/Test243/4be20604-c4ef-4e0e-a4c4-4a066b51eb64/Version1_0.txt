    /**
     * Given a sorted array of integers, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.
     * The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
     * Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
     * Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
     * Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
     *
     * Example:
     * Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
     * Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
     * Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
     * It does not matter what you leave beyond the first five elements.
     *
     * @param nums sorted array of integers
     * @return updated length of the array after removing duplicates

Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Comments:**  Added detailed Javadoc-style comments to `removeDuplicates` explaining the purpose, parameters, return value, and providing an example.  Added inline comments in `main` for test cases.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Included several test cases in `main`:
    * An example with multiple duplicates (the original example).
    * A simpler case with fewer elements.
    * An empty array.
    * An array with a single element.  These cover important edge cases.
* **Output Formatting:**  The output now clearly shows the value of `k` and the first `k` elements of the modified array using `Arrays.copyOfRange` and `Arrays.toString` for easy visualization.
* **Error Handling:**  Included a check at the beginning of `removeDuplicates` to handle `null` or empty input arrays gracefully.
* **Efficiency:**  The algorithm itself is already efficient (O(n) time, O(1) space), so no algorithmic changes were necessary.


This revised code provides a much better educational example, demonstrating good coding practices and clearly illustrating how to solve the problem. It also makes the output much more informative and easier to understand.
