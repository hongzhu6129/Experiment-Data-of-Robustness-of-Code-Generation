```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class LinkedListFirstElement {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedList<String> names = new LinkedList<>();

        // Add some names to the LinkedList
        names.add("Alice");
        names.add("Bob");
        names.add("Charlie");

        // Check if the list is empty before attempting to retrieve the first element
        if (!names.isEmpty()) {
            String firstElement = names.peekFirst(); // or names.getFirst();  Both work. peekFirst is generally preferred as it doesn't throw an exception on empty lists.

            System.out.println("First element: " + firstElement); // Output: Alice

            // Verify that the element is still in the LinkedList
            System.out.println("Linked List: " + names); // Output: [Alice, Bob, Charlie] (demonstrating it's not removed)
        } else {
            System.out.println("The LinkedList is empty.");
        }


        // Example with an empty list to demonstrate peekFirst's behavior:
         LinkedList<String> emptyNames = new LinkedList<>();
         String firstEmpty = emptyNames.peekFirst(); // Returns null, doesn't throw an exception.

        if (firstEmpty == null) {
             System.out.println("The LinkedList is empty (demonstrated with peekFirst)");
        }


       // Showing getFirst() behavior with an empty list (for comparison):
        // This is commented out because it will cause a NoSuchElementException if uncommented and run.
       /*
        LinkedList<String> emptyNames2 = new LinkedList<>();
        String firstEmpty2 = emptyNames2.getFirst();  // Throws NoSuchElementException if the list is empty
        System.out.println(firstEmpty2); 
       */
    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

1. **Handles Empty List:**  It includes a check using `!names.isEmpty()` to ensure the LinkedList is not empty before trying to retrieve the first element. This prevents `NoSuchElementException` if you try to get the first element of an empty list.

2. **`peekFirst()` vs. `getFirst()`:**  Both methods retrieve the first element without removing it.  However, `peekFirst()` returns `null` if the list is empty, while `getFirst()` throws a `NoSuchElementException`.  `peekFirst()` is generally preferred for its safer handling of empty lists.  The code demonstrates both, but comments out the `getFirst()` example on an empty list to avoid the exception.

3. **Clearer Output:**  The output now explicitly confirms that the element was *not* removed from the LinkedList, making the demonstration more complete.

4. **Example with Empty List:**  The code now includes an example showing how `peekFirst()` handles empty lists by returning `null`.  It also shows (as a commented-out example) how `getFirst()` throws an exception with an empty list, emphasizing why `peekFirst()` is often preferred.

5. **Comments:** The code includes more comments to explain the choices and demonstrate good practice.
