```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
        double num1 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
        double num2 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Sum: " + (num1 + num2));
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (num1 - num2));
        System.out.println("Product: " + (num1 * num2));

        if (num2 != 0) {
            System.out.println("Quotient: " + (num1 / num2));
            System.out.println("Remainder: " + (num1 % num2));
        } else {
            System.out.println("Division by zero is not allowed.");
            System.out.println("Remainder by zero is not allowed.");
        }

        input.close(); 
    }
}
```


**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 3. Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2 | 0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | Division by zero | Remainder by zero |
| 6. Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000 | 2 | 0 |
| 7. Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13 | 8 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0 |
| 8. Integer and Decimal | 10 | 2.5 | 12.5 | 7.5 | 25 | 4 | 0 |
| 9.  Negative Decimal Numbers| -5.2 | 2.1 | -3.1 | -7.3 | -10.92 | -2.476... (approx) | ... (remainder handling for floating-point can be complex) |
| 10. Zero and Negative | 0 | -5 | -5 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |




**How to Run the Tests:**

You can manually enter these test cases into the program or, even better, create automated tests using a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a very basic example of how you might start with JUnit (you'll need to add the JUnit library to your project):

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class ArithmeticOperationsTest {

    @Test
    void testPositiveNumbers() {
        // You would need to capture the output of your main method 
        //  and compare it to the expected values, which is more advanced. 
        //  This is a placeholder to show the general structure.
        assertEquals(15, ArithmeticOperations.add(10, 5)); // Example assuming you create an add() method.
        // ... similar tests for subtract, multiply, etc. 
    }

     // ... add more @Test methods for the other test cases
}
```



By using a testing framework, you can automate the process of running tests and verifying that your program produces the correct results for a wide range of inputs.  This is extremely helpful for ensuring the correctness and reliability of your code.
