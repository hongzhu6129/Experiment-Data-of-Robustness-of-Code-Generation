```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        double num1 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        double num2 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Sum: " + (num1 + num2));
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (num1 - num2));
        System.out.println("Product: " + (num1 * num2));

        if (num2 != 0) {
            System.out.println("Quotient: " + (num1 / num2));
            System.out.println("Remainder: " + (num1 % num2));
        } else {
            System.out.println("Division by zero is not allowed.");
            // Or you could throw an exception:  throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero!");
        }


        input.close();
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 2 | -5 | 2 | -3 | -7 | -10 | -2.5 | -1 |
| 3 | 0 | 10 | 10 | -10 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 7 | 0 | 7 | 7 | 0 | "Division by zero" | "Division by zero"|  *(Corner Case: Division by zero)*
| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | "Division by zero" | "Division by zero"| *(Corner Case: Both numbers are zero)*
| 6 | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13 | 8 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0 | *(Floating-point numbers)*
| 7 | -2.5 | -1.5 | -4 | -1 | 3.75 | 1.666... | -1| *(Negative floating-point numbers)*
| 8 | Integer.MAX_VALUE | 1 | Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1 (overflow) | Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1 | Integer.MAX_VALUE | Integer.MAX_VALUE | 0 | *(Integer Overflow)*
| 9 | Integer.MIN_VALUE | -1 | Integer.MIN_VALUE - 1 (underflow)| Integer.MIN_VALUE + 1 | Integer.MIN_VALUE * -1 (overflow possible)  | Integer.MIN_VALUE | 0 | *(Integer Underflow)*


**Explanation of Corner Cases and How the Code Handles Them:**

* **Division by Zero:** The code explicitly checks if `num2` is zero. If it is, it prints an informative message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.  Alternatively, an `ArithmeticException` could be thrown, which is a more robust way to handle this error in a larger program.

* **Both Numbers are Zero:**  The code handles this case correctly. The sum, difference, and product are all zero. The division by zero check prevents an `ArithmeticException`, and the appropriate message is printed.

* **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**  Java handles integer overflow and underflow by "wrapping around."  For example, `Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1` will result in `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.  While the code performs the calculations, the results might not be what you expect in these overflow/underflow situations.  Testing for these cases helps understand the limitations of integer arithmetic.


It's important to test your code with a variety of inputs, especially edge cases and boundary conditions, to ensure it behaves correctly in all situations. This helps identify potential bugs and makes the code more robust.
