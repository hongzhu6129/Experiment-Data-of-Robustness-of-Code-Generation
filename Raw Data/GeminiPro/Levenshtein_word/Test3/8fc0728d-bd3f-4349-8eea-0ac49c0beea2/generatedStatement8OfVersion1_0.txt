4. **Large Number:**
   - Input: `12345` (or any large number within the `int` range)
   - Expected Output: The multiplication table should be correctly calculated and displayed. This tests for potential integer overflow issues (although unlikely with multiplication up to 10).

5. **Small Number (Close to Zero):**
    - Input: `1` (or `-1`)
    - Expected Output:  Verify the table is generated correctly for these small values. This is useful because sometimes there can be off-by-one errors in loop conditions, especially near boundary values.


**How to Run and Test:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `MultiplicationTable.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac MultiplicationTable.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code using: `java MultiplicationTable`
4. **Input:** Enter the desired input number when prompted.

You can automate these tests by creating a separate testing class using JUnit or TestNG. This will make the testing process more robust and repeatable, especially as your code grows.
