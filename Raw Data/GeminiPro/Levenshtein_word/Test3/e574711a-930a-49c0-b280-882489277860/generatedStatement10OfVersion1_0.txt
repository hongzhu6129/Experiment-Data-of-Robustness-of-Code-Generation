5. **Invalid Input (Non-integer):**  (Important to consider how your program handles bad input)
   Input:  hello
   Expected Behavior: The program should gracefully handle the `InputMismatchException` that the `Scanner` will throw.  A good approach would be to catch the exception, print an error message, and possibly exit or prompt the user to enter a valid integer.


This set of test cases covers positive, zero, negative, large, and invalid input scenarios, which provides good coverage for testing the `printScalarTable` method.  The large number case highlights why it's good practice to think about potential overflow issues when working with integers (though in this specific case, up to x10, you are very unlikely to experience overflow).  The invalid input case is crucial because robust programs must handle unexpected user input.
