```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScalarTable {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        printScalarTable(number);

        scanner.close(); 
    }

    public static void printScalarTable(int number) {
        System.out.println("Scalar Table for " + number + ":");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(number + " x " + i + " = " + (number * i));
        }
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

1. **Positive Number:**
   Input: 7
   Expected Output:
   ```
   Scalar Table for 7:
   7 x 1 = 7
   7 x 2 = 14
   7 x 3 = 21
   7 x 4 = 28
   7 x 5 = 35
   7 x 6 = 42
   7 x 7 = 49
   7 x 8 = 56
   7 x 9 = 63
   7 x 10 = 70
   ```

2. **Zero:**
   Input: 0
   Expected Output:
   ```
   Scalar Table for 0:
   0 x 1 = 0
   0 x 2 = 0
   0 x 3 = 0
   0 x 4 = 0
   0 x 5 = 0
   0 x 6 = 0
   0 x 7 = 0
   0 x 8 = 0
   0 x 9 = 0
   0 x 10 = 0
   ```

3. **Negative Number:**
   Input: -5
   Expected Output:
   ```
   Scalar Table for -5:
   -5 x 1 = -5
   -5 x 2 = -10
   -5 x 3 = -15
   -5 x 4 = -20
   -5 x 5 = -25
   -5 x 6 = -30
   -5 x 7 = -35
   -5 x 8 = -40
   -5 x 9 = -45
   -5 x 10 = -50
   ```

4. **Large Number:**  (Tests potential integer overflow if you were multiplying by much larger numbers - not an issue with multiplication up to 10)
   Input: 2147483647  (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
   Expected Output (correct, but shows how overflow could become a problem if multiplying by larger numbers):
   ```
   Scalar Table for 2147483647:
   ...  (table entries)
   2147483647 x 10 = 21474836470 
   ```


5. **Invalid Input (Non-integer):**  (Important to consider how your program handles bad input)
   Input:  hello
   Expected Behavior: The program should gracefully handle the `InputMismatchException` that the `Scanner` will throw.  A good approach would be to catch the exception, print an error message, and possibly exit or prompt the user to enter a valid integer.


This set of test cases covers positive, zero, negative, large, and invalid input scenarios, which provides good coverage for testing the `printScalarTable` method.  The large number case highlights why it's good practice to think about potential overflow issues when working with integers (though in this specific case, up to x10, you are very unlikely to experience overflow).  The invalid input case is crucial because robust programs must handle unexpected user input.
