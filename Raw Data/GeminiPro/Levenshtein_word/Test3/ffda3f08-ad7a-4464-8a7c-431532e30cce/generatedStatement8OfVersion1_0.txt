4. **Large Positive Number:**
   - Input: `1000` (or any large positive number)
   - Expected Output: Table up to 11 times the number (check for potential integer overflow if using very very large numbers, though this is less of a concern with `int` which can hold up to 2.1 billion).

5. **Large Negative Number:**
   - Input: `-1000` (or any large negative number)
   - Expected Output: Similar to the large positive number test, but with negative results.  Again, consider integer overflow if testing extreme values.

6. **One:**
   - Input: `1`
   - Expected Output: Table of 1 (1, 2, 3,... 11).  This ensures correct handling of the identity element for multiplication.




**How to Run the Test Cases (Manually):**

1. Save the code as `MultiplicationTable.java`.
2. Compile the code: `javac MultiplicationTable.java`
3. Run the code with different inputs: `java MultiplicationTable` and then enter the test input when prompted.  Compare the output to the expected output.




**Automated Testing (Recommended Best Practice):**

For more rigorous and automated testing, you can use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a simple JUnit example:
