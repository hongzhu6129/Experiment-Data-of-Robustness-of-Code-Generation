**Explanation and Test Cases:**

1. **`checkSum(int a, int b, int target)` function:** This function takes three integer arguments (a, b, and target) and returns true if the sum of `a` and `b` is equal to `target`, otherwise it returns false.


2. **Test Cases (using JUnit 5):**
   - **`testPositiveNumbers()`:** Tests with positive numbers.
   - **`testNegativeNumbers()`:** Tests with negative numbers.
   - **`testMixedNumbers()`:**  Tests with a mix of positive and negative numbers.
   - **`testZeroSum()`:** Tests a case where the sum is zero.
   - **`testLargeNumbers()`:** Tests with large numbers close to the integer limits.
   - **`testOverflow()`:**  **Corner Case:** Checks for integer overflow (when the sum exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE`).
   - **`testUnderflow()`:** **Corner Case:**  Checks for integer underflow (when the sum is less than `Integer.MIN_VALUE`).
   - **`testZeroTarget()`:** Tests with a target of zero.
   - **`testOnePositiveOneNegativeEqualTarget`:** Tests when one number is positive and the other negative and sums up to target.
   - **`testFalseCase`:** Tests a case when expected output should be `false`.


**How to Run the Tests:**

You will need JUnit 5 set up in your project. If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, it usually has built-in support for JUnit.  You can then run the tests directly from the IDE.

If you are using Maven or Gradle, make sure to include the JUnit 5 dependency in your `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle) file.  You can then run the tests using the appropriate Maven or Gradle command.  For example, `mvn test` for Maven.


**Key Improvements in this version:**

- **JUnit 5:** The tests are now written using JUnit 5, a more modern and powerful testing framework than JUnit 4.
- **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The tests cover a wider range of scenarios, including important corner cases like integer overflow and underflow. This makes the testing more robust.
- **Clearer Explanations:** The explanations of the code and test cases are more detailed.


This improved version provides a more complete and reliable way to test the `checkSum` function.
