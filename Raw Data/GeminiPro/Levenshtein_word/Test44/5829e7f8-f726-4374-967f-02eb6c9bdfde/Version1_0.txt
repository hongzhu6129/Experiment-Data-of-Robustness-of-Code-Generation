```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SumEqualsThird {

    public static boolean checkSum(int num1, int num2, int num3) {
        return (num1 + num2) == num3;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first integer: ");
        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the second integer: ");
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the third integer: ");
        int num3 = scanner.nextInt();


        boolean result = checkSum(num1, num2, num3);

        if (result) {
            System.out.println("The sum of the first two integers is equal to the third integer.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The sum of the first two integers is NOT equal to the third integer.");
        }

        scanner.close(); // Close the scanner to prevent resource leaks
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`checkSum` Method:** This method takes three integers as input and returns `true` if the sum of the first two equals the third, and `false` otherwise.  This improves code organization and makes the logic reusable.

2. **User Input:** The code now uses a `Scanner` to get input from the user, making it interactive.

3. **Clear Output:** The output messages clearly state whether the sum is equal to the third integer or not.

4. **Resource Management:** The `scanner.close()` statement is crucial for closing the `Scanner` and preventing resource leaks.

5. **Error Handling (Optional):**  For more robust code, you could add error handling to check if the user's input is actually an integer.  You could use a `try-catch` block to handle `InputMismatchException`.


**Example Usage:**

```
Enter the first integer: 5
Enter the second integer: 7
Enter the third integer: 12
The sum of the first two integers is equal to the third integer.

Enter the first integer: 2
Enter the second integer: 3
Enter the third integer: 6
The sum of the first two integers is NOT equal to the third integer.
```
