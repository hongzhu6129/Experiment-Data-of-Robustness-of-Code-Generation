Key improvements:

* **Handles empty array:**  Added a check at the beginning to handle the case where the input array is empty. This avoids potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
* **Clearer variable names:** Changed `k` to `uniqueCount` for better readability.
* **More comprehensive test cases:**  Included examples with an empty array and an array with no duplicates to demonstrate that the code handles these edge cases correctly.
* **Output includes modified array:** The `main` method now prints not only the updated length but also the modified array (up to the unique elements), making it easier to see the result of the `removeDuplicates` function.  It uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid printing the unmodified portion of the array.



This revised version is more robust and easier to understand.
