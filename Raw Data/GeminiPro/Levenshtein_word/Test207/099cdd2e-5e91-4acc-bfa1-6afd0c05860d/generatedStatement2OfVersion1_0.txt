This code adheres strictly to the requested method signatures.  It calculates the maximum depth (height) of a binary tree using recursion.

**Explanation:**

1. **Node Class:**  Represents a node in the binary tree. It has a `data` field and pointers to its `left` and `right` children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):**
   - **Base Case:** If the `node` is `null` (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**
     - Recursively calculate the depth of the left subtree (`lDepth`).
     - Recursively calculate the depth of the right subtree (`rDepth`).
     - Return the maximum of `lDepth` and `rDepth`, plus 1 (to account for the current node).

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - Creates a sample binary tree.
   - Calls the `maxDepth()` method to calculate the height and prints the result.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `BinaryTreeDepth.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then compile using the Java compiler: `javac BinaryTreeDepth.java`
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program: `java BinaryTreeDepth`


The output will be the height/maximum depth of the sample tree you created in the `main` method.
