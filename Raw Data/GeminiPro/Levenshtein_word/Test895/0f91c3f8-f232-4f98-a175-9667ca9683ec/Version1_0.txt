```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class RemoveElement {

    public static int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int k = 0; // Number of elements not equal to val

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[k] = nums[i];
                k++;
            }
        }

        return k;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 4, 6, 7, 6, 2};
        int val = 6;

        System.out.println("Original array: " + Arrays.toString(nums));

        int newLength = removeElement(nums, val);

        System.out.println("The length of the new array is: " + newLength);


        // Print the updated array (optional - the original array is modified in-place)
        int[] newArray = Arrays.copyOfRange(nums, 0, newLength); // Create a new array with the correct length
        System.out.println("New array: " + Arrays.toString(newArray));

    }
}
```


**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **In-Place Modification:** The `removeElement` method modifies the original array `nums` directly.  This is more efficient than creating a new array.  The elements not equal to `val` are moved to the beginning of the array.

2. **`k` as a Counter and Index:**  The variable `k` serves two purposes:
   - It keeps track of the number of elements that are *not* equal to `val`. This is the new length of the array.
   - It acts as the index where the next element that's not equal to `val` should be placed.

3. **Clearer Output:** The `main` method now prints both the original array and the new length. I've also added an optional part in the `main` method that shows how to create a new array containing only the updated elements if you need to work with a separate array.

4. **Conciseness and Efficiency:**  The code avoids unnecessary temporary variables or complex logic, making it more efficient and easier to understand.


**Example Usage and Output:**

```
Original array: [1, 4, 6, 7, 6, 2]
The length of the new array is: 4
New array: [1, 4, 7, 2] 
```
