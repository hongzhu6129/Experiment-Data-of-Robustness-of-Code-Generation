Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  Better variable names (k instead of j) and comments improve understanding.
* **Example Usage in `main`:**  Demonstrates how to use the `removeElement` method and prints the results clearly, including showing how to get a new array with the correct size using `Arrays.copyOfRange()`.  This makes the code more practical and easier to test.
* **Efficiency:** The algorithm itself is already quite efficient (O(n) time complexity).  No unnecessary operations are being performed.
* **Adherence to prompt:**  Strictly uses *only* the specified method signatures.


The output now correctly reflects the length of the modified array and also shows how to create a new array containing only the desired elements.  The original array passed to `removeElement` will be modified (elements after the `k`th position will be whatever was there before), but the returned length (`k`) is the critical piece of information.
