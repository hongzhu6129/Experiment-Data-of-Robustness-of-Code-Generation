**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Empty Array:**  The code now explicitly checks for an empty input array (`nums.length == 0`) and returns 0 in that case.

2. **Efficient In-Place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` method modifies the input array `nums` directly, avoiding the need to create a new array.  It maintains a `uniqueIndex` that tracks where the next unique element should be placed.

3. **Clearer `main` Method:** The `main` method now includes multiple test cases to demonstrate the functionality with different inputs (including an empty array and an array with no duplicates). The output is also improved to show both the updated length and the modified array (using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant portion).

4. **Concise and Readable:**  The code is more concise and easier to understand.  Comments explain the logic clearly.


This revised code directly addresses the prompt's requirements and offers a robust and efficient solution for removing duplicates from a sorted array in Java.
