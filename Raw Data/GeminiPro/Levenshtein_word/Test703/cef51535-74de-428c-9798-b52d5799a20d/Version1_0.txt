        long coefficient = binomial_Coefficient(n, k);

        if (coefficient > 0) {  // Part two: positive comparison.
            System.out.println("The binomial coefficient C(" + n + ", " + k + ") is: " + coefficient);
        } else {
            System.out.println("The binomial coefficient C(" + n + ", " + k + ") is not positive or inputs are invalid.");

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The `binomial_Coefficient` method now handles invalid input where `k` is outside the valid range (0 to `n`) by returning 0.  This prevents unexpected behavior or crashes.

2. **Symmetry Optimization:**  The code uses the symmetry property of binomial coefficients (C(n, k) = C(n, n-k)) to reduce calculations when `k` is greater than `n/2`.

3. **Efficiency and Overflow Prevention:** The calculation within the loop is rearranged to avoid potential integer overflows. By multiplying by `(n-i+1)` before dividing by `i`, we ensure that the intermediate results remain within the `long` data type's range for larger values of `n` and `k`.

4. **Positive Comparison:**  The `main` method now checks if the calculated coefficient is positive.  If it's not positive (meaning the inputs were invalid or resulted in a zero/negative coefficient), a message is printed indicating this.

5. **Clearer Output:** The output message is more informative, stating whether the coefficient is positive and displaying its value.

6. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed at the end of the program using `scanner.close()` which is good practice.


This improved version is more robust, efficient, and provides a better user experience.
