Key improvements and explanations:

* **CountDownLatch:**  The code now uses a `CountDownLatch` to ensure that the main thread waits for all the sorting threads to finish before exiting. This guarantees that all numbers are printed in the sorted order.  Previously, the `main` thread might finish before the slower sleep threads had a chance to print.

* **Clarity and Readability:**  Minor changes in formatting and comments enhance readability.

* **`finally` block:** The `latch.countDown()` is placed in a `finally` block to ensure that the latch is decremented even if an exception occurs within the thread.  This prevents deadlocks.

* **Clearer Output:** A newline character (`System.out.println()`) is added after the printing of each sorted array to make the output more organized, especially when testing with multiple arrays.

* **Removed unnecessary `run()` method:** The problem statement specifically asked *not* to use a `run()` method.  The code has been adjusted to start threads directly using lambda expressions, eliminating the need for a separate `Runnable` implementation.  This makes the code more concise.


This revised version addresses the concurrency issues, resulting in a reliable and correct Sleep Sort implementation that adheres to the provided method signature constraints.
