```java
public class ArithmeticOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // a. -5 + 8 * 6
        int resultA = -5 + 8 * 6;
        System.out.println("-5 + 8 * 6 = " + resultA); // Output: 43

        // b. (55+9) % 9
        int resultB = (55 + 9) % 9;
        System.out.println("(55+9) % 9 = " + resultB); // Output: 1

        // c. 20 + -3*5 / 8
        int resultC = 20 + -3 * 5 / 8;
        System.out.println("20 + -3*5 / 8 = " + resultC); // Output: 19  (Integer division)


        // d. 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3
        int resultD = 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3;
        System.out.println("5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3 = " + resultD); // Output: 13
    }
}
```


**Explanation of the Calculations and Integer Division:**

* **Integer Division:** In Java, when you divide two integers (like `-15 / 8`), the result is also an integer.  The fractional part is truncated (discarded), not rounded. So, `-15 / 8` results in `-1`.

* **Calculation c:**
   - `-3 * 5 = -15`
   - `-15 / 8 = -1` (integer division)
   - `20 + -1 = 19`

* **Calculation d:**  Follows standard order of operations (multiplication, division, modulo from left to right, then addition and subtraction from left to right).
   - `15 / 3 = 5`
   - `5 * 2 = 10`
   - `8 % 3 = 2`
   - `5 + 10 - 2 = 13`


**Key Points for Educational Purposes:**

1. **Operator Precedence:** Java follows standard operator precedence (PEMDAS/BODMAS - Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, and Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

2. **Integer Division:**  Emphasize the difference between integer division and floating-point division.  If you want a floating-point result, make at least one of the operands a floating-point number (e.g., `15.0 / 3`).

3. **Modulo Operator:**  The modulo operator (`%`) gives the remainder of a division.


This improved explanation clarifies the integer division aspect, which is crucial for understanding why the results are as they are.  It also highlights important concepts like operator precedence.
