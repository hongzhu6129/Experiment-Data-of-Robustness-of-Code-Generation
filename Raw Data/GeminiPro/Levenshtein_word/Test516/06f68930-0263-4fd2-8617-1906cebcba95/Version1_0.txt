**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **HashSet for Cycle Detection:** The most crucial aspect of determining if a number is happy is detecting cycles. The code uses a `HashSet` called `seen` to store numbers encountered during the process. If a number is already in `seen`, it indicates a cycle, and the number is unhappy.

2. **Clearer Loop Condition:** The `while` loop condition is now `n != 1 && !seen.contains(n)`.  This makes it very explicit that the loop continues as long as the number isn't 1 AND it hasn't been seen before.

3. **Helper Function:** The `sumOfSquaresOfDigits` function is introduced to improve readability and modularity. It calculates the sum of the squares of a number's digits.

4. **Concise Return:**  The `return n == 1;` statement directly returns whether the final value of `n` is 1 (happy) or not.

5. **Main Method with Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `isHappy_number` function with a couple of example numbers.  I've also added the test cases from your prompt's examples to show they are handled correctly.


This improved version is more efficient, readable, and directly addresses the cycle detection requirement, which is the core of the happy number problem.
