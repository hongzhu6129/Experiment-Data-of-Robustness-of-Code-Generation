Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Empty Array:**  Added a check at the beginning to correctly handle the case where the input array is empty.
2. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `uniqueCount` instead of just `k` makes the code more readable and understandable.
3. **Concise Logic:** The core logic for removing duplicates is efficient and avoids unnecessary temporary variables.
4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes various test cases, including an empty array and an array with no duplicates, demonstrating the robustness of the `removeDuplicates` method.
5. **Outputting the Modified Array (Partially):** The `main` method now also prints the modified array (up to the new length) using `Arrays.copyOfRange`. This clarifies that the function modifies the input array in place.   Because the original array's size remains unchanged, only the relevant portion (up to `newLength`) is displayed.


This improved version is more efficient, handles edge cases correctly, and is easier to understand.
