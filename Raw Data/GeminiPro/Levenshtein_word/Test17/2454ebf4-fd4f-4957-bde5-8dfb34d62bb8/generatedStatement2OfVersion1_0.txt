**Test Cases:**

1. **Valid Binary Input:**
   - Input: "101101"
   - Expected Output: 45

2. **Single Digit Binary:**
   - Input: "1"
   - Expected Output: 1

3. **Zero Input:**
   - Input: "0"
   - Expected Output: 0

4. **Larger Binary Input:**
   - Input: "11111111"
   - Expected Output: 255

5. **Invalid Input (Non-Binary Character):**
   - Input: "101201"
   - Expected Output: "Invalid binary input. Please enter a string containing only 0s and 1s."

6. **Invalid Input (Empty String):**
   - Input: ""
   - Expected Output: 0 (This is a debatable choice. You could also choose to treat it as an error).

7. **Invalid Input (Leading Zeros):**
   - Input: "000101"
   - Expected Output: 5 (Leading zeros should be handled correctly).

8. **Invalid Input (Only Leading Zeros):**
    - Input: "000"
    - Expected Output: 0

9. **Corner Case (Maximum Integer Representation):**
    - Input: "1111111111111111111111111111111" (32 ones - maximum for a signed integer)
    - Expected Output: 2147483647


These test cases cover a range of scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, edge cases (single digit, zero), and a test that pushes the limits of integer representation. They ensure the `functionone` method handles different situations correctly.  Remember to consider how you want to handle the edge cases like empty strings and leading zeros. You can modify the error handling within `functionone` to be more specific if necessary (e.g., differentiate between empty string and non-binary character errors).
