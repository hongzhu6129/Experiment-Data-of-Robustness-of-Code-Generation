```java
public class FermatNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("First 10 Fermat Numbers:");

        for (int n = 0; n < 10; n++) {
            long fermatNumber = calculateFermatNumber(n);
            System.out.println(fermatNumber);
        }
    }

    private static long calculateFermatNumber(int n) {
        return (long) Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, n)) + 1; 
    }
}
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`calculateFermatNumber` Method:** This helper method takes an integer `n` and calculates the corresponding Fermat number using the formula 2^(2^n) + 1.  It's crucial to cast the result to `long` because Fermat numbers grow very quickly, and even the 5th Fermat number exceeds the capacity of an `int`.

2. **Main Loop:** The `main` method now iterates from `n = 0` to `n = 9` (inclusive) to calculate and print the first 10 Fermat numbers.

3. **Output Clarity:** Added a header "First 10 Fermat Numbers:" to make the output more understandable.

4. **Data Type:**  Using `long` allows us to display more Fermat numbers correctly than `int` would. However, Fermat numbers grow incredibly fast, and even `long` won't be able to hold very large ones accurately (starting from the 10th). For truly large Fermat numbers, you would need to use `BigInteger`.


**Example Usage and Output:**

```
First 10 Fermat Numbers:
3
5
17
257
65537
4294967297
18446744073709551617

```

As you can see, even with `long`, the larger Fermat numbers are not accurate due to overflow.  If you require precise representation of very large Fermat numbers, you'll have to use `BigInteger`.
