2. **Floating-Point Numbers:** To perform accurate calculations, we use `1.0`, `3.0`, etc., to ensure floating-point division (and prevent integer truncation).

3. **Clarity:** The code is now well-commented and clearly displays the two approximations.


**How to Run:**

1. Save the code as `ApproximatePi.java`.
2. Compile: `javac ApproximatePi.java`
3. Run:  `java ApproximatePi`



This improved code will provide more accurate and meaningful approximations of pi using the Leibniz formula.
