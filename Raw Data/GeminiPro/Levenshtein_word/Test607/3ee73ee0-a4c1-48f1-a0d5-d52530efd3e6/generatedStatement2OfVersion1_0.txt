Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

1. **Multiple Cloning Methods:** Demonstrates three different ways to clone a HashSet: using the constructor, the `clone()` method, and the `addAll()` method.  The constructor method is generally preferred for its simplicity and type safety.

2. **Clearer Explanations:** Includes comments explaining each cloning method and its advantages/disadvantages.

3. **Immutability Demonstration:** Shows how changes to the cloned HashSet do *not* affect the original HashSet, emphasizing the concept of creating a separate copy.

4. **Custom Object Example:**  Includes an example of cloning a HashSet containing custom objects (`MyObject`).  This is crucial because it highlights the importance of implementing `hashCode()` and `equals()` correctly in your custom classes when using them in HashSets.

5. **Best Practice Recommendation:** Clearly recommends using the constructor approach for cloning HashSets as the preferred method.

6. **Improved Custom Object Class:** The `MyObject` class now correctly implements `hashCode()` and `equals()` based on the `name` field, ensuring proper functionality within a HashSet.  This is essential to avoid unexpected behavior and duplicates.


This improved version provides a more comprehensive educational example of HashSet cloning in Java, covering different methods, best practices, and potential pitfalls with custom objects.
