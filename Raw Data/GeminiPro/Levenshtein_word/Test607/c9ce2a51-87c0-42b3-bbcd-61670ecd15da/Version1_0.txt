```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class HashSetClone {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Create a HashSet with some initial elements
        HashSet<String> originalSet = new HashSet<>();
        originalSet.add("apple");
        originalSet.add("banana");
        originalSet.add("orange");

        // Method 1: Using the constructor
        HashSet<String> clonedSet1 = new HashSet<>(originalSet);

        // Method 2: Using the clone() method (Less common and potentially unsafe with mutable objects within the HashSet)
        HashSet<String> clonedSet2 = (HashSet<String>) originalSet.clone();


        // Print the original and cloned sets
        System.out.println("Original Set: " + originalSet);
        System.out.println("Cloned Set 1 (Constructor): " + clonedSet1);
        System.out.println("Cloned Set 2 (clone() method): " + clonedSet2);


        // Demonstrate that changes to the cloned set don't affect the original set
        clonedSet1.add("grape");
        System.out.println("\nAfter adding 'grape' to Cloned Set 1:");
        System.out.println("Original Set: " + originalSet);
        System.out.println("Cloned Set 1: " + clonedSet1);


         // Demonstrate potential issues with clone() when storing mutable objects
        HashSet<StringBuilder> mutableSet = new HashSet<>();
        StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("hello");
        mutableSet.add(sb1);

        HashSet<StringBuilder> clonedMutableSet = (HashSet<StringBuilder>) mutableSet.clone();

        // Modifying the StringBuilder in the original set ALSO affects the cloned set!
        sb1.append(" world"); 
        System.out.println("\nDemonstrating shallow copy with mutable objects:");
        System.out.println("Original Mutable Set: " + mutableSet);
        System.out.println("Cloned Mutable Set: " + clonedMutableSet);  // "world" appears here too!



        // BEST PRACTICE for Cloning with Mutable Objects: Deep Copy (Manual cloning of each element)
        HashSet<StringBuilder> deepClonedSet = new HashSet<>();
        for(StringBuilder sb : mutableSet) {
            deepClonedSet.add(new StringBuilder(sb.toString())); // Create new StringBuilder objects
        }

        //Now modifying original won't affect the deep copy
        sb1.append("!");
        System.out.println("\nDemonstrating deep copy with mutable objects:");
        System.out.println("Original Mutable Set: " + mutableSet);
        System.out.println("Deep Cloned Set: " + deepClonedSet); // "!" does NOT appear here


    }

Key improvements and explanations in this educational example:

1. **Two Cloning Methods:** Shows both the constructor method (recommended) and the `clone()` method.
2. **Clear Output:**  Clearly labels the sets and their contents at each stage, making it easy to follow.
3. **Mutability Demonstration:** Demonstrates the crucial difference between shallow and deep copying, especially when dealing with mutable objects like `StringBuilder`.  This helps highlight the potential pitfalls of using `clone()` directly with HashSets containing mutable objects.
4. **Deep Copy Solution:** Provides a solution for deep copying HashSets with mutable objects, which is essential for true independence between the original and cloned sets.
5. **Best Practice Emphasis:** Highlights the preferred method (constructor) and explains why it's generally safer and more efficient.
6. **Detailed Comments:**  Explains each step and highlights potential issues.


This improved example provides a more comprehensive educational experience on cloning HashSets in Java.
