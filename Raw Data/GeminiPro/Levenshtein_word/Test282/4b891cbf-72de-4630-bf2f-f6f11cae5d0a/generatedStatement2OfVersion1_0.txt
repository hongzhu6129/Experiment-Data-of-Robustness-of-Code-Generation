Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Dummy Node:**  The dummy node simplifies edge cases, especially when removing the head of the list.  It ensures there's always a node before the actual head, making the removal logic consistent.

2. **`n` Greater than List Length:** Added a check within the first loop to handle cases where `n` is greater than or equal to the list length. In such scenarios, the original list is returned.

3. **Clearer Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic step by step, improving readability.

4. **Concise and Efficient:** The two-pointer approach is efficient and avoids unnecessary list iterations.


Example Usage in `main` Method:

The provided `main` method demonstrates how to create a sample linked list, call the `removeNthFromEnd` method, and print the modified list.  The output for the given example will be `1 2 3 5`.
