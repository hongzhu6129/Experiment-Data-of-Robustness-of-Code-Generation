**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes error handling for the case where the file is not found.  It prints an error message and exits gracefully using `System.exit(1)`. Returning `null` from `readWordsFromFile`  signals to `main` that there was a problem. This is crucial for robust code.

2. **Word Validation:** The code uses a regular expression `[a-zA-Z]+` to ensure that only words starting with a letter (a-z or A-Z) are added to the list.

3. **Clearer `main` Method:** The `main` method is more focused on the core logic: getting the filename, reading the words, sorting, and displaying. The file reading and word validation is handled in a separate `readWordsFromFile` method, improving readability and organization.

4. **Descending Sort:**  `Collections.sort(words, Collections.reverseOrder());` efficiently sorts the `words` list in descending alphabetical order.

5. **`display` Method:** The `display` method is used as requested to print each word.

6. **Comments:**  Comments are included to explain key parts of the code.

7. **Alternative `main`:** The code includes the alternative `main` method signature (commented out) as requested, even though having both is redundant.  You would only need one `main` method in your actual program.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DescendingWords.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:
   ```bash
   javac DescendingWords.java
   ```
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code with the text file as a command-line argument:
   ```bash
   java DescendingWords input.txt 
   ```
   Replace `input.txt` with the actual name of your text file.


Make sure the text file (`input.txt` in this example) is in the same directory as the compiled Java class file.
