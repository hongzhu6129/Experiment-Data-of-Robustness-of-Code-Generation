Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling for File Input:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle `FileNotFoundException`. This prevents the program from crashing if the specified file doesn't exist and provides a user-friendly error message.
2. **Command-Line Argument Validation:**  It checks if a filename is provided as a command-line argument.  If not, it prints usage instructions and exits gracefully.
3. **Filtering Words Starting with Letters:** Uses a regular expression `^[a-zA-Z].*` to ensure that only words starting with a letter (a-z or A-Z) are added to the list. This fulfills the requirement of the problem statement.
4. **Descending Sort:** `Collections.sort(words, Collections.reverseOrder());` sorts the `words` ArrayList in descending alphabetical order directly.
5. **Clearer `display` method:** The `display` method simply prints the word, following the provided method signature requirement.
6. **Efficiency:** Uses `ArrayList` which is generally more efficient for this type of task than `LinkedList`.



**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DescendingWords.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac DescendingWords.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code with the text file as a command-line argument: `java DescendingWords input.txt`  (Replace `input.txt` with the actual name of your text file).


This improved version addresses all the requirements of the problem statement, handles potential errors, and follows best practices for Java coding.
