Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now checks if a filename is provided as a command-line argument.  It also includes a `try-catch` block to handle `FileNotFoundException` gracefully. This makes the program more robust.

2. **Word Filtering:** It ensures that only words starting with a letter are added to the list.  This addresses the requirement "the words must start with a letter."

3. **Descending Sort:** `Collections.sort(words, Collections.reverseOrder());` sorts the `words` list in descending alphabetical order directly. This is cleaner and more efficient than implementing a custom comparator.

4. **Clearer Output:** The `display()` method is used to print each word, making the output more organized.

5. **Resource Management:**  The `Scanner` is closed automatically using try-with-resources, ensuring proper resource management.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DescendingWords.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then compile using:
