Key improvements in this version:

1. **Error Handling:**  Includes a check for the correct number of command-line arguments and handles `FileNotFoundException` gracefully.
2. **Regex for Letter Check:** Uses a regular expression `^[a-zA-Z].*` to ensure that only words starting with a letter are added to the list. This is more robust than simply checking the first character.
3. **Clearer Comments:** Added comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.
4. **Uses `ArrayList`:** Uses `ArrayList` for storing the words, which is more efficient for adding and removing elements dynamically compared to an array.
5. **`Collections.reverseOrder()`:** Uses `Collections.reverseOrder()` for a concise and efficient way to sort in descending order.


To compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DescendingWords.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then compile the code:  `javac DescendingWords.java`
3. **Run:** `java DescendingWords <your_text_file.txt>`  (Replace `<your_text_file.txt>` with the actual path to your text file).
