**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays and `null` input, returning 0 in both cases.

2. **In-Place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` method modifies the input array `nums` directly, removing duplicates in-place.  

3. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueIndex` is used to make the logic easier to follow.

4. **Efficient Approach:** The code uses a single loop to iterate through the array, making it an efficient O(n) solution.

5. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** The `main` method includes multiple test cases (including edge cases) to demonstrate the functionality and validate the correctness of the `removeDuplicates` method. 

6. **Clearer Output:** The output in the `main` method is now more descriptive, showing both the new length and the modified array (up to the new length) using `Arrays.copyOfRange`. This prevents printing the unchanged portion of the original array.



This improved version adheres to the prompt's method signature requirements, handles edge cases, provides clear explanations, and demonstrates efficient and correct functionality.
