**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays and null inputs, returning 0 in both cases.

2. **In-place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` method modifies the input array directly, as requested.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** The variable `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than a single-letter variable.

4. **Concise Logic:** The code is simplified by directly updating the array elements within the loop.

5. **Comprehensive `main` method:** The `main` method now includes multiple test cases demonstrating different scenarios, including empty and null inputs, making it easier to verify the code's behavior. 

6. **Output Formatting:** The output is formatted using `Arrays.toString` and `Arrays.copyOfRange` to neatly display the relevant part of the modified array for clarity.  The original array is also printed to show in-place modification and emphasize that the elements after the returned length are just leftovers and are not relevant anymore.
