Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` input, returning 0 as the length in both cases.

2. **Clearer Variable Naming:**  `uniqueIndex` is a more descriptive name than just `i` for the index tracking unique elements.

3. **In-Place Modification:**  The function modifies the original array `nums` directly. It moves the unique elements to the beginning of the array.  

4. **Correct Return Value:** The function returns the correct updated length (number of unique elements).

5. **Comprehensive `main` Method:**  The `main` method includes various test cases, including empty arrays, `null` input, and arrays with and without duplicates to demonstrate the correctness of the `removeDuplicates` method.  The output now also prints the modified array (the relevant portion up to the new length), which is helpful for visualization and debugging.

6. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic and purpose of the code.


This improved version provides a robust and correct solution to the problem while adhering to the specified method signatures.  It is well-documented and handles various edge cases, making it more reliable and easier to understand.
