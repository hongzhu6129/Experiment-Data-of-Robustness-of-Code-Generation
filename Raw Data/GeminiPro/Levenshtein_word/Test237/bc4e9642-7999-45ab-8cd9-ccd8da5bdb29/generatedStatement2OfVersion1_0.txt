Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `i` for tracking the unique elements.
2. **Comments and Explanations:** Added comments within the `removeDuplicates` method to explain the logic step by step. This makes the code educational.
3. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** Included multiple test cases in `main` to demonstrate how the function works with various inputs, including empty and null arrays. It also prints the modified array (the part containing the unique elements) for clarity.
4. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code explicitly handles null and empty input arrays, returning 0 in those cases. This makes the function more robust.
5. **Conciseness and Efficiency:**  The core logic remains efficient, using a single loop to achieve the desired result.  There's no unnecessary copying or creation of new arrays.
6. **Use of `Arrays.copyOfRange`:** In the `main` method, `Arrays.copyOfRange` is used to print only the relevant portion of the modified array (the unique elements), preventing the output of trailing garbage values.



This enhanced version is much more suitable as an educational example, making it easier to understand how the algorithm works and demonstrating good coding practices.
