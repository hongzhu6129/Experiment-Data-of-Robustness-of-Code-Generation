**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`isEven()` function:** This function checks if a number is even. It's now separate and more readable.

2. **`rearrange()` function:**  This function efficiently rearranges the array using a two-pointer approach. 
   - `left` pointer starts from the beginning and moves forward as long as it encounters odd (or "weird" as originally described � I assume that means not even) numbers.
   - `right` pointer starts from the end and moves backward as long as it encounters even numbers.
   - When both pointers stop (meaning `left` found an even number and `right` found an odd/weird number), they swap the elements and continue moving. This ensures all odd/weird numbers are moved to the left and even numbers to the right.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `left` and `right` as pointer names is more descriptive.

4. **Improved Efficiency:** The two-pointer approach efficiently rearranges the array in-place, minimizing unnecessary swaps.


**Example Usage in `main()`:**

The `main` method demonstrates the usage of the `rearrange()` function with a sample array. The output will show the rearranged array with weird (odd) numbers before even numbers. For the provided sample input `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 17, 21, 22, 24}` the output would be:
`[1, 17, 3, 21, 5, 13, 7, 9, 24, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 22]` (the order of odd and even numbers among themselves may vary as we are just separating odd and even, not sorting them completely).
