Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Clearer Comparator Implementation:**  The `StringComparator` now clearly shows how to implement the `compare` method. It defaults to standard string comparison (lexicographical order).  I've also included a commented-out example showing how you could sort by length first, then alphabetically, which is a common requirement.

2. **Illustrative Example:**  The `main` method populates the `TreeMap` with more sample data to demonstrate the sorting more effectively.

3. **Reverse Sorting Demonstration:** The code now shows how to easily create a `TreeMap` that sorts in reverse order using `reversed()`.

4. **Conciseness and Readability:**  The code is organized and formatted for better readability.


How to Use/Adapt:

* **Change the Sorting Logic:** Modify the `compare` method in `StringComparator` to implement any sorting criteria you need.  The commented-out example provides a good starting point for custom logic.

* **Different Value Types:** If you want to store values other than `String` in your map (e.g., integers, custom objects), simply change the second type parameter in the `TreeMap` declaration:  `TreeMap<String, Integer>`,  `TreeMap<String, YourCustomObject>`, etc.  You don't need to modify the `StringComparator` unless you are sorting based on the values as well.
