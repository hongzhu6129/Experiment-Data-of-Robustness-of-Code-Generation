This revised educational example covers:

1. **`equals()` method:**  Clearly demonstrates how it compares content and how it behaves when lists are modified.
2. **Size comparison:**  Explains the importance of checking size for a preliminary comparison.
3. **Element-by-element comparison:** Shows manual iteration for detailed control, including handling potential `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
4. **`containsAll()` method:** Explains how to use this method for checking if all elements of one list are present in the other, regardless of order and even with duplicates.  Demonstrates different scenarios with and without duplicates and with extra elements.


The output is now structured to clearly show the results of each comparison method and the impact of modifications. It also has more comments explaining the different aspects of the code and the methods being used.
