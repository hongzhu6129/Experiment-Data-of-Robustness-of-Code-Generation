To compile and run this code:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CollatzConjecture.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac CollatzConjecture.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with an integer argument like this: `java CollatzConjecture 5` (replace 5 with any positive integer you want to test).


The program will then print the sequence of numbers generated by the Collatz conjecture until it reaches 1.  It also includes error handling for invalid input (non-integers and non-positive integers).
