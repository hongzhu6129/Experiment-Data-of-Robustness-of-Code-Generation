        // 1. Specify the file path.  Make sure this path is correct for your system.

        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {

            String line;

            // 3. Read the file line by line until the end of the file is reached.
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                // 4. Add each line to the List.
                fileLines.add(line); 
            }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            // 5. Handle potential IOExceptions (e.g., file not found).
            System.err.println("Error reading the file: " + e.getMessage());
            // You might want to exit the program or take other actions here
            System.exit(1); // Exit with an error code
        }

        // 6. Now 'fileLines' contains all lines from the file. You can process them.

        // Example: Print the lines to the console:
        System.out.println("File contents:");
        for (String l : fileLines) {
            System.out.println(l);
        }


        // Example: Store the entire file content as a single String (if needed)
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for(String l : fileLines) {
            sb.append(l).append("\n"); // Append each line with a newline character
        }
        String entireFileContent = sb.toString();


        System.out.println("\nEntire file content as a single String:");
        System.out.println(entireFileContent);


    }
}
```


**Explanation and Key improvements:**

1. **Clearer file path handling:**  The `filePath` is now a variable, making it easier to change.  Emphasize the importance of providing the correct path.

2. **List for storing lines:** Uses an `ArrayList` to store each line individually, which is a common and efficient way to handle file data.

3. **Try-with-resources:** This ensures that the `BufferedReader` is closed automatically, even if exceptions occur, preventing resource leaks.

4. **Robust error handling:** The `catch` block now provides more informative error messages and exits the program gracefully with an error code if the file cannot be read.

5. **Clear comments:** The code is well-commented, explaining each step of the process.

6. **Example usage:** The code demonstrates how to print the lines and how to combine them into a single string if required.

7. **StringBuilder for concatenation:**  If you need the entire file as a single string, using `StringBuilder` is much more efficient than string concatenation using `+`.


**To use this code:**

1. **Create a text file named `my_file.txt`** (or whatever you set `filePath` to) in the same directory as your Java file (or specify the full path).
2. **Put some text in the file.**
3. **Compile and run the Java code.**  The contents of the file will be printed to the console.
