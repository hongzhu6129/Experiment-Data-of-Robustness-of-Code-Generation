```java
public class Ramanujan {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1729; //  You can change this value to search a different range.

        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            int a3 = a * a * a;
            if (a3 > n) break; // Optimization: Stop if a^3 exceeds n

            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) {  // b starts from a+1 to avoid duplicate pairs
                int b3 = b * b * b;
                if (a3 + b3 > n) break; // Optimization: Stop if a^3 + b^3 exceeds n

                for (int c = 1; c <= n; c++) {
                    int c3 = c * c * c;
                    if (c3 > n) break;

                    for (int d = c + 1; d <= n; d++) {
                        int d3 = d * d * d;
                        if (c3 + d3 > n) break;


                        if (a3 + b3 == c3 + d3 && a3 + b3 <= n && (a != c || b != d)) {
                            System.out.println(a3 + b3 + " = " + a + "^3 + " + b + "^3 = " + c + "^3 + " + d + "^3");
                            return; // Exit after finding the first such number (as per problem description)
                        }

                    }
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println("No such number found within the range 1 to " + n);



    }
}

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Efficiency:** The original nested loop structure had a time complexity close to O(n^4).  This version incorporates several optimizations to reduce redundant calculations:
   - `if (a3 > n) break;`:  Stops the loop if `a^3` exceeds `n`, as further calculations would be unnecessary.
   - `if (a3 + b3 > n) break;`: Similar optimization for the sum of cubes.
   - `b = a + 1`: Ensures that `b` is always greater than `a` to avoid duplicate pairs (e.g., 1^3 + 2^3 and 2^3 + 1^3).
   -  `return;` exits after finding the first Ramanujan number. If you want to find *all* such numbers within the range, remove this `return` statement.


2. **Clarity:** The code is more readable with better variable names and comments.

3. **Correctness:** The condition `(a != c || b != d)` is crucial. It ensures that the two pairs of cubes are genuinely different (not just the same pair in a different order).


4. **Flexibility:**  You can easily change the value of `n` to explore a different range.


**How to compile and run:**

1. Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Compile: `javac Ramanujan.java`
5. Run: `java Ramanujan`


The output for `n = 1729` will be:

```
1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3 
```
