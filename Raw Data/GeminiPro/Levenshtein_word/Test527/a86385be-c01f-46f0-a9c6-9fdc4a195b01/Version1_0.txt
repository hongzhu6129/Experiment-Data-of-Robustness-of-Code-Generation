```java
public class Ramanujan {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1729; // You can change this value

        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            int a3 = a * a * a;
            if (a3 > n) {
                break; // Optimization: No need to check further if a^3 exceeds n
            }

            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) { // Start b from a+1 to avoid duplicates
                int b3 = b * b * b;
                if (a3 + b3 > n) {
                    break; // Optimization: No need to check further if a^3 + b^3 exceeds n
                }

                for (int c = a + 1; c <= n; c++) { // Again, start c from a+1
                    int c3 = c * c * c;
                    if (c3 > n) {
                        break;
                    }

                    for (int d = c + 1; d <= n; d++) {
                        int d3 = d * d * d;

                        if (a3 + b3 == c3 + d3 && a3 + b3 <= n) {
                            System.out.println(a3 + b3 + " = " + a + "^3 + " + b + "^3 = " + c + "^3 + " + d + "^3");
                            return; // Exit after finding the first such number.  Remove this line to find all numbers up to n.
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println("No such number found up to " + n); // Print this if no such number is found.

    }
}
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Efficiency:** The code includes several optimizations:
   - It breaks out of loops early if `a^3`, `a^3 + b^3`, or `c^3` exceeds `n`, as there's no point in continuing.
   - `b` starts from `a + 1` and `d` starts from `c + 1` to avoid duplicate pairs and ensure that `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` are distinct.

2. **Clarity:** The variable names (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `a3`, `b3`, etc.) are more descriptive than the original example.

3. **Flexibility:** You can easily change the value of `n` to search within a different range.

4. **Complete Solution:** The code now includes a message to indicate if no such number is found within the given range.

5. **Early Exit (Optional):** The `return;` statement exits the program after finding the *first* such number. If you want to find *all* such numbers up to `n`, you can remove the `return;` statement.



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type:
   ```bash
   javac Ramanujan.java
   ```
3. **Run:**
   ```bash
   java Ramanujan 
   ```


This will print the first number (1729 by default) that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.  If you change `n` to a larger value (e.g., 4104) and remove the `return;`, you will see more results.
