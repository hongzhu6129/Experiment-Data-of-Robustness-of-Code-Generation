Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  Explicitly handles `null` and empty input arrays.
- **Clearer comments:** Explains the logic and reasoning behind the code.
- **More comprehensive testing:** Includes test cases for various scenarios, including edge cases.
- **Uses HashMap efficiently:** Uses a HashMap to store cumulative sums for quick lookup.
- **Returns an empty list:**  If no subarray with a sum of zero is found, returns an empty list instead of `null` to avoid potential `NullPointerExceptions`.
- **Improved output:**  Prints the results in a more user-friendly way.
