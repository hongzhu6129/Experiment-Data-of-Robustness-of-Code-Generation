Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles command-line arguments:**  The user can optionally provide the year and month as command-line arguments. This makes the program more flexible.
* **Error handling:** The code now includes `try-catch` blocks to handle potential `NumberFormatException` (if the user enters non-numeric input) and `IllegalArgumentException` (if an invalid month number is entered).
* **Clearer output:** The output is organized with section headings and descriptive labels.
* **Leap year handling:** The `YearMonth` class is used to correctly calculate the number of days in the month, taking leap years into account.
* **Flexibility:** The `printMonthInfo` method makes it easy to add or modify the information that's printed about the month.


How to compile and run (with command-line arguments):

1. **Save:** Save the code as `GetMonthInfo.java`.
2. **Compile:** `javac GetMonthInfo.java`
3. **Run:** `java GetMonthInfo 2025 3`  (This will get information for March 2025).  Or run `java GetMonthInfo` without arguments for the current month.
