public class LeastKeyGreaterThanOrEqualTo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage:
        TreeMap<Integer, String> treeMap = new TreeMap<>();
        treeMap.put(10, "Ten");
        treeMap.put(20, "Twenty");
        treeMap.put(30, "Thirty");
        treeMap.put(40, "Forty");
        treeMap.put(50, "Fifty");

        int key1 = 25;
        Integer result1 = treeMap.ceilingKey(key1);
        System.out.println("Least key greater than or equal to " + key1 + ": " + result1); // Output: 30

        int key2 = 55;
        Integer result2 = treeMap.ceilingKey(key2); 
        System.out.println("Least key greater than or equal to " + key2 + ": " + result2); // Output: null

        int key3 = 30;
        Integer result3 = treeMap.ceilingKey(key3);
        System.out.println("Least key greater than or equal to " + key3 + ": " + result3); // Output: 30


         // Example with String keys (you'd need to adjust comparisons if needed):
        TreeMap<String, Integer> stringTreeMap = new TreeMap<>();
        stringTreeMap.put("apple", 1);
        stringTreeMap.put("banana", 2);
        stringTreeMap.put("cherry", 3);

        String key4 = "blueberry";
        String result4 = stringTreeMap.ceilingKey(key4); // Comparison is based on String's natural ordering
        System.out.println("Least key greater than or equal to " + key4 + ": " + result4); // Output: cherry

Explanation within `main` method limitations:

1. **TreeMap:** We use a `TreeMap` because it automatically stores keys in sorted order, making it efficient to find the least key greater than or equal to a given key.

2. **ceilingKey():**  The `ceilingKey()` method of `TreeMap` directly does what we need.  It returns the least key greater than or equal to the given key, or `null` if there's no such key.

3. **Example:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to create a `TreeMap`, add elements, and use `ceilingKey()` to get the desired result.  The different examples show how it handles various cases, including when the exact key exists, when a larger key exists, and when no larger key exists.

4. **String Keys:**  The example with `stringTreeMap` shows that `TreeMap` can handle String keys as well (or any other comparable type).  The comparison will be based on the natural ordering of Strings (lexicographical order).


Important Notes due to `main` method restriction:

* Error handling (e.g., for invalid input) is minimal in this example for brevity. In a more complete program, you would typically include more robust error handling.
*  More complex scenarios (e.g., handling custom comparison logic) would typically be handled by separate classes/methods, which is not possible within a single `main` method.
