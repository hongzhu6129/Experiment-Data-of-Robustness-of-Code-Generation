Key improvements in this revised code:

- **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and null arrays without throwing exceptions.  This is crucial for robust code.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` more accurately describes its purpose.
- **Improved comments:** The comments explain the logic more effectively.
- **Comprehensive testing in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates various scenarios, including normal cases, an empty array, and a `null` array, making it easier to verify the code's behavior.
- **Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`:** In the `main` method, when printing the modified array, it's now using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to only print the relevant portion of the array (up to the new length). This avoids printing the "garbage" values that are still technically present in the original array after the new length.



This version adheres to the prompt's restrictions (using only the specified method signatures) while providing a correct and robust solution.
