**Test Cases:**

**1. Basic Case:**
   - Input: 1, 2, 3
   - Expected Output:  123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321 (Count: 6)

**2. Repeated Digits:**
   - Input: 1, 1, 2
   - Expected Output: 112, 121, 211 (Count: 3)


**3.  Single Digit Repeated Thrice:**
   - Input: 3, 3, 3
   - Expected Output: 333 (Count: 1)



**4. Using 0:**  (Corner Case)
   - Input: 0, 1, 2
   - Expected Output: 102, 120, 201, 210, 12, 21 are rejected because they're not 3-digit numbers. (Count: 4, because we exclude numbers like 012 and 021, which are effectively 2-digit numbers)


**5. Fewer than 3 Digits:** (Corner Case �  Will be handled by the revised code)
   - Input: 1, 2
   - Expected Output:  (Count: 0 � No three-digit numbers can be formed)


**6. More than 3 Digits:** (Not applicable as per the problem statement, the program assumes exactly 3 digits are provided as specified in the prompt).



**7. Using Larger Digits:**
   - Input: 7, 8, 9
   - Expected Output: 789, 798, 879, 897, 978, 987 (Count: 6)





This improved version with test cases addresses potential issues and clarifies expected behavior for corner cases.  The key improvement is explicitly checking that generated numbers are indeed three-digit numbers before adding them to the set, thus correctly handling cases involving the digit 0.
