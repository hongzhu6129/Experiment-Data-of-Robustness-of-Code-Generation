                , "/home/students/large_file.txt" // A potentially very large file (handle potential overflow)

             if (largeFile.createNewFile()) {
                 System.out.println("File created: " + largeFile.getAbsolutePath());
             } else {
                 System.out.println("File already exists.");
             }


         } catch (Exception e) {

**Test Cases:**

1. **Existing Empty File:**  `/home/students/abc.txt` (0 bytes) - Verifies the function correctly handles empty files.
2. **Non-existent File:** `nonexistent_file.txt` - Checks the handling of files that do not exist.  The function should return -1.
3. **Directory:** `/path/to/a/directory` -  Tests that the function distinguishes between files and directories and returns -1 for a directory.
4. **Empty File Path:** `""` - Tests behavior with an empty string as the file path. Should return -1 (invalid path).
5. **Null File Path:**  `null` -  Tests how the function handles a null argument (should handle gracefully and return -1).
6. **Large File (Potential Overflow):** `/home/students/large_file.txt` - Create a very large file (e.g., > 2GB) to test that the `file.length()` method, which returns a `long`, doesn't overflow or produce incorrect results.
7. **File with Spaces in Path:** `/home/students/file with spaces.txt` (Create this file) -  Tests handling file paths containing spaces.


**Key Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:**  The code now returns -1 if the file doesn't exist or is not a regular file (e.g., a directory), providing more robust error handling.
* **Clearer Output:** Improved output messages indicate when a file is not found or is not a file.
* **Handles `null` Input:** Added a check for `null` input to prevent `NullPointerException`.
* **Large File Handling:** Using `long` ensures the code can handle very large files without integer overflow.
* **Test File Creation:** The code includes an example of how to create a test file (large_file.txt) for testing the large file scenario.  You can adjust the size of the test file as needed.  The `try...catch` block ensures robust error handling during file creation.


**To Run the Code:**

1. Save the code as `FileSize.java`.
2. Compile: `javac FileSize.java`
3. Run: `java FileSize`


Remember to create the test files (including a large one) in the specified locations or adjust the file paths in the test cases accordingly. Also, replace `/home/students/` with appropriate paths relevant to your system.
