2. **Negative Number Handling:** The `isCube` method now correctly handles negative numbers.  The cube of a negative number is negative, so we just check the absolute value.


3. **Efficient Cube Root Calculation and Comparison:** Instead of looping or using `Math.pow()`, we use `Math.cbrt()` (cube root) which is a more direct and efficient approach. Casting the result to `int` effectively rounds down to the nearest integer, which is what we want for the comparison.


4. **Clearer Output:** The output messages are more informative.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CubeChecker.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile:
