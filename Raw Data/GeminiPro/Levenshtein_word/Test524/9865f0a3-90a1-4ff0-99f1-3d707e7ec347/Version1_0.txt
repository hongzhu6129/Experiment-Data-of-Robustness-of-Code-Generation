                return; // Exit after finding a match
            } else if (honeycomb > num) {
                System.out.println("Number is not a honeycomb.");

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Honeycomb Number Definition:** Honeycomb numbers are defined by the formula  `n^3 - (n-1)^3`.  The provided prompt incorrectly referred to cube numbers (n*n*n).  This code uses the correct honeycomb formula.

2. **Efficient Check:** The code efficiently checks for honeycomb numbers by iterating through possible 'n' values.  It calculates the honeycomb number for each 'n' and compares it with the input.

3. **Early Exit:**  The code includes early exit conditions:
   - If a match is found, the program prints "Number is a honeycomb." and immediately exits using `return;`.
   - If the calculated honeycomb number becomes greater than the input `num`, it means the input is not a honeycomb number, so it prints "Number is not a honeycomb." and exits. This prevents unnecessary calculations.

4. **Clear Output:** The output messages clearly state whether the input number is a honeycomb number or not.

5. **User Input:** The code uses `Scanner` to take user input, making it interactive.

**Example Usage:**

```
Input a number: 7
Number is not a honeycomb.


Input a number: 19
Number is a honeycomb.  // Because 3^3 - 2^3 = 27 - 8 = 19

Input a number: 37
Number is a honeycomb.  // Because 4^3 - 3^3 = 64 - 27 = 37
```
