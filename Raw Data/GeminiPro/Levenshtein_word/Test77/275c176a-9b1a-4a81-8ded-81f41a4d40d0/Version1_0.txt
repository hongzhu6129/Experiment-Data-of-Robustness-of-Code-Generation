```java
public class SystemInfoAndSecurityManager {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // 4. Get current system environment and system properties
        System.out.println("System Environment:");
        java.util.Map<String, String> env = System.getenv();
        for (String envName : env.keySet()) {
            System.out.format("%s=%s%n", envName, env.get(envName));
        }

        System.out.println("\nSystem Properties:");
        java.util.Properties props = System.getProperties();
        props.list(System.out);


        // 89. Check if a security manager is established
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            System.out.println("\nA security manager has already been established.");
            // Example:  Try something that might be restricted
            try {
                System.exit(0); // Just an example, don't actually exit in real code unless intended!
            } catch (SecurityException e) {
                System.out.println("Caught SecurityException: " + e.getMessage()); 
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("\nA security manager has not been established.");
        }
    }
}
```


Key improvements in this code:

* **Clearer Output:**  The output is formatted with descriptive labels ("System Environment", "System Properties") and newlines to make it easier to read.
* **Security Manager Check with Example:**  The code not only checks for the presence of a `SecurityManager` but also includes a simple example (attempting `System.exit()`) to demonstrate how a `SecurityException` might be caught if a security manager is active and restricts certain actions.
* **Conciseness and Efficiency:** The code remains concise and focused while providing comprehensive information about the system environment, properties, and security manager status.
* **Correctness:** The code accurately addresses both problem requests (4 and 89) within a single `main` method.


How to run the code:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SystemInfoAndSecurityManager.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac SystemInfoAndSecurityManager.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java SystemInfoAndSecurityManager`


To test the security manager aspect more thoroughly, you would need to configure a security policy file and run Java with appropriate options to enable the security manager and enforce the policy.  The provided example with `System.exit()` gives a basic illustration of how a security manager might be used to restrict certain actions.
