Key improvements in this code:

* **Clearer Output:**  The output is formatted with descriptive labels ("System Environment", "System Properties") and newlines to make it easier to read.
* **Security Manager Check with Example:**  The code not only checks for the presence of a `SecurityManager` but also includes a simple example (attempting `System.exit()`) to demonstrate how a `SecurityException` might be caught if a security manager is active and restricts certain actions.
* **Conciseness and Efficiency:** The code remains concise and focused while providing comprehensive information about the system environment, properties, and security manager status.
* **Correctness:** The code accurately addresses both problem requests (4 and 89) within a single `main` method.


How to run the code:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SystemInfoAndSecurityManager.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac SystemInfoAndSecurityManager.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java SystemInfoAndSecurityManager`


To test the security manager aspect more thoroughly, you would need to configure a security policy file and run Java with appropriate options to enable the security manager and enforce the policy.  The provided example with `System.exit()` gives a basic illustration of how a security manager might be used to restrict certain actions.
