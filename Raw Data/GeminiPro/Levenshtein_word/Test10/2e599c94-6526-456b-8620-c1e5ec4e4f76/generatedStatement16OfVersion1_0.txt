**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Input Validation:**  The code now handles invalid input sizes (less than 3) gracefully by printing an error message and returning. This prevents unexpected behavior or crashes.
* **Clearer Eye and Nose Placement:** The logic for placing the eyes and nose is more robust and handles both odd and even sizes correctly. The eyes and nose are always centrally placed.
* **Helper Function:**  The `printHorizontalLine` function is used to reduce code duplication and improve readability.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The test cases cover various scenarios, including valid sizes, invalid sizes, odd sizes, even sizes, and larger sizes, ensuring that the function works correctly under different conditions.


This improved version addresses the potential issues and provides a more reliable and versatile solution for printing faces of various sizes.
