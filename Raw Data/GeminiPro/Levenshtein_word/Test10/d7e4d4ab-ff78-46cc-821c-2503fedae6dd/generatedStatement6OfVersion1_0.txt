4. **No Input:** This program doesn't take any command-line arguments, so you don't need to test with different inputs.

5. **Corner Cases:**  This program doesn't have traditional corner cases because it's just printing static output. The closest thing to corner cases are the character encoding and output redirection aspects mentioned above. If you were to modify this program to take the face features as input, then you'd have more corner cases to consider (e.g., empty strings, invalid characters, etc.).


**Example using JUnit for demonstration (although more complex than necessary for this simple program):**
