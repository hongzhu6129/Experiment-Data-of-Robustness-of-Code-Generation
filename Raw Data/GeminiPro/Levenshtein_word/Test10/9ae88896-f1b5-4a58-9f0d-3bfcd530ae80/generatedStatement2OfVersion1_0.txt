**Test Cases:**

Since this program doesn't take any input, the testing focuses on verifying the correct output.  "Corner cases" in this context are less about input values and more about ensuring the output format is maintained across different environments (e.g., different operating systems, console sizes).  Traditional unit testing isn't as applicable here as with programs that process data.  The primary testing approach would be visual inspection.

1. **Standard Output:**  Run the program and visually verify the output matches the expected face.  Check for correct spacing and characters.

2. **Output Redirection:** Redirect the output to a file to ensure the characters and formatting are preserved.  This helps test for potential issues related to character encoding or platform-specific newline characters.
