**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Invalid Input:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to gracefully handle invalid octal numbers (like those containing characters other than 0-7) or numbers that are too large to fit into a `long`. It prints an appropriate error message.

2. **Handles Zero:** The code explicitly handles the corner case of an input of "0".

3. **Handles Negative Octal:**  Added logic to handle negative octal representations (prefixed with '-').

4. **No External Methods:**  Strictly adheres to the requirement of using only the `main` method.

5. **Clearer Error Handling:** The error messages are more informative, indicating the specific issue encountered.

6. **Test Cases:** The test cases cover a wider range of scenarios, including valid octal numbers of different lengths, zero, an invalid octal number with characters outside the 0-7 range, large octal number, and negative octal numbers.  These test cases help demonstrate the robustness of the improved code.





**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `OctalToDecimal.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Compile the code using the Java compiler: `javac OctalToDecimal.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java OctalToDecimal`


The output will display the decimal equivalents of the octal numbers provided in the test cases, or an appropriate error message for invalid inputs.
