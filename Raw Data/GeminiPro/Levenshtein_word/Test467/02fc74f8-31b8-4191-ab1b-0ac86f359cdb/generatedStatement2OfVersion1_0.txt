Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Input Validation:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle `DateTimeParseException`. This prevents the program from crashing if the user enters an invalid date format.  It provides a helpful error message.

2. **Clear Prompts:** User-friendly prompts guide the user to input dates in the correct format.

3. **ISO 8601 Date Format:** The code uses `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE` to parse dates. This ensures consistent and reliable date handling.  ISO 8601 (yyyy-MM-dd) is the recommended format for date strings.

4. **LocalDate and Period:** The `java.time` package (introduced in Java 8) provides modern and efficient date/time handling. `LocalDate` represents a date without time, and `Period` calculates the difference between two dates.


How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DateDifference.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:
