```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class FirstUniqueChar {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "wresource";
        int index = first_Uniq_Char(str);
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("First unique character of the above: " + index);


        str = "aabbccddeeffg"; // Example with a unique character later in the string
        index = first_Uniq_Char(str);
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("First unique character of the above: " + index);

        str = "loveleetcode"; // Example from LeetCode
        index = first_Uniq_Char(str);
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("First unique character of the above: " + index);


    }

    public static int first_Uniq_Char(String s) {
        // Use a HashMap to store character counts
        Map<Character, Integer> charCounts = new HashMap<>();

        // Count the occurrences of each character
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            charCounts.put(c, charCounts.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Find the first character with a count of 1
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (charCounts.get(s.charAt(i)) == 1) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        // This should not be reached if the assumption (at least one unique character) holds.
        return -1; 
    }
}
```


Output:

```
Original String: wresource
First unique character of the above: 0
Original String: aabbccddeeffg
First unique character of the above: 12
Original String: loveleetcode
First unique character of the above: 2
```


Key improvements:

* **HashMap for Efficiency:** Using a `HashMap` to store character counts significantly improves the efficiency of finding unique characters compared to nested loops. Lookups in a `HashMap` are typically O(1) on average.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  More descriptive variable names like `charCounts` improve readability.
* **Handles Edge Cases:**  While the problem states there's always a unique character, the code now returns `-1` if, for some reason, no unique character is found. This makes the function more robust.
* **Added Test Cases:** Included additional examples to demonstrate the code's functionality with different string inputs.  This is always good practice.
* **Conciseness:** The code is now more concise and avoids unnecessary steps.
