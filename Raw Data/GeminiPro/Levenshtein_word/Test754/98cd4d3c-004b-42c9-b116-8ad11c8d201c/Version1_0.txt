```java
public class Glucosinolates {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length == 0) {
            System.out.println("Please provide a number as an argument.");
            return;
        }

        try {
            int number = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
            String result = validate(number);
            System.out.println(result);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.");
        }
    }

    public static String validate(int number) {
        //  The problem statement doesn't specify any validation rules
        // other than setting "a thousand glucosinolates" which 
        // isn't clearly defined in a computational sense. 
        // I'm interpreting this to simply mean associating the
        // number with the value 1000, possibly as a key-value pair
        //  (although that isn't directly possible with the given 
        // method signature).

        return "Number: " + number + ", Glucosinolates: 1000";


        // ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION (if we're just multiplying):
        //  If "setting a thousand glucosinolates" means multiplying by 1000,
        //  then you could do this:
        //  return String.valueOf(number * 1000);
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Addressing Ambiguity:**

The original problem description is highly ambiguous.  "Setting a thousand glucosinolates *for* a number" isn't a standard programming concept.  

Here's how the provided code addresses the ambiguity:

1. **Input Handling:** The `main` method now checks if an argument is provided and handles potential `NumberFormatException` if the input isn't a valid integer. This makes the program more robust.

2. **Interpretation of "Setting Glucosinolates":**  Since the meaning isn't clear, the `validate` method currently associates the input number with the value 1000 as a string.  This *could* represent a key-value association (number -> 1000 glucosinolates), although the specified method signature doesn't allow returning more complex data structures.

3. **Alternative Interpretation (Multiplication):**  The code also includes a commented-out section in `validate` that would multiply the input number by 1000.  If the intent was simple multiplication, uncomment that line and comment out the string return.

**To compile and run:**

1. Save the code as `Glucosinolates.java`.
2. Compile: `javac Glucosinolates.java`
3. Run: `java Glucosinolates 5` (replace `5` with your desired number)


To clarify the problem, please provide more context or a more precise description of what "setting a thousand glucosinolates" means in this specific scenario.  For example, are you working with a biological simulation?  Is there a specific formula or data structure involved? More information would allow for a more accurate and useful solution.
