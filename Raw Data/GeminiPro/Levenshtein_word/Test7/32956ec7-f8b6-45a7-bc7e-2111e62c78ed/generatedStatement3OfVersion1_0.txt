By using a testing framework, you can automate the testing process and easily run your tests whenever you make changes to your code. This helps ensure the correctness of your program over time.  Be sure to include tests for the input mismatch exception.  You would need to modify the above JUnit to test that case.  It could be done by calling the main method and checking the System.err for the expected message.  That approach is a bit more complex, so I did not include it here.
