```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AverageCalculator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter three numbers:");

        try {
            double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();
            double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();
            double num3 = scanner.nextDouble();

            double average = calculateAverage(num1, num2, num3);

            System.out.println("The average is: " + average);

        } catch (java.util.InputMismatchException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.");
        } finally {
            scanner.close(); // Close the scanner in the finally block to ensure it's always closed
        }
    }


    public static double calculateAverage(double num1, double num2, double num3) {
        return (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering normal scenarios and corner cases:

| Test Case | Input (num1, num2, num3) | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10, 20, 30 | 20.0 | Basic positive numbers |
| 2 | -5, 0, 5 | 0.0 | Includes negative and zero |
| 3 | 0, 0, 0 | 0.0 | All zeros |
| 4 | 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 | 2.5 | Decimal numbers |
| 5 | Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE |  Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY | Positive overflow (Java handles this gracefully with doubles) |
| 6 | Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE | Integer.MIN_VALUE (converted to double) |  Negative overflow (handled in doubles) |
| 7 | Double.MAX_VALUE, Double.MAX_VALUE, 0 | Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY | Overflow with doubles (Java handles this gracefully with doubles, resulting in Infinity) |
| 8 | Double.NaN, 1, 2 | NaN | Input with NaN results in NaN|
| 9 | 1, Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY, 2 | Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY | Infinity in input leads to Infinity in output |
| 10 | "a", 2, 3 | "Invalid input. Please enter numbers only." | Invalid input (non-numeric characters) � The program handles this gracefully.  |



**How to run the tests (Manually):**

1.  **Compile:** Save the code as `AverageCalculator.java` and compile it: `javac AverageCalculator.java`
2.  **Run:**  `java AverageCalculator`
3.  Enter the input values as prompted.  Compare the program's output with the expected output in the test case table.


**Improving Testability (using JUnit):**

For more robust testing, especially in larger projects, it's highly recommended to use a testing framework like JUnit. Here's an example of how you could write a JUnit test for the `calculateAverage` method:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class AverageCalculatorTest {

    @Test
    void testCalculateAveragePositive() {
        assertEquals(20.0, AverageCalculator.calculateAverage(10, 20, 30));
    }

    @Test
    void testCalculateAverageZero() {
        assertEquals(0.0, AverageCalculator.calculateAverage(0, 0, 0));
    }
      // Add more JUnit test cases here covering the corner cases (NaN, Infinity, overflows, etc.) 
}
```

With JUnit, you can automate the running of your tests and easily verify the results.  This is a much more efficient and reliable way to test your code, especially as your project grows.  You can also generate reports of your tests to track code coverage.
