This JUnit example shows how to create automated tests. You'll need to add the JUnit library to your project to use it.  This allows you to easily run your tests repeatedly and ensures the correctness of your code. Using `assertEquals` with doubles requires some caution due to potential floating-point inaccuracies, so you may sometimes use `assertEquals` with a `delta` argument (a tolerance for small differences).


Key improvements in this code and explanation:

* **Explicitly divides by `3.0`:** This ensures floating-point division, which is essential for accuracy with decimal inputs.
* **Uses `Scanner.nextDouble()`:** Correctly handles decimal inputs.
* **Includes comprehensive test cases:** Covers various scenarios including corner/edge cases.
* **Introduces JUnit testing:** Provides a more robust way to test the code.  JUnit is highly recommended for any serious Java development.
