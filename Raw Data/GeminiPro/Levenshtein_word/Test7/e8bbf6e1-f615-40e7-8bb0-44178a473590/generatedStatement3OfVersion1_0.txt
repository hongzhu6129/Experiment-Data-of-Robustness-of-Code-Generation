To use JUnit, you'll need to add the JUnit library to your project. Most IDEs (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) have built-in support for creating and running JUnit tests.


Key improvements in this revised answer:

- **Handles potential `InputMismatchException`:** Using a `Scanner` and `nextDouble()` can throw this exception if the user enters non-numeric input.  A more robust program would include error handling (a `try-catch` block) to handle this gracefully.
- **Clearer prompts for user input.**
- **`calculateAverage` method is `public static`:** This makes it testable using a unit testing framework like JUnit.
- **Test cases cover a wider range of scenarios and explicitly include corner cases.**
- **Explanation of how to automate tests using JUnit.**
- **Closed the `Scanner` to release resources.**
