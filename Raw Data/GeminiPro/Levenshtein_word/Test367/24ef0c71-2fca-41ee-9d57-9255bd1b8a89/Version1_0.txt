Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Character Counting Array:**  Uses `count[]` to efficiently track the smaller characters encountered so far.  This array has a size of 256 to handle all ASCII characters.  It's initialized with zeros.

2. **Cumulative Counts:**  The code calculates cumulative counts in the `count` array.  `count[i]` stores the number of characters less than or equal to character `i` encountered up to that point in the string.  This is crucial for efficient rank calculation.

3. **Factorial Calculation:** The `makefactorial()` method now calculates factorials iteratively, which is more efficient than recursion for larger numbers.

4. **Rank Calculation Loop:** The main logic resides in the loop within `calcuLexicoRank()`.
   - `mul` is initialized with the factorial of the string length and then divided by `(n-i)` in each iteration to avoid repeated factorial calculations.
   - The rank is updated by adding `count[str.charAt(i) - 1] * mul`.  This is the core of the lexicographic rank calculation.
   - The counts of the current character and all subsequent characters are decremented after processing the current character.

5. **Handling Duplicates (Improved):** This version handles duplicate characters correctly.  The cumulative counting and decrementing logic ensures accurate rank calculation even with repeated characters.

6. **Clarity and Comments:** Added more comments to explain the logic clearly.

7. **Example Usage in `main()`:**  Includes multiple examples to demonstrate how to use the `calcuLexicoRank()` method and its correct output.


This improved code is more efficient, handles duplicates correctly, and is better documented.
