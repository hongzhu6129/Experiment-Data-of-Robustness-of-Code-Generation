Explanation and improvements over a simpler approach:

1. **Handles different file lengths:** The code correctly compares files even if they have different numbers of lines. A simpler `compareTo()` on the entire file content wouldn't work as intended.
2. **Line-by-line comparison:** It efficiently compares the files line by line,  stopping as soon as a difference is found.
3. **Clear output:**  It provides specific output messages indicating which file comes first lexicographically or if they are equal.
4. **Error handling:** The `try-with-resources` block ensures that file readers are closed properly, and the `catch` block handles potential `IOExceptions`.
5. **Command-line arguments:** It takes the file names as command-line arguments, making it more flexible.
6. **Uses `compareTo()`:** Leverages the built-in `String.compareTo()` method for accurate lexicographical comparison.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CompareFilesLexicographically.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac CompareFilesLexicographically.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code with the file names as arguments:  `java CompareFilesLexicographically file1.txt file2.txt` (Replace `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` with the actual file paths.)
