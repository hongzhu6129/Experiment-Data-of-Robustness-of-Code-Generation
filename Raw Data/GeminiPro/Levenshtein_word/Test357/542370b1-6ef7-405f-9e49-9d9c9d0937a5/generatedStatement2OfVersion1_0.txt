Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Includes checks for `null` or empty input strings and cases where the string cannot be divided equally.
* **Clearer output:**  Prints messages to indicate what's happening and when a string can't be split evenly.
* **Multiple examples in `main`:** Shows the function working with different inputs and demonstrates the error handling.
* **No unnecessary calculations or variables:** Simplifies the logic and improves readability.


This revised code adheres to the specified method signatures and addresses potential issues with more robust handling of various input scenarios.
