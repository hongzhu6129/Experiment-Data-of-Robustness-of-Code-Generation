Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Name and Javadoc:** The method `count_nums_not_7` now has a more descriptive name and a Javadoc comment explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.  This improves readability and understanding.

2. **Helper Function:** The `containsDigit7` helper function is introduced to encapsulate the logic of checking for the digit 7 within a number. This makes the `count_nums_not_7` function cleaner and easier to follow.

3. **Main Method with Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `count_nums_not_7` function with a couple of example inputs.  This makes it easier to test and verify the functionality.

4. **Efficiency (Minor):**  While the core logic remains the same (iterating and checking each number), extracting the digit-checking logic into a separate helper function might provide a very minor performance benefit due to better code organization.  For very large values of `n`, a more mathematically sophisticated approach would be required for significant performance gains.
