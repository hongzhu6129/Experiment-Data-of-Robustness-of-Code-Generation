Key Improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:** The code now correctly handles cases where 10 is not found in the original array, or where 10 is the last element. In these cases, an appropriate message is printed, and an empty array is effectively returned (by not creating one and exiting or by explicitly stating the new array is empty).

* **Clearer explanation:**  Added comments to make the logic easier to follow, especially regarding the calculation of the new array's size and the population loop.

* **Improved output:** The printing of the new array now provides better formatting and clarity.


Example Usages and Outputs:


* **Original Array:**  `{1, 5, 10, 12, 3, 7, 10, 8, 9, 2}`
* **Output:** `New array: 8 9 2 `

* **Original Array:** `{1, 2, 3}`
* **Output:** `10 not found in the original array. New array is empty.`

* **Original Array:** `{1, 2, 10}`
* **Output:** `10 is the last element. New array is empty.`


This improved version provides a more robust and understandable solution to the problem.
