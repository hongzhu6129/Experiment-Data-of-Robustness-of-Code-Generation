Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `n` and `x` clearly represent the number of terms and the exponent.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic and purpose of the code.
* **Efficiency:** The calculation of the factorial is integrated into the main loop, avoiding redundant calculations and making the code more efficient.  The `term` is built up iteratively, which is more efficient than calculating the factorial and power separately.
* **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the function and prints the results.
* **Floating-Point Type:** Uses `float` as specified in the method signature, which is usually sufficient for this kind of calculation unless very high precision is required.  If higher precision is needed, you could use `double`.
* **Handles Negative Exponents:** Works correctly for negative exponents.
* **Initial Value of Sum:**  Initialized `sum` to 1.0f to represent the first term of the Taylor series (x^0/0! = 1).
