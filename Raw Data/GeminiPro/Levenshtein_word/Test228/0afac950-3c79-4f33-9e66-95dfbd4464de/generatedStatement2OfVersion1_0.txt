Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Empty and Null Arrays:**  The code now explicitly checks for `null` and empty arrays and returns 0 in those cases, preventing potential `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. **Clearer Variable Naming:**  `uniqueIndex` is a more descriptive name than just `j`, making the code easier to understand.

3. **Optimized Logic:** The loop starts from index 1 because the first element is always unique initially.

4. **Return Value:** The function correctly returns the new length of the unique elements portion of the array, which is `uniqueIndex + 1`.

5. **Main Method Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates the usage of the `removeDuplicates` function with a few different examples, including empty and null arrays, and clearly shows the result using `Arrays.toString` on the relevant subarray.  This makes testing and understanding the output easier.

6. **Handles Edge Cases:** By checking for null or empty arrays first, the code avoids potential exceptions and is more robust.

7. **copyOfRange for Output:**  The `main` method uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`  to only print the relevant, updated part of the array after duplicate removal, making the output clearer.  This is important because the original array is modified in-place, but the elements beyond the `uniqueIndex` are not relevant to the result.
