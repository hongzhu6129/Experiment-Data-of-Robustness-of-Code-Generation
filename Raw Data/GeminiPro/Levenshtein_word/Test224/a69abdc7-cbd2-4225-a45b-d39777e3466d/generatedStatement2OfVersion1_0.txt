Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Explicitly handles empty (`{}`) and null arrays.
* **Clearer output:** Uses `Arrays.toString` and `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print the updated array (containing only the unique elements) for easier verification.
* **More test cases:** Added more examples in `main` to demonstrate the behavior with various inputs.
* **In-place modification:** Modifies the original `nums` array directly, as per the common convention for this type of problem (though only the initial portion up to `uniqueCount` is valid).


The `removeDuplicates` function efficiently removes duplicates in-place (meaning it directly modifies the input array without creating a new one) and returns the count of unique elements.  The `main` method demonstrates how to use it and print the results clearly.
