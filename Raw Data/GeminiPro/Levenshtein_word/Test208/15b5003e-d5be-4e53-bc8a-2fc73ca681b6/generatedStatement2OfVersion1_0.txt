**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Node Class:** A `Node` class is defined to represent the structure of a ternary tree node, containing data and pointers to left, middle, and right children.

2. **Recursive `maxDepth` Method:** This method efficiently calculates the maximum depth using recursion.
   - **Base Case:** If the node is `null` (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  It recursively calculates the depths of the left, middle, and right subtrees.  Then, it returns the maximum of these depths + 1 (to account for the current node).

3. **`main` Method with Example:**
   - A sample ternary tree is created to demonstrate the usage of the `maxDepth` method.
   - The output clearly shows the calculated maximum depth.

4. **Clearer Code Style:** The code is formatted for improved readability, with comments explaining the logic.

5. **Optional Test Cases:**  I've included commented-out test cases (empty tree, single-node tree, deeper left subtree) for you to easily uncomment and test more scenarios.  This helps ensure your code handles different situations correctly.


This improved version provides a robust and understandable solution to the problem. The recursive approach is efficient and elegant for tree traversal problems like finding maximum depth.
