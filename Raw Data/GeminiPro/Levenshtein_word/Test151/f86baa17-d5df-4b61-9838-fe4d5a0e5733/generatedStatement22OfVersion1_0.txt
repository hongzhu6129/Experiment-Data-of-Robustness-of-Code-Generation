**Corner Cases:**

* **Empty input:** The program should handle the case of an empty input string by printing an empty string.
* **Single word input:** The program should reverse the order of a single word input.
* **Input with leading/trailing whitespace:** The program should ignore leading and trailing whitespace in the input string.
