Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Clarity and Correctness:**  Directly sets the time components to their minimum values (usually 0). This is more explicit and avoids potential issues with `getActualMinimum()` which could have varying results for time fields depending on locale.
* **Complete Example:**  The code now includes outputting the minimum year, month, day, week, and time components, along with an example of getting the full minimum date as a `Date` object.
* **Explanations:** Added more comments explaining some of the Calendar class nuances, such as the month being 0-indexed and the potential variability of week and day of the week.


Important Note about Week of Year and Day of Week:

The `WEEK_OF_YEAR` and `DAY_OF_WEEK` are highly dependent on locale and calendar settings (e.g., first day of the week). Their minimum values might not always be 1.  The output for these fields can vary.  Refer to the Java documentation for `Calendar` for more details on how these are calculated.
