import java.util.GregorianCalendar;

public class MinimumCalendarValues {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get a Calendar instance (default is current time)
        Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar();

        // Go to the previous date/time
        calendar.add(Calendar.DATE, -1); // or any other field like YEAR, MONTH, WEEK_OF_YEAR

        // Get minimum values using getMinimum()
        int minYear = calendar.getMinimum(Calendar.YEAR);
        int minMonth = calendar.getMinimum(Calendar.MONTH); 
        int minWeekOfYear = calendar.getMinimum(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR); // Note: Week of year is rarely used for "minimum"
        int minDayOfMonth = calendar.getMinimum(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);
        int minDayOfWeek = calendar.getMinimum(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK); // Day of week (Sunday=1)


        System.out.println("Minimum Year: " + minYear);
        System.out.println("Minimum Month: " + minMonth);  // Month is 0-indexed (0=January)
        System.out.println("Minimum Week of Year: " + minWeekOfYear); // Often 1, but check documentation
        System.out.println("Minimum Day of Month: " + minDayOfMonth); // Always 1
        System.out.println("Minimum Day of Week: " + minDayOfWeek); // Usually Sunday=1 (depending on locale)

    }
}
```


Key Improvements:

* **Clarity:**  Uses `GregorianCalendar` explicitly for better understanding.
* **Accuracy:**  Corrected the explanation of `Calendar.MONTH` (it's 0-indexed).
* **Completeness:** Added `minDayOfWeek` to cover all requested units (year, month, week, date, and implicitly day of week).
* **Explanation:** Included comments explaining the meaning of each minimum value and any potential caveats.
* **Conciseness:** Removed unnecessary intermediate variables.


Explanation of Minimum Values:

* **Minimum Year:**  The smallest year supported by the `Calendar` implementation (usually 1).
* **Minimum Month:** Always 0 (representing January, since months are 0-indexed).
* **Minimum Week of Year:** Usually 1, but could depend on locale and `Calendar` settings.  This is the smallest value for the week-of-year field.
* **Minimum Day of Month:** Always 1 (the first day of the month).
* **Minimum Day of Week:** Usually 1 (representing Sunday), but could be different based on `FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK` settings (locale-dependent).  This is not the minimum date, but the minimum value allowed for day of the week.


Important Note:  The `getMinimum()` method provides the minimum *possible* value for a field, not the minimum value *within the current month or year*. For example, `calendar.getMinimum(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH)` will always return 1, regardless of the month or year set in the calendar.
