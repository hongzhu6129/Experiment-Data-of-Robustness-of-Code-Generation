**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Test Cases:** The code now includes a `testCircle()` method to systematically test different radius values, including:
   - The original example (7.5).
   - Zero radius.
   - Negative radius (a corner case).
   - A large radius.
   - `Double.MAX_VALUE` (to check for potential overflow issues with very large numbers).

2. **Error Handling:** The `calculatePerimeter()` and `calculateArea()` methods now throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the radius is negative. This is good practice to prevent unexpected behavior or calculations with invalid inputs. The `testCircle` method uses a try-catch block to gracefully handle these exceptions.

3. **Clarity and Readability:** The code is organized into methods for better structure. The output is formatted with clear labels for radius, perimeter, and area.  The `--------------------` visually separates test case outputs.
