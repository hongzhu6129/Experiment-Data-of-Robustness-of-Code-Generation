Key improvements and explanations:

* **JUnit Tests:**  The code now includes comprehensive JUnit tests to verify the correctness of the `calculatePerimeter` and `calculateArea` methods. This is crucial for robust code.
* **Corner Cases:** The tests cover important corner cases:
    * Zero radius.
    * Very large radius (checking for potential overflow).
    * Very small radius.
    * Negative radius (expecting `IllegalArgumentException` � you'll need to add the exception handling to your main code if you want to handle it gracefully there).
* **Floating-Point Comparisons:** When comparing floating-point numbers, use a `delta` value (a tolerance) to account for potential inaccuracies in floating-point representation.  `assertEquals(expected, actual, delta)`
* **Clearer Output:** The `main` method output is more informative, labeling the radius, perimeter, and area.
* **Exception Handling (in tests):**  `assertThrows()` in JUnit 5 is used to test that the expected exceptions are thrown in the appropriate cases (negative radius).  You can add exception handling to your `main` method as well if needed.


How to run the tests (assuming you have JUnit 5 set up):

1.  Save the code as `CircleCalculations.java` and `CircleCalculationsTest.java` in the appropriate directory in your project.
2.  Compile: `javac CircleCalculations.java CircleCalculationsTest.java`
3.  Run tests (using a test runner):  For example, with IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can right-click and choose "Run Tests."  From the command line, you might use a command like `java -cp <junit-jar-path> org.junit.runner.JUnitCore CircleCalculationsTest` (adjust the classpath as needed).


This revised version is much more robust and demonstrates good testing practices.  It's essential to get in the habit of writing tests, especially when dealing with calculations or complex logic.
