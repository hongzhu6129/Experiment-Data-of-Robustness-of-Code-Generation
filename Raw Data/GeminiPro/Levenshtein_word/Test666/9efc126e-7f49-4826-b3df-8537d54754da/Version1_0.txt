        subMap.put(5, "Five"); // This will be reflected in the original map because subMap is a view.

Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Explanation:**  Added comments to explain each step and the behavior of `headMap`.
* **Illustrative Examples:** Included multiple examples with different `givenKey` values to showcase how `headMap` works, including cases where the key doesn't exist in the map and when it's the smallest key.
* **Important Note on `headMap`:** Explicitly stated that `headMap` is *exclusive* of the `toKey`. This is crucial for understanding its behavior.
* **View vs. Copy Clarification:** Added a final example to demonstrate that the submap returned by `headMap` is a *view* of the original map, not a copy. Modifications made to the submap affect the original map. This is a critical point to understand to avoid unexpected side effects.
