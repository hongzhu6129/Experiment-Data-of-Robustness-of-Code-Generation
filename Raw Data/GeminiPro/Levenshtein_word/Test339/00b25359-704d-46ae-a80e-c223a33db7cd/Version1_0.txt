```java
public class StringLength {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "example string"; // The input string
        int length = str.length(); // Get the length of the string
        System.out.println("The length of the string is: " + length);


        // Demonstrating with command-line arguments (if provided)
        if (args.length > 0) { 
            String argString = args[0];
            int argLength = argString.length();
            System.out.println("The length of the string passed as an argument is: " + argLength);
        }
    }
}
```


This code demonstrates two ways to get the length of a string:

1. **Using a hardcoded string:** The variable `str` is initialized with "example string", and its length is obtained using `str.length()`.

2. **Using command-line arguments:**  The `args` array in `main` holds any command-line arguments passed to the program. If any arguments are provided (checked using `args.length > 0`), the first argument (`args[0]`) is treated as a string, and its length is calculated and printed.  To run with command-line arguments, you would compile the code and then execute it from the command line like this: `java StringLength "my string"` (replace `"my string"` with the string you want to test).


This revised answer adheres to the prompt's requirement of using only the `public static void main(String[] args)` method signature.
