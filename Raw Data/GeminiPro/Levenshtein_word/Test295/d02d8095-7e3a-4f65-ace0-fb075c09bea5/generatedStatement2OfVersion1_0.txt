Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`prime_cell(int, int)` Method:**  This method now correctly takes two integer arguments (i and j) and returns 0 (representing false) if both i and j are prime, and 1 (representing true) otherwise.
2. **`isPrime(int)` Helper Method:** This separate helper function efficiently checks if a given number is prime. This makes the `prime_cell` method cleaner and easier to understand.
3. **Clearer True/False Representation:** Instead of using booleans directly, I use 0 for false and 1 for true within the 2D array. This is just for clarity when printing the array; you could use booleans if preferred.
4. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to create the 2D array and populate it using the `prime_cell` method.  It includes an example `m` value (size of the array), but you can modify this.
5. **Printing the Array:** The `main` method now includes code to print the generated 2D array to the console so you can see the results.  You can remove this if you don't need the printing functionality.
6. **Efficiency in `isPrime`:**  The `isPrime` function uses `i * i <= n` in the loop condition, which is a more efficient way to check for primality than going all the way up to `n`.


This improved version adheres to the provided method signature requirements and creates the 2D array according to the problem description.
