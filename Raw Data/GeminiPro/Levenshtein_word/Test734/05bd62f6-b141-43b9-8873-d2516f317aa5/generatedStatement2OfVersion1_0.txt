Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `m` and `n` for dimensions improves readability.

2. **Returns an Array:** The `Saddleback` method now returns an `int[]` to store both the row and column index. This is much cleaner than using `System.out.println` inside the search function.  If the element isn't found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.

3. **Error Handling in `main`:**  The `main` method now checks the returned array from `Saddleback` to print an appropriate message if the element is not found.

4. **Example Usage and Testing:** The `main` method now demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function and includes a test case with a target value that's *not* in the array to show the "not found" handling.


This revised version is more robust, easier to understand, and follows best practices for function design and error handling.
