With JUnit, you can easily run all your test cases at once and quickly identify any issues. This is essential for ensuring the correctness of your code, especially as it becomes more complex.  You would typically put the `calculateProduct` helper function as a method *inside* the `ProductOfTwoNumbers` class itself�it's outside just to separate the example cleanly.  You also wouldn't need the `Scanner` in your production code as input would come through the `calculateProduct` method's parameters.
