**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Milliseconds vs. Seconds:** Unix timestamps are typically in seconds, but the `Date` constructor in Java expects milliseconds.  The code now correctly multiplies by 1000 to convert.

2. **Command-line Argument Handling:**  The code now optionally accepts a Unix timestamp as a command-line argument. This makes it more flexible.  It also includes error handling in case the argument isn't a valid number.

3. **Clearer Output:**  The output now labels the dates to make it easier to understand (especially when using command-line arguments).

**How to Run (with command-line argument):**

1. **Compile:** `javac UnixTimestampToDate.java`
2. **Run:** `java UnixTimestampToDate 1678886400`  (Replace `1678886400` with your desired timestamp)


**Key improvements over previous versions:**

* **Correctness:** Handles the seconds-to-milliseconds conversion accurately.
* **Flexibility:**  Allows you to provide a timestamp as a command-line argument.
* **Robustness:** Includes error handling for invalid input.
* **Clarity:** Improved output labeling.
