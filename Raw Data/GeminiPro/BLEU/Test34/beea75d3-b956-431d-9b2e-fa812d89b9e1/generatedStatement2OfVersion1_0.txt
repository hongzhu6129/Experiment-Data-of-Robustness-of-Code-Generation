Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Output:** The output now includes the display name of each charset along with its canonical name, making it easier to understand.
2. **Optional Alias Printing:** I've added a commented-out line that shows how to print the aliases for each charset if needed.  Uncomment this line if alias information is important for your use case.
3. **Test Cases:**  I've outlined essential test cases, including positive tests (verifying common charsets), a test for potential case insensitivity issues (which might affect portability), and, crucially, a corner case test for handling an empty set of available charsets.
4. **Mock Example for Corner Case:**  I've included a separate example demonstrating how to simulate the "empty available charsets" corner case using a mock `SortedMap`. This example shows a robust way to test that your code handles this unlikely but possible scenario gracefully, preventing potential `NullPointerExceptions`.  This demonstrates good defensive programming practice.


This revised answer provides a more complete solution, including clearer output, better documentation, and thorough testing considerations.
