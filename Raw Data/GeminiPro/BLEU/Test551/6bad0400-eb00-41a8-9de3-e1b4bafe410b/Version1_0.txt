**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **`try-with-resources`:** The code uses the `try-with-resources` statement. This ensures that the `BufferedWriter` is automatically closed, even if an exception occurs. This prevents resource leaks.

2. **Append Mode:** The `FileWriter` is initialized with `new FileWriter(filePath, true)`. The `true` argument is crucial; it opens the file in append mode. Without it, the file would be overwritten.

3. **Error Handling:** The code includes a `catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions`. It prints an error message to the console and provides more detailed information using `e.printStackTrace()`.  In a real application, more sophisticated error handling might be required (e.g., logging the error, displaying a user-friendly message, or retrying the operation).

4. **Clear Comments:** The code has been thoroughly commented to explain the purpose of each part.

5. **Newline Character:** The `textToAppend` string includes `\n`, which adds a newline character. This ensures that appended text starts on a new line.

6. **Example File Path:**  The code includes an example file path (`"my_file.txt"`). Remember to replace this with the actual path to your file.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `AppendToFile.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:
   ```bash
   javac AppendToFile.java 
   ```
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program:
   ```bash
   java AppendToFile
   ```

This will append the specified text to `my_file.txt` (or the file path you provided).  If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.  If it exists, the new text will be added at the end.
