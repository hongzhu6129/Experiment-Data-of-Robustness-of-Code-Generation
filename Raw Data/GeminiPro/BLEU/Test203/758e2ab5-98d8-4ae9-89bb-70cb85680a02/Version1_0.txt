**Test cases:**

* **Corner cases:**
    * Minor is less than the first character in the applicable characters sequence.
    * Minor is greater than the last character in the applicable characters sequence.
* **Normal cases:**
    * Minor is equal to one of the characters in the applicable characters sequence.
    * Minor is not equal to any of the characters in the applicable characters sequence.
