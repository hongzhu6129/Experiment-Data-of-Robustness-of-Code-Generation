**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input | Expected Output | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Positive Even | 10 | 10 is even. | Basic even number check. |
| Positive Odd | 7 | 7 is not even (odd). | Basic odd number check. |
| Zero | 0 | 0 is even. | Zero is considered even. |
| Negative Even | -8 | -8 is even. | Even property holds for negative numbers. |
| Negative Odd | -15 | -15 is not even (odd). | Odd property holds for negative numbers. |
| Large Positive Even | 2147483646 (Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1) | 2147483646 is even. |  Testing with a large positive even number close to the maximum integer value. |
| Large Positive Odd | 2147483647 (Integer.MAX_VALUE) | 2147483647 is not even (odd). |  Testing with the maximum integer value, which is odd. |
| Large Negative Even | -2147483648 (Integer.MIN_VALUE) | -2147483648 is even. | Testing with the minimum integer value, which is even. |
| Large Negative Odd | -2147483647 (Integer.MIN_VALUE + 1) | -2147483647 is not even (odd). | Testing with a large negative odd number close to the minimum integer value. |



**How to run the tests (Manually):**

1.  **Compile:** Save the code as `EvenNumberChecker.java` and compile it using a Java compiler: `javac EvenNumberChecker.java`
2.  **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java EvenNumberChecker`
3.  **Input:** Enter each test case input when prompted.
4.  **Verify:** Check if the output matches the expected output.



**How to Automate Testing (using JUnit - Optional):**

JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java.  Here's how you could use it to automate the tests:
