```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadPlainTextApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Replace "path/to/your/text/file.txt" with the actual path to your text file.
        String filePath = "path/to/your/text/file.txt"; 

        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line); // Print each line of the file
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("An error occurred while reading the file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that can occur during file reading. This is crucial for robust code.  It prints an informative error message to the console if something goes wrong.

2. **Resource Management (try-with-resources):** The `BufferedReader` is created within a `try-with-resources` block. This ensures that the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed even if an exception occurs, preventing resource leaks.

3. **Clearer File Path:** The file path is now stored in a variable `filePath`, making it easier to modify.  **Remember to replace `"path/to/your/text/file.txt"` with the actual path of the text file you want to read.**

4. **Line-by-Line Reading:** The code uses `reader.readLine()` inside a `while` loop to read the file line by line. This is more efficient than reading the entire file into memory at once, especially for large files.

**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ReadPlainTextApplication.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:  `javac ReadPlainTextApplication.java`
3. **Run:**  `java ReadPlainTextApplication`


**Example `textfile.txt` content:**

```
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
And this is the third.
```

**Output after running the Java program (if `textfile.txt` is in the same directory):**

```
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
And this is the third.
```
