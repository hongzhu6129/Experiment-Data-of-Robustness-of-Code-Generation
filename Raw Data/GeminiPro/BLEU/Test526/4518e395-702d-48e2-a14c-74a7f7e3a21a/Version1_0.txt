```java
public class DiophantineNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Diophantine numbers are numbers that can be expressed as the difference of two positive integer squares.
        //  x = a^2 - b^2

        // We'll generate and display the first 10 such numbers efficiently:

        int count = 0;
        int n = 1;

        while (count < 10) {
            for (int a = n + 1; ; a++) { // Start 'a' from n+1 to ensure a positive difference
                int diff = a * a - n * n;

                //Check if the difference is a Diophantine number
                if (diff > 0) {
                    System.out.println(diff);
                    count++;
                    if (count >= 10) {
                        break;
                    }
                 }
            }

**Explanation and Improvement over simpler approaches:**

1. **Diophantine Number Definition:**  A Diophantine number is a number that can be expressed as the difference of two positive integer squares (x = a� - b�).

2. **Efficient Generation:** The code uses a nested loop structure to efficiently generate Diophantine numbers. The outer loop iterates through possible values of 'n' (essentially the smaller square, b�). The inner loop iterates through 'a' values (the larger square, a�).  We start `a` from `n+1` to ensure the difference is always positive.

3. **Avoiding Redundancy and Duplicates:**  This approach avoids generating duplicate Diophantine numbers and is more efficient than checking all possible pairs of squares.  It systematically generates the numbers in an increasing order.

4. **Stopping Condition:**  The `count` variable keeps track of how many Diophantine numbers have been found and displayed. The loops stop when `count` reaches 10.
