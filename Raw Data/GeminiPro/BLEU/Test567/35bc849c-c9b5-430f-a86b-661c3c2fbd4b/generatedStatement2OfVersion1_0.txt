Key improvements and explanations in this version:

* **Clearer Explanations and Comments:**  More comments explain each step, making the educational aspect stronger.
* **Two Swap Methods:** Shows both `Collections.swap()` (the easier and preferred way) and manual swapping using `get()` and `set()` to illustrate how swapping works under the hood.
* **Error Handling (IndexOutOfBoundsException):** The code now includes `try-catch` blocks to handle `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. This is crucial for robustness and demonstrates good programming practices.  It also gives specific error messages about the valid index range.
* **Demonstrates Error Handling:** The code now *intentionally* introduces invalid indices to show how the `try-catch` blocks prevent the program from crashing and provide informative error messages.
* **Resets ArrayList:** After each swap demonstration, the `ArrayList` is reset to its original state to ensure that each example is independent.  This makes the output easier to follow.
* **Clearer Output:** The `println` statements are more descriptive, making it easier to understand what's happening at each stage.


This improved version provides a more comprehensive and robust educational example of swapping elements in an `ArrayList` in Java.
