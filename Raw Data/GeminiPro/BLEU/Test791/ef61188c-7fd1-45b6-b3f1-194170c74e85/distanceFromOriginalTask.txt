nullInput Sentence 1:  \n3.1 (Algebra: solve quadratic equations) The two roots of a quadratic equation can be obtained. If it is positive, the\nequation has two real roots. If it is zero, the equation has one root. If it is negative,\nthe equation has no real roots.\nWrite a program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displays\nthe result based on the discriminant. If the discriminant is positive, display two\nroots. If the discriminant is 0, display one root. Otherwise, display The equation\nhas no real roots.\n\n Input Sentence 2: 24. 3. 1 (algebra: solve quadratic equations) the two roots of a quadratic equation can be obtained. if it is positive, theequation has two real roots. would it is zero, the equation has one root. if it is negative, the equation has no real roots. write a program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displaysthe result based on the discriminant. if the discriminant is positive, display tworoots. if the discriminant is 0, display one root. otherwise, display the equationhas no real roots.Cosine Similarity: 0.9978Euclidean Distance: 0.3961
