```java
public class FacePrinter {

    public static void printFace() {
        System.out.println("  +\"\"\"\"+");
        System.out.println(" [| o o |]");
        System.out.println("  |  ^  |");
        System.out.println("  | '-' |");
        System.out.println("  +-----+");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printFace();
    }
}
```

**Test Cases (While these aren't automated unit tests, they represent different scenarios to consider):**

1. **Basic Functionality:**  Simply run the program as is.  Visually inspect the output to verify it matches the expected face.

2. **Output Redirection:** Redirect the output to a file and then compare the file contents to the expected output.  This helps test in environments without a direct console.
   ```bash
   java FacePrinter > output.txt
   ```
   Then compare `output.txt` with the expected face representation.

3. **Character Encoding:**  Ensure the program works correctly with different character encodings (e.g., UTF-8, ASCII).  While less of a concern with basic ASCII characters like those used in this face, it's good practice to consider when dealing with more complex output.  Set your console or output file encoding appropriately.

4. **System.out Failure (Simulated):**  While challenging to genuinely test `System.out` failure directly (it's a core system stream), you can simulate its behavior in more sophisticated testing frameworks (like JUnit or Mockito) by mocking `System.out` and throwing exceptions to see how your code handles potential errors. This is more advanced testing.  For a simple program like this, observing that it runs without errors under normal conditions is often sufficient.



**Explanation of the code:**

The `printFace()` method uses `System.out.println()` to print each line of the face to the console.  The face is constructed using a combination of characters like `+`, `-`, `|`, `o`, `^`, and spaces.  The `main()` method simply calls `printFace()` to execute the printing logic.



**Why there aren't many "corner cases" here:**

This program is very simple. There's no user input, no complex logic, no file I/O, or network operations.  Therefore, there are fewer traditional "corner cases" to consider. The most significant aspect to verify is that the output is visually correct and that the program doesn't crash due to syntax errors or incorrect use of the `System.out.println()` method.  The provided tests address these core considerations.


If the face printing program were more complex (e.g., allowed the user to specify the size or features of the face), then more extensive testing would be needed to handle different input values and potential errors related to user input.
