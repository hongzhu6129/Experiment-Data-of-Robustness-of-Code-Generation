Test Cases and Corner Cases:


1. **Invalid Dimensions (Too Small):** `createFace(2, 2)`, `createFace(1, 5)`, `createFace(0,0)`  - Should return `null`.

2. **Minimum Valid Size:** `createFace(3, 3)` - Should create a very small but valid face.

3. **Small Face (Odd Dimensions):** `createFace(5, 5)` -  Tests basic face drawing.

4. **Larger Face (Even Dimensions):** `createFace(10, 6)` - Checks scaling and positioning of features.

5. **Larger Face (Odd Dimensions):** `createFace(15, 9)` - Further scaling test with odd dimensions.

6. **Very Wide Face:**  `createFace(20, 5)` - Tests handling of elongated faces.


7. **Very Tall Face:** `createFace(5, 15)`  - Tests handling of tall faces.


These test cases cover various scenarios to ensure the `createFace` method correctly handles different input dimensions and generates the expected output.  Remember to visually inspect the output to verify proper placement of the eyes and mouth relative to the face outline.
