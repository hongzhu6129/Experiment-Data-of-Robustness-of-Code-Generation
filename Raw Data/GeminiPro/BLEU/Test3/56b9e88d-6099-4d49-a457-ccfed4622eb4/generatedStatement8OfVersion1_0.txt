4. **Large Positive Number:**
   - Input: `10000` (or any other large positive number)
   - Expected Output:  Multiplication table should be correctly calculated and printed. This tests for potential overflow issues (though Java's `int` type can handle this range).

5. **Large Negative Number:**
   - Input: `-10000`  (or any other large negative number)
   - Expected Output: Similar to the large positive number case, this tests for correct handling of large negative values.

6. **Input Validation (Non-Integer):**
   - Input: `2.5` (or any non-integer value)
   - Expected Behavior: The program should handle this gracefully. The `Scanner.nextInt()` method will throw an `InputMismatchException` if the input is not an integer.  A robust program would catch this exception and prompt the user for valid input.  The provided code does not include this exception handling, so it will terminate with an error.  Adding a `try-catch` block would improve robustness:
