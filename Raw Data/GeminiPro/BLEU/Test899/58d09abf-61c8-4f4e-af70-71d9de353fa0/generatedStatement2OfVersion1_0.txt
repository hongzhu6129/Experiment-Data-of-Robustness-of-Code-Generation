Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles the case where there's no unique character:**  It now correctly returns -1 if no unique character exists in the string, as specified by the prompt.
* **Clearer variable names:** Using `charCount` instead of `map` makes the code easier to understand.
* **`getOrDefault()` for efficiency:** Using `charCount.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1` is a slightly more efficient way to handle incrementing character counts.
* **Added more test cases in `main`:** Demonstrates the function's behavior with different input strings, including cases with unique characters at different positions and with no unique characters at all.



This improved version addresses all the prompt's requirements and provides a more robust and understandable solution.
