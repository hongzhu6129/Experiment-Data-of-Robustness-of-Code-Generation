**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The `polyEval` method implements Horner's method, which is an efficient way to evaluate polynomials.  It reduces the number of multiplications required.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using more descriptive variable names (like `coefficients` instead of a generic list name) makes the code easier to understand.

3. **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method now demonstrates how to use the `polyEval` function with a clear example, including creating the list of coefficients and setting the value of `x`. The example calculates -19 + 7x - 4x^2 + 6x^3 at x = 3 and 2 + 3x + x^2 at x = 2.

4. **Flexibility:** The code can handle polynomials of any degree by simply changing the list of coefficients.

5. **Double Precision:**  Using `Double` for the coefficients and `double` for the result and `x` ensures better precision for floating-point calculations.

6. **Reverse Iteration:** The code iterates through the `coefficients` list in reverse order to correctly apply Horner's method, starting from the highest power of x.


This improved version is more efficient, readable, and adaptable to different polynomial evaluations.
