```java
public class PrintBooleanArray {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean[][] boolArray = {
                {true, false, true},
                {false, true, false},
                {true, true, false}
        };

        printBooleanArray(boolArray);
    }

    private static void printBooleanArray(boolean[][] arr) {
        for (boolean[] row : arr) {
            for (boolean value : row) {
                System.out.print(value ? "t " : "f "); // Print "t" for true, "f" for false
            }
            System.out.println(); // New line after each row
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`main` Method:** The `main` method now calls a separate `printBooleanArray` method to handle the printing logic. This keeps the `main` method concise and focused on its primary role of program entry.

2. **`printBooleanArray` Method:** This new method takes the 2D boolean array as input. It uses nested enhanced `for` loops (also known as "for-each" loops) to iterate through the rows and columns of the array.  

3. **Conditional Printing:** Inside the inner loop, a ternary operator (`value ? "t " : "f "`) is used for efficient and readable conditional printing.  It prints "t " if `value` is true, and "f " if `value` is false.  The space after "t" and "f" is added for better formatting.

4. **Newline:** `System.out.println()` is added after the inner loop to print a newline character, ensuring that each row of the array is printed on a separate line.



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a file named `PrintBooleanArray.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler:
   ```bash
   javac PrintBooleanArray.java
   ```
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program:
   ```bash
   java PrintBooleanArray 
   ```

This will print the boolean array to the console with "t" and "f" representing true and false, respectively.


**Example Output:**

```
t f t 
f t f 
t t f 
```
