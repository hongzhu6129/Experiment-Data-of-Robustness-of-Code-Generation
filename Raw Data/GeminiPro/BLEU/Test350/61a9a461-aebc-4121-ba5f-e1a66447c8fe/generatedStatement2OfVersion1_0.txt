Key improvements in this version:

* **Uses a `Set`:**  The `interleavings` is now a `HashSet`. This automatically handles duplicate interleavings, which is crucial for correctness.  The previous versions would print duplicate interleavings if the input strings had repeated characters.
* **Clearer Recursion:** The base case and recursive calls are more concise and readable.
* **Correct Output:** This version produces the correct set of interleavings without duplicates.
* **Example Usage:** The `main` method provides a clear example of how to use the `allInterleavings` method.


Example Output (for "AB" and "CD"):
