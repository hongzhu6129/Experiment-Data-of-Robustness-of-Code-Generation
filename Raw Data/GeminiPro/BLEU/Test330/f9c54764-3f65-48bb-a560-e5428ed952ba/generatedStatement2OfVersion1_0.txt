Key takeaways:

1. **`equals()` method:** This is the preferred way to check if two strings have the same content.  It compares the actual characters within the strings.

2. **`==` operator:**  This checks if two string *references* point to the same memory location.  While it might sometimes appear to work for content comparison (due to string interning/pooling), it's not reliable for general string comparisons.

3. **`compareTo()` method:** This compares strings lexicographically (alphabetical order). It's useful for sorting, but not for simple equality checks.

4. **`equalsIgnoreCase()` method:**  Compares strings while ignoring case differences.


The code examples demonstrate how these methods behave in various scenarios, including the case where strings are created using string literals (which are pooled) and the case where strings are explicitly created using the `new` keyword (which creates separate objects in memory).  Understanding the distinction between `==` and `.equals()` is crucial for avoiding bugs related to string comparison in Java.
