Key improvements:

* **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueCount` is more descriptive than `j`.
* **Comprehensive comments:**  Explaining the logic step by step.
* **Handles edge cases:** Empty and null input arrays are handled correctly.
* **Illustrative `main` method:**  Demonstrates usage with multiple example inputs, including edge cases and printing the modified array up to the new length using `Arrays.copyOfRange`.
* **In-place modification:**  Modifies the original array as required, avoiding extra space allocation.



This improved version is more readable, robust, and effectively addresses the problem's requirements.
