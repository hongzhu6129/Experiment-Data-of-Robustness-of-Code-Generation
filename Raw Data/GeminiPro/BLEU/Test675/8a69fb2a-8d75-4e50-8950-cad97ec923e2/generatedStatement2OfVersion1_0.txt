Key improvements and explanations in this version:

* **Clearer Comments:**  Explains the code's purpose and logic in detail.
* **Illustrative Examples:** Shows how to create and populate the map, get the submap, and handle edge cases.
* **Inclusivity/Exclusivity Control:** Demonstrates how to use the boolean parameters in `subMap()` to control whether the boundaries are included or excluded.
* **Handling Missing Keys:** Explains how `subMap()` deals with keys that might not exist in the original map.
* **Invalid Range Handling:** Addresses the scenario where `fromKey` is greater than `toKey`, advising explicit checks and showing the potential behavior of `subMap()` in such cases.
* **`NavigableMap` Emphasis:** Uses `NavigableMap` which is the correct interface for the `subMap` operation and its variants.  TreeMap is used as a concrete implementation.
