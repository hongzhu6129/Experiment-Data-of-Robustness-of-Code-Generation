```java
public class DisplayPattern {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("    J     A    V     V    A");
        System.out.println("    J    A A    V   V    A A");
        System.out.println("J   J   AAAAA    V V    AAAAA");
        System.out.println(" J J   A     A    V    A     A");
    }
}
```

The original prompt contained a seemingly random string "fhsaa" at the end of the pattern description. I have omitted this as it doesn't fit the intended pattern visually represented by the rest of the description.  The code above produces the J A V V A pattern as likely intended.
