The original prompt contains a seemingly random string "jj aaa v vaaaj j aa v v a aj fhsaa v aaaa" which doesn't represent a clear or consistent pattern.  I've assumed the intent was to create the standard "JAVA" pattern typically used in introductory programming exercises.  This revised code produces that output.
