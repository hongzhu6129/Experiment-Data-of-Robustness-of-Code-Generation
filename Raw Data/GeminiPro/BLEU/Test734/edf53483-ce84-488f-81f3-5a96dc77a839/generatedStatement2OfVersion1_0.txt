Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `m` and `n` for dimensions is standard and makes the code easier to read.

2. **Returns an Array:** The `Saddleback` method now returns an `int[]`  to hold both the row and column index of the target.  This is a much better practice than using a `String` to represent coordinates.  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.

3. **Concise Conditionals:**  The `if/else if/else` structure is more compact and efficient.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method now demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function and interpret its results. It also includes a test case where the target is not present in the matrix.

5. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic within the `Saddleback` method.


How the Saddleback Search Works:

The Saddleback search starts at the top-right corner of the matrix.  It then compares the target value with the current element:

- If the target is equal to the current element, we've found it.
- If the target is greater than the current element, we move down to the next row because all elements in the current row and above are smaller than the target.
- If the target is less than the current element, we move left to the previous column because all elements in the current column and to the right are larger than the target.

This process continues until the target is found or we've exhausted the search space (gone out of bounds of the matrix).  This method is efficient because it eliminates a row or a column in each comparison.
