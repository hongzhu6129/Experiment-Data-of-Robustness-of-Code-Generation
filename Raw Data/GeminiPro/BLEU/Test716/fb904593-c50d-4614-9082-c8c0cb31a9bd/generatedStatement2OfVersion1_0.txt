Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Invalid Input:** The `beadSort` method now handles `null` or empty input arrays gracefully by returning an empty array. This prevents potential `NullPointerExceptions`.

2. **Clearer Initialization:** The `grid` is initialized with `'-'` characters to visually represent empty spaces, making the algorithm's logic clearer.

3. **Simplified Bead Dropping:** The bead "dropping" logic is simplified by directly counting the beads in each column to determine the sorted values.

4. **Streamlined Max Value:**  The maximum value is efficiently calculated using `Arrays.stream().max()`.

5. **Included Required Display Methods:**  `display1D(char[])` and `display2D(char[][])` are implemented, as specified in the prompt, even though they aren't strictly necessary for the core bead sort algorithm.


This revised code addresses potential issues, enhances readability, and provides a more robust implementation of the bead sort algorithm while adhering to the specified method signatures.  It also directly addresses the "invalid literal for int()" error you were encountering, which likely stemmed from trying to parse non-numeric input.  This version only deals with integers for the sorting itself.
