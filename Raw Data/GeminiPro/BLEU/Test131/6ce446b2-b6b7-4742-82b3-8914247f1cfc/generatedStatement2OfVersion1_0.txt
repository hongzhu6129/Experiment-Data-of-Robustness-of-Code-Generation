**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **HashMap Approach:** The `getSingleNumber` function uses a `HashMap` to store the frequency of each number.  We iterate through the array, incrementing the count for each number. Then, we iterate again and return the number with a count of 1.


2. **Error Handling (Optional):**  Although the problem states that there will always be one unique number,  I've added a `return -1` at the end as a safety net. In a real-world scenario, you might want to throw an exception or handle the case where the input doesn't meet the expected criteria.


3. **Alternative (Bit Manipulation - XOR):**  A more efficient solution (though perhaps less immediately obvious) utilizes the XOR bitwise operator.  XOR has the property that `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`. If you XOR all the numbers in the array, the numbers that appear twice will cancel each other out, leaving you with the single number.
