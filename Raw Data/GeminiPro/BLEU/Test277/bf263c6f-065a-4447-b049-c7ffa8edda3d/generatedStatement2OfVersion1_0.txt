Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Comments:**  Explanatory comments guide the reader through the code's logic.
* **Robustness:** Handles edge cases (null or empty input list).
* **Object-Oriented:**  Uses `Interval` objects, promoting better organization and data encapsulation.
* **Correct Merging Logic:** Ensures correct merging even with multiple overlapping intervals.
* **Example Usage in `main`:** Demonstrates how to use the `merge` method with sample data.


This revised response addresses the requirements of using only the specified method signatures while creating a more complete and educational example.  It provides a clear and concise solution to the merging intervals problem.
