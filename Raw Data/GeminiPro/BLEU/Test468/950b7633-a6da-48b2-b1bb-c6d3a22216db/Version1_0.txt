public class DateDifference {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example dates (replace with your desired dates)
        LocalDateTime date1 = LocalDateTime.of(2024, 1, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0);
        LocalDateTime date2 = LocalDateTime.of(2024, 1, 15, 12, 30, 15, 500000000);

        // Calculate the duration between the two dates
        Duration duration = Duration.between(date1, date2);

        // Extract the difference in various units
        long hours = duration.toHours();
        long minutes = duration.toMinutesPart();  // Minutes within the hour
        long millis = duration.toMillisPart();   // Milliseconds within the second
        long nanos = duration.toNanosPart();    // Nanoseconds within the second

		// Total Minutes and Milliseconds (if needed)
        long totalMinutes = duration.toMinutes();
        long totalMillis = duration.toMillis();


        // Output the results
        System.out.println("Difference between dates:");
        System.out.println("Hours: " + hours);
        System.out.println("Minutes (within the hour): " + minutes);  // Clarified output
        System.out.println("Total Minutes: " + totalMinutes);
        System.out.println("Milliseconds (within the second): " + millis); // Clarified output
        System.out.println("Total Milliseconds: " + totalMillis);
        System.out.println("Nanoseconds (within the second): " + nanos);  // Clarified output

        // For total difference in nanoseconds, use duration.toNanos() (but might be very large)
        // System.out.println("Nanoseconds: " + duration.toNanos()); 
    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity in Output:** The output now clearly distinguishes between:
   - Hours: Total difference in hours.
   - Minutes (within the hour): The remaining minutes after calculating the hours.
   - Total Minutes: The complete difference expressed in minutes.
   - Milliseconds (within the second):  The remaining milliseconds after calculating seconds.
   - Total Milliseconds: The complete difference expressed in milliseconds.
   - Nanoseconds (within the second): The remaining nanoseconds after calculating seconds.


2. **Modern Date/Time API:** Uses `java.time` (introduced in Java 8) for cleaner and more reliable date/time handling.  Avoid the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes as they have known design flaws.

3. **`Duration` for Time Differences:** `Duration` is specifically designed for representing differences between time points. It handles the complexities of time units correctly.

4. **`toMinutesPart()`, `toMillisPart()`, `toNanosPart()`:** These methods directly give you the minute, millisecond, and nanosecond parts within the corresponding larger units (hour and second). This prevents incorrect calculations and makes the code simpler to read and understand.


5. **Example Usage:**  Provides example dates so you can see how to use the code.  Replace these with your own date values.

6. **Total Minutes/Milliseconds:** The code now also shows how to get the _total_ difference expressed in minutes or milliseconds, if that's what you need.

7. **Nanoseconds:** The large `toNanos()` value might not always be practically useful, so the output focuses on nanoseconds within the second. It also explains how to get the total nanoseconds if necessary.
