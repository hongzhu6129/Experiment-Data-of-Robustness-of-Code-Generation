Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:** Includes handling for empty and null input arrays.
- **Clearer output:** Prints the new length and the updated portion of the array (using `Arrays.copyOfRange` which is crucial as the original array is modified in place)  for better understanding.
- **More test cases:**  Demonstrates handling different scenarios.
- **Efficiency:**  The `removeDuplicates` function itself remains efficient by modifying the array in place in O(n) time.
