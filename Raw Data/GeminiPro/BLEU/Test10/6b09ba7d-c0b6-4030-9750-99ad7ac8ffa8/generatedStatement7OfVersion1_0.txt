**Corner Cases (Not Applicable in this Specific Example):**

For this particular program, there are no real "corner cases" in the traditional input-based sense.  The output is fixed and doesn't depend on any external factors. However, if the program were modified to take input (e.g., to change the facial expression), then we would need to consider corner cases such as:

* **Invalid input:**  What if the user enters non-expected characters or values?
* **Empty input:** What if the user provides no input?
* **Boundary conditions:** What if the input is at the limits of acceptable values (e.g., maximum length of a string)?



This enhanced explanation provides a much more comprehensive understanding of how to test even simple programs like this and sets the stage for more complex testing scenarios.
