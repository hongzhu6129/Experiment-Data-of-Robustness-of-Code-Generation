**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **`main` Method:**
   - The `main` method is the entry point of the program.
   - It uses a `Scanner` to get integer input from the user.
   - Input validation ensures that the number entered is positive.
   - It calls the `add_digits_until_one` method to perform the digit summing.
   - Finally, it prints the result.  It's good practice to close the `Scanner` when you are finished with it.

2. **`add_digits_until_one` Method:**
   - This method takes a positive integer `num` as input.
   - **Outer `while` loop:** This loop continues as long as `num` has more than one digit (i.e., greater than or equal to 10).
   - **Inner `while` loop:** This loop iterates through the digits of `num`.
     - `num % 10` extracts the last digit.
     - `num /= 10` removes the last digit (integer division).
     - The `sum` variable accumulates the digits.
   - After the inner loop, `num` is updated with the calculated `sum`.
   - The outer loop repeats this process until `num` becomes a single digit.
   - The final single-digit `num` is returned.


**Example Usage:**

If the user enters 12345:

1. The initial `num` is 12345.
2. First iteration: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. `num` becomes 15.
3. Second iteration: 1 + 5 = 6. `num` becomes 6.
4. The loop terminates because 6 is a single digit.
5. The output is 6.


**Key Concepts:**

* **Loops:** Demonstrates the use of nested `while` loops for iteration and digit extraction.
* **Modulo Operator (%):** Used to extract the last digit of a number.
* **Integer Division (/):** Used to remove the last digit.
* **Method Design:** Shows how to break down a problem into smaller, more manageable methods.
* **Input Validation:**  Highlights the importance of checking user input for correctness.
* **Resource Management:** Shows the good practice of closing the `Scanner`.
