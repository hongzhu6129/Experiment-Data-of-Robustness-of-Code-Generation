**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input (num1, num2, num3) | Expected Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 23, 33, 43 | true |
| 2 | 17, 25, 37 | true |
| 3 | 10, 20, 30 | true | // Corner case: all ending in 0
| 4 | 1, 2, 3 | false |
| 5 | 12, 22, 22 | true | // Corner case: all the same rightmost digit
| 6 | 0, 0, 0 | true |   // Corner case: all zeros
| 7 | 100, 200, 300 | true | // Corner case: larger numbers ending in 0
| 8 | 12345, 67895, 101115| true | // Larger numbers
| 9 | 1, 11, 111 | true |
| 10| 2, 3, 4  | false |



**Explanation of Corner Cases and How the Code Handles Them:**

* **All Zeros (Test cases 6 and 7):** The code correctly handles cases where all numbers end in zero because the modulo operator (%) will return 0 for all of them, leading to the condition `(right1 == right2)` evaluating to `true`.
* **All Same Rightmost Digit (Test case 5):**  The code handles this scenario correctly as well. Any pair of rightmost digits will be equal, satisfying the conditions in the `function`.
* **Numbers ending in zero along with other digits:** The code is designed to handle this correctly as it only considers the last digit which may be 0.



This comprehensive set of test cases helps ensure that the `function` method behaves correctly under various conditions, increasing confidence in the code's reliability.  It's good practice to always test your code with a range of inputs, especially including edge cases and boundary conditions.
