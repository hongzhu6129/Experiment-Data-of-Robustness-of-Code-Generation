        // Specify the path to your file

**Explanation and How to Use:**

1. **Import necessary classes:**
   - `java.io.BufferedReader`:  Used for efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.
   - `java.io.FileReader`: Used to read character files.
   - `java.io.IOException`:  Handles potential input/output errors.

2. **Specify file path:**
   - Replace `"path/to/your/file.txt"` with the actual path to the file you want to read.  For example:  `"C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\myFile.txt"` (Windows) or `"/home/yourname/documents/myFile.txt"` (Linux/macOS).  Make sure the file exists at the specified location.

3. **Try-with-resources:**
   - The `try (BufferedReader reader = ...)` syntax ensures that the `BufferedReader` and `FileReader` are automatically closed, even if an exception occurs.  This is crucial for preventing resource leaks.

4. **Create BufferedReader:**
   - `new FileReader(filePath)` creates a `FileReader` to read characters from the file.
   - `new BufferedReader(fileReader)` wraps the `FileReader` in a `BufferedReader` for more efficient reading, especially when reading line by line.

5. **Read lines in a loop:**
   - `reader.readLine()` reads a single line of text from the file and returns it as a `String`. It returns `null` when the end of the file is reached.
   - The `while` loop continues as long as `readLine()` returns a non-null value (meaning there are more lines to read).

6. **Print each line:**
   - `System.out.println(line);` prints the current line read from the file to the console.

7. **Catch exceptions:**
   - The `catch (IOException e)` block handles any potential `IOException` that might occur during file reading (e.g., if the file doesn't exist or there are permission issues).  It prints an error message to the console.


**To compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ReadFileLineByLine.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run: `javac ReadFileLineByLine.java`
3. **Run:**  `java ReadFileLineByLine`


This will print the contents of your specified file to the console, line by line.  Remember to replace the placeholder file path with the correct path to your file.
