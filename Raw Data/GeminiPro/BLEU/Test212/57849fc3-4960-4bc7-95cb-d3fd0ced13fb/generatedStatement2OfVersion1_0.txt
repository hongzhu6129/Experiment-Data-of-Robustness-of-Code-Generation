Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays without throwing exceptions.
* **Clearer variable names:**  `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than `k`.
* **Improved comments:**  Explains the logic more effectively.
* **Comprehensive `main` method:** Includes multiple test cases to demonstrate how the function behaves with different inputs, including edge cases.
* **Prints the unique part of the array:** Shows the actual modified array after duplicate removal (using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid printing the unchanged latter part). This helps in understanding the function's effect.


This revised code is more robust, easier to understand, and demonstrates the functionality with good test cases.
