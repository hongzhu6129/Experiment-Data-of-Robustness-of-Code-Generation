        System.out.println(num2 + " is a happy number: " + isHappy_number(num2)); // Output: false


        // Test cases from the prompt's examples (though they weren't explicitly requested to be printed).
        System.out.println("7 is a happy number: " + isHappy_number(7));  // true

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **HashSet for Cycle Detection:** The `seen` HashSet is crucial. It stores the numbers encountered during the process. If we encounter a number already in `seen`, it indicates a cycle, and the number is not happy. This prevents infinite loops.

2. **Clearer Loop Condition:** The `while` loop condition `n != 1 && !seen.contains(n)` concisely expresses the two termination conditions: reaching 1 (happy) or entering a cycle (unhappy).

3. **Digit Extraction:** The inner `while` loop efficiently extracts digits using the modulo (%) and division (/) operators.

4. **Concise Return:** The `return n == 1;` directly returns the result after the loop terminates.

5. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to call `isHappy_number` and print the results, making the code easier to understand and test.  I've added a couple more examples based on numbers mentioned in the prompt.


This improved version is more efficient, readable, and robust in handling both happy and unhappy numbers correctly.
