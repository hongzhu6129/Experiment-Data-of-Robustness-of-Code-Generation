Key improvements:

- **Handles edge cases:** Includes checks for `null` or empty input arrays and when `k` is larger than the array's length.
- **Clearer code:**  Uses `Arrays.sort` with `Collections.reverseOrder()` for a straightforward way to sort the final result in descending order. This makes the logic more readable.
- **More efficient conversion to array:**  Uses `minHeap.toArray(new Integer[0])` which is a more efficient way to convert a `PriorityQueue` to an `Integer` array.
- **Comprehensive examples:** Provides several test cases in `main` demonstrating how the function handles different inputs, including edge cases.
- **Conciseness and readability:** The code is now more concise and easier to follow.



This revised code is more robust, handles edge cases correctly, and is generally a better solution for finding the k largest elements.
