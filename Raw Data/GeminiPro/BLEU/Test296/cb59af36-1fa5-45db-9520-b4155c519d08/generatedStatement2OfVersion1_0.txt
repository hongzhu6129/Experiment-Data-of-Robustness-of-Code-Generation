Key improvements and explanations in this code:

* **Handles Edge Cases:**  It now correctly handles cases where the input array is empty, `k` is 0, and `k` is larger than the array size. It provides informative messages in these situations.
* **Min-Heap for Efficiency:** Using a `PriorityQueue` (which is a min-heap implementation in Java) makes the solution more efficient, especially for larger arrays. The time complexity is O(n log k), where n is the array size.
* **Clearer Output:** The output is now more user-friendly, clearly indicating the `k` largest elements.
* **Sorted output** The output `k` largest elements are sorted in ascending order to make it easier to compare with expected results
* **Example Usages**:  The `main` method includes several examples to demonstrate the code's functionality with various inputs. This makes testing and understanding the code easier.
