Key improvements in this version:

- **Clearer Documentation:** The Javadoc now clearly explains the function's purpose, input, output, and provides an example.
- **Handles Edge Cases:** The code explicitly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` input, returning 0 in those cases.  This robust handling is crucial for avoiding `NullPointerExceptions`.
- **Comprehensive Testing in `main`:** The `main` method now includes tests with various inputs, including the original example, a smaller array, an empty array, a `null` array and a single element array, demonstrating the function's behavior in different scenarios.  The output also clearly separates the length and the relevant portion of the array after modification.
- **Efficiency:** The code iterates through the array only once, making it efficient (O(n) time complexity).
- **Conciseness:**  The code is concise and easy to understand.
- **Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`:** In `main`, `Arrays.copyOfRange` is used to display only the relevant portion of the array after duplicates are removed. This avoids showing the "garbage" values that might be left at the end of the original array.
