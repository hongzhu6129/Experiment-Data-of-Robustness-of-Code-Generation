```java
public class Ramanujan {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1729; //  You can change this to search up to a different limit

        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) {  // b starts from a+1 to avoid duplicate pairs
                int sum = a * a * a + b * b * b;
                if (sum > n) break; // Optimization: No need to continue if the sum exceeds n

                int count = 0;
                for (int c = 1; c < b; c++) {   // c < b to ensure different pairs
                    for (int d = c + 1; d <= n; d++) {
                        if (c * c * c + d * d * d == sum) {
                            count++;
                            if (count == 1) { // Found the second way to express the sum
                                System.out.println(sum + " = " + a + "^3 + " + b + "^3 = " + c + "^3 + " + d + "^3");
                                // If you only want to find *one* such number, exit here:
                                // return; 
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Avoids Duplicate Pairs:**  The inner loop for `b` now starts from `a + 1`. This is crucial to avoid counting the same pair of cubes twice (e.g., 1^3 + 12^3 and 12^3 + 1^3).

2. **Optimization with `break`:**  If the sum `a*a*a + b*b*b` exceeds `n`, there's no point in continuing the inner loops. The `break` statement efficiently exits the inner loops in such cases.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly shows both ways the number can be expressed as the sum of two cubes.

4. **Option for Finding Only One Number:** I've added a commented-out `return` statement. If you only want the program to find the *first* such number and then exit, uncomment this line.

5. **Correct Inner Loop Bounds:** The inner loop for `c` goes up to `b-1`, and the loop for `d` can potentially go up to `n` (or you could optimize it further, but for simplicity, I've kept it as `n`).  This ensures we find all distinct pairs.


How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:  `javac Ramanujan.java`
3. **Run:**  `java Ramanujan`


The output for `n = 1729` will be:

```
1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3
```
