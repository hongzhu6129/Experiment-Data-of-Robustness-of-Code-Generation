```java

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int n = 1729; //  Start with Ramanujan's number (or any upper limit)

        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            int a3 = a * a * a;
            if (a3 > n) break; // Optimization: No need to continue if a^3 exceeds n

            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) { // b starts from a+1 to avoid duplicates and ensure distinct pairs
                int b3 = b * b * b;
                if (a3 + b3 > n) break; // Optimization

                for (int c = 1; c <= n; c++) {
                    int c3 = c * c * c;
                    if (c3 > n) break; 

                    for (int d = c + 1; d <= n; d++) {
                        int d3 = d * d * d;
                        if (c3 + d3 > n) break;

                        if (a3 + b3 == c3 + d3 && a3 + b3 <=n) {
                            if(a!=c && a!=d && b!=c && b!=d){ //ensure it is in two different ways. 
                                System.out.println(a3 + b3 + " = " + a + "^3 + " + b + "^3 = " + c + "^3 + " + d + "^3");
                                return; // Exit after finding the first such number
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Efficiency:** Added `break` statements inside the loops to avoid unnecessary calculations when the sums of cubes exceed the target number (`n`). This significantly speeds up the process, especially for larger values of `n`.

2. **Distinct Pairs:** The inner loops now start from `b = a + 1` and `d = c + 1`. This ensures that we only consider distinct pairs of cubes (e.g., (1, 12) and (12, 1) are considered the same and won't be counted twice). It also prevents solutions like a=c and b=d.

3. **Clarity:** Improved variable naming (e.g., `a3`, `b3`, etc.) and comments to explain the logic.

4. **Correctness:** Ensured that the output is indeed the sum of two *different* pairs of cubes by adding the condition `a != c && a!=d && b!=c && b!= d`. This accurately reflects the problem statement's requirement.

5. **Handling no solutions**: Added print statement if the loop does not find any solution. This is to indicate that there is no such number within the limit.


This improved version is more efficient, correct, and easier to understand. It will find Ramanujan's number (1729) or any other number meeting the criteria much faster, especially when exploring a larger range.
