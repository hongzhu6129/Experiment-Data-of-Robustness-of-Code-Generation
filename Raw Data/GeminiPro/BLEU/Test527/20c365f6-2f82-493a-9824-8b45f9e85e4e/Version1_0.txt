Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Efficiency Optimizations:**  Added `break` statements within the loops to avoid unnecessary calculations when `a^3`, `b^3`, or the sum `a^3 + b^3` exceeds `n`. This significantly speeds up the process, especially for larger values of `n`.

2. **Avoiding Duplicates:** The inner loop for `b` now starts from `a + 1`. This prevents checking duplicate pairs like (1, 2) and (2, 1).

3. **Cube Root Calculation:** Using `Math.round(Math.pow(d3, 1.0/3.0))` is a more accurate way to compute the cube root of `d3`.

4. **Clearer Output and Count:**  The code now includes a `count` variable to keep track of the number of other cube pairs. The number itself is only printed when there's at least one other pair (when count becomes 1) which means there are two or more solutions as the problem required.. This makes the output easier to understand and directly addresses the problem's requirement of finding numbers expressible as the sum of two cubes in *two or more* different ways.
5. Correctness : The code is now ordering the c and d so it shows in the right format. Example instead of 1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3, it would return 1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 10^3 + 9^3 which is not necessarily wrong, but this way is more accurate.
