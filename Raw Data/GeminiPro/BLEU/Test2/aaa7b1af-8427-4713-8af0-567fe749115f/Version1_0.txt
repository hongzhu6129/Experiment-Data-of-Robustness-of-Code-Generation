## Test Cases:

Here are some test cases covering normal scenarios and corner cases:

**1. Normal Positive Numbers:**

* Input: num1 = 10, num2 = 5
* Expected Output:
    * Sum: 15.0
    * Difference: 5.0
    * Product: 50.0
    * Quotient: 2.0
    * Remainder: 0.0


**2. Normal Negative Numbers:**

* Input: num1 = -10, num2 = -5
* Expected Output:
    * Sum: -15.0
    * Difference: -5.0
    * Product: 50.0
    * Quotient: 2.0
    * Remainder: 0.0

**3. Mixed Signs:**

* Input: num1 = 10, num2 = -5
* Expected Output:
    * Sum: 5.0
    * Difference: 15.0
    * Product: -50.0
    * Quotient: -2.0
    * Remainder: 0.0


**4. Zero as Second Number (Division by Zero):**

* Input: num1 = 10, num2 = 0
* Expected Output:
    * Sum: 10.0
    * Difference: 10.0
    * Product: 0.0
    * Division by zero is not allowed.  (Handles the exception)


**5. Zero as First Number:**

* Input: num1 = 0, num2 = 5
* Expected Output:
    * Sum: 5.0
    * Difference: -5.0
    * Product: 0.0
    * Quotient: 0.0
    * Remainder: 0.0



**6.  Large Numbers:**

* Input: num1 = 123456789, num2 = 987654321
* Expected Output:  (Check for correct calculations with large values)


**7. Decimal Numbers:**

* Input: num1 = 3.14, num2 = 2.71
* Expected Output: (Check for correct handling of floating-point calculations)


**8.  Integer Overflow/Underflow (Less critical in this case as we use `double`):**  While less of a concern with doubles,  if you were to change the code to use `int`,  you would want to test with very large integers to check for potential overflow/underflow issues.


By running the Java program with these test cases, you can verify its correctness and ensure that it handles various scenarios, including division by zero and large numbers, correctly.  Using JUnit or another testing framework would be a more robust way to automate these tests.
