**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Positive Numbers | 5 | 2 | 7 | 3 | 10 | 2.5 | 1 |
| Negative Numbers | -3 | -4 | -7 | 1 | 12 | 0.75 | -3|
| Zero and Positive | 0 | 6 | 6 | -6 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Positive and Zero | 8 | 0 | 8 | 8 | 0 |  Division by Zero | Division by zero |
| Zero and Zero | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Division by Zero | Division by zero |
| Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000 | 2| 0 |
| Small Numbers | 0.001 | 0.002 | 0.003 | -0.001 | 0.000002 | 0.5 | 0.001 |
| Mixed Signs | -10 | 5 | -5 | -15 | -50 | -2 | 0 |


**How to run the test cases (Manually):**

1.  **Compile the Java code:** `javac ArithmeticOperations.java`
2.  **Run the program:** `java ArithmeticOperations`
3.  The program will prompt you to enter the two numbers. Enter the values from the "num1" and "num2" columns of the test case table.
4.  Compare the output with the expected values in the table.



**Explanation of Corner Cases:**

*   **Division by Zero:**  The code specifically handles the case where the second number (`num2`) is zero to prevent a runtime error.
*   **Zero Values:**  Including tests with zero helps ensure that the basic arithmetic operations work correctly when zero is involved.
*   **Large and Small Numbers:**  Testing with large and small numbers helps to check for potential overflow or underflow issues (although Java's `double` type has a wide range).
*   **Mixed Signs:** Testing with positive and negative numbers covers the full range of possible input combinations.



This comprehensive set of test cases increases confidence that the `ArithmeticOperations` program functions correctly under various conditions.  Ideally, these test cases would be automated using a testing framework (like JUnit) for more efficient and reliable testing.
