**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -5 | -2 | -7 | -3 | 10 | 2.5 | -0.0 |  //remainder with negatives can be tricky. Java's % gives the remainder such that (a/b)*b + a%b = a
| 3. Zero as num1 | 0 | 7 | 7 | -7 | 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 4. Zero as num2 | 5 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 0 | Division by zero | Remainder by zero |  // Corner case: Division by zero
| 5. Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000L | 2.0 | 0.0 | //Handles large numbers correctly
| 6. Decimal Numbers | 2.5 | 1.5 | 4.0 | 1.0 | 3.75 | 1.6666666666666667 | 1.0 |
| 7. Mixed Signs | -10 | 5 | -5 | -15 | -50 | -2.0 | -0.0 |
| 8. Integer overflow (potential corner case*) | Integer.MAX_VALUE | 1  | Overflow, likely becomes negative |  Integer.MAX_VALUE -1 |  Integer.MAX_VALUE | Integer.MAX_VALUE | 0 |
| 9. Integer underflow (potential corner case*) | Integer.MIN_VALUE | -1  | Underflow, likely becomes positive | Integer.MIN_VALUE + 1  | Overflow (large positive value)| Integer.MIN_VALUE | 0 |




*Note on Integer Overflow/Underflow:*  If `num1` and `num2` are integers (declared as `int` instead of `double`), and the arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of `int`, overflow or underflow will occur.  The result will "wrap around" (e.g., adding 1 to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` results in `Integer.MIN_VALUE`).  The test cases above with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE`  are intended to demonstrate this if you were using `int` variables.  With `double`, you have a much wider range and are less likely to encounter this issue in typical calculations.



**How to Run the Tests (Manually):**

1.  **Save:** Save the Java code as `ArithmeticOperations.java`.
2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac ArithmeticOperations.java`
3.  **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java ArithmeticOperations`
4.  **Input:** The program will prompt you to enter two numbers. Enter the values from each test case and verify the output matches the expected values.


You could also automate these tests with JUnit or another testing framework. This would be recommended in a professional setting.
