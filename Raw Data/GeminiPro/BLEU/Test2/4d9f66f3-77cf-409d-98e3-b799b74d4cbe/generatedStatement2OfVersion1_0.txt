   Quotient: 2.0
   Remainder: 0.0

2. **Input:** num1 = 7.5, num2 = 2.5
   **Expected Output:**
   Sum: 10.0
   Difference: 5.0
   Product: 18.75
   Quotient: 3.0
   Remainder: 0.0

3. **Input:** num1 = -8, num2 = 3
   **Expected Output:**
   Sum: -5.0
   Difference: -11.0
   Product: -24.0
   Quotient: -2.6666666666666665
   Remainder: -2.0


**Corner Cases:**

4. **Division by Zero:** num1 = 10, num2 = 0
   **Expected Output:**
   Sum: 10.0
   Difference: 10.0
   Product: 0.0
   Division by zero is not allowed.

5. **Large Numbers:** num1 = Double.MAX_VALUE, num2 = Double.MAX_VALUE  (Test for overflow)
   **Expected Output:** (Results may vary slightly due to floating-point representation)
   Sum: Infinity
   Difference: 0.0
   Product: Infinity
   Quotient: 1.0
   Remainder: NaN


6. **Small Numbers:** num1 = Double.MIN_VALUE, num2 = Double.MIN_VALUE (Test for underflow)
   **Expected Output:**  (Results may vary slightly due to floating-point representation)
   Sum: 4.4501477170144023E-308 // Or a very small number close to zero
   Difference: 0.0
   Product: 0.0  
   Quotient: 1.0
   Remainder: 0.0



7. **One number is zero:**  num1 = 0, num2 = 5
    **Expected Output:**
    Sum: 5.0
    Difference: -5.0
    Product: 0.0
    Quotient: 0.0
    Remainder: 0.0


8. **Both numbers are zero:** num1 = 0, num2 = 0
    **Expected Output:**
    Sum: 0.0
    Difference: 0.0
    Product: 0.0
    Division by zero is not allowed.




By running the program with these test cases, you can thoroughly verify that the arithmetic operations are being performed correctly and that the code handles potential issues like division by zero and overflow/underflow appropriately.  Remember that due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic, results with very large or very small numbers might not be precisely what you'd expect mathematically. Always compare with acceptable tolerances.
