**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -5 | -2 | -7 | -3 | 10 | 2.5 | -1 | // Remainder behavior can differ with negative numbers; check your environment
| 3. Zero and Positive | 0 | 8 | 8 | -8 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4. Positive and Zero | 7 | 0 | 7 | 7 | 0 | Division by zero error | Division by zero error | **Corner Case**
| 5. Zero and Zero | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Division by zero error | Division by zero error | **Corner Case**
| 6.  Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000 | 2 | 0 |
| 7. Decimal Numbers | 2.5 | 1.2 | 3.7 | 1.3 | 3 | 2.0833333333333335 | 0.1 |
| 8.  Negative and Positive | -10 | 2 | -8 | -12 | -20 | -5 | 0 |
| 9. MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE | Double.MIN_VALUE | Double.MAX_VALUE | Double.MAX_VALUE (effectively) | -Double.MAX_VALUE (effectively) | Very small positive number, close to zero |  Very small positive number, close to zero | Double.MIN_VALUE (approximately)| **Corner Case (Overflow/Underflow potential)**



**How to Run Test Cases:**

While you could manually enter these values into the program, a more effective way to test is to write automated unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit. Here's a very basic example of how you might start with JUnit:
