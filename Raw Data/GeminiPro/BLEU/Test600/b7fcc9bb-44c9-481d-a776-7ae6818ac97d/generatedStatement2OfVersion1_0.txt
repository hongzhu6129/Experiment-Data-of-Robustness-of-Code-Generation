Explanation of "Beside":

A "beside" linked list (as the term seems to be used in this context) is one that *doesn't contain any duplicate elements*. It's as if each element sits uniquely "beside" the others without any repeats.  If there's a duplicate, they are on top of each other, so not beside.  An empty linked list can be considered "beside" as there are no elements to violate the no-duplicates rule.
