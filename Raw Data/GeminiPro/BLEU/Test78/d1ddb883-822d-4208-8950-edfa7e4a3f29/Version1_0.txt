```java
public class CheckSecurityManagerAndEnvVariables {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // 5. Check if a security manager is established
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            System.out.println("A security manager has been established.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No security manager has been established.");
        }

        // 90. Get environment variables
        String path = System.getenv("PATH");
        String temp = System.getenv("TEMP"); // Or TMP on some systems
        String username = System.getenv("USERNAME"); // Or USER on some systems like Linux/macOS


        if (path != null) {
            System.out.println("PATH: " + path);
        } else {
            System.out.println("PATH environment variable not found.");
        }


        if (temp != null) {
            System.out.println("TEMP: " + temp);
        } else {
            System.out.println("TEMP environment variable not found."); // Could also try TMP
        }


        if (username != null) {
            System.out.println("USERNAME: " + username); 
        } else {
            System.out.println("USERNAME environment variable not found."); // Could also try USER
        }

    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Output:** The output now explicitly states whether a security manager is present or not.  It also handles the case where an environment variable is not found, rather than printing `null`.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** For the `TEMP` and `USERNAME` environment variables, the code now acknowledges that different operating systems might use slightly different names (e.g., `TMP` instead of `TEMP`, `USER` instead of `USERNAME`).  It provides suggestions for alternatives if the primary variable isn't found.
* **Error Handling (for environment variables):** Checks if the environment variables are null before printing them to avoid NullPointerExceptions.
* **Conciseness:** The code remains concise and easy to understand.
* **Best Practices:** Uses `System.getenv()` which is the recommended way to access environment variables in Java.


To compile and run:

1. Save the code as `CheckSecurityManagerAndEnvVariables.java`.
2. Compile: `javac CheckSecurityManagerAndEnvVariables.java`
3. Run: `java CheckSecurityManagerAndEnvVariables`


The output will show whether a security manager is set and the values of the specified environment variables (or a message if they are not defined).
