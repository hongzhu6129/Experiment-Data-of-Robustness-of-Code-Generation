Key Improvements and Explanations:

1. **Handles Null and Empty Inputs:** The code now explicitly checks for `null` or empty input strings and returns the other string as appropriate. This prevents `NullPointerExceptions`.

2. **Clearer Conversion to Integer:** The code uses `charAt(i) - '0'` to convert characters to integers.  This is more explicit and easier to understand than implicit conversions.

3. **Uses ArrayList for Result:** Using an `ArrayList` to store the result bits makes the code simpler and more efficient, as it avoids the need to pre-calculate the size of the result array.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes a variety of test cases covering normal scenarios, corner cases (zeros, empty strings), and even a test with longer strings to check efficiency. The tests now print "PASSED" or "FAILED" for clarity.

5. **StringBuilder for String Construction:**  Using `StringBuilder` to build the final binary string is more efficient than string concatenation, especially for larger binary numbers.



How to Run:

1. Save the code as `BinaryAdder.java`.
2. Compile: `javac BinaryAdder.java`
3. Run: `java BinaryAdder`


The output will show the results of each test case, indicating whether it passed or failed.
