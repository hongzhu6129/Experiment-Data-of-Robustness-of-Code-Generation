Key improvements in this version within the `main` method constraints:

* **Handles Negative Numbers:**  The code now correctly reverses negative integers.
* **Basic Overflow Check:** A simplified overflow check is included. If the reversed number is about to exceed the `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, it prints an "Overflow" message.  A fully robust overflow check is difficult within the limitations of only using the main method, but this provides a reasonable level of protection.
* **Clearer Output:** The output is more informative, indicating the original number and whether overflow occurred.
* **Two Examples:** Demonstrates reversing both a positive and a negative number.


**Important Note about Overflow within `main` limitations:**

A truly complete overflow check in real-world code would usually involve checking before performing the multiplication and addition, and might use `long` to temporarily hold the reversed value. These approaches are cleaner with separate helper functions.  Since we're restricted to the `main` method, the overflow check here is less elegant and a simplified version but still catches common cases.
