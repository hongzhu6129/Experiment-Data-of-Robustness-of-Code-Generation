Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:**  The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` during image saving. This makes the code more robust.
2. **Clearer Output:**  Prints a message to the console indicating where the image has been saved or if there was an error.
3. **Resource Management:**  `g.dispose()` is added to release the graphics context resources, which is good practice.
4. **Image File Path:** Creates the output file `division_result.png` in the project's directory (the directory where you run the Java program from).
5. **Centering the Text:** The `x` and `y` coordinates for drawing the text are calculated to center the text both horizontally and vertically on the image, making it look much better.


To run this code:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DivideAndPrintOnImage.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:  `javac DivideAndPrintOnImage.java`
3. **Run:**  `java DivideAndPrintOnImage`

This will generate an image file named `division_result.png` in the same directory, displaying the division result on a white background.
