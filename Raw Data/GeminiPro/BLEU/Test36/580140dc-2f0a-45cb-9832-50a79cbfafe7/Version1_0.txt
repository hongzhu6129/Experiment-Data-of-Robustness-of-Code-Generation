```java
public class TwinkleTwinkle {

    public static void printFormattedTwinkle() {
        System.out.println("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,");
        System.out.println("\tHow I wonder what you are!");
        System.out.println("\t\tUp above the world so high,");
        System.out.println("\t\tLike a diamond in the sky.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printFormattedTwinkle();
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

While this specific program doesn't have complex logic susceptible to traditional corner cases (like invalid input or edge conditions), we can still consider some testing aspects:

1. **Standard Output Test:**  Verify the output matches the desired format exactly.  This confirms basic functionality.  Compare the program's printed output to the expected output string:

   ```
   Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
       How I wonder what you are!
           Up above the world so high,
           Like a diamond in the sky.
   ```

2. **Whitespace Sensitivity Test:** Pay close attention to the whitespace (tabs and newlines). Even a single incorrect space or tab will change the formatting. The test should explicitly check for the correct indentation using tabs (`\t`).


3. **Platform Independence Test (Optional but Good Practice):**  Although less critical here, it's a good idea to test on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to ensure consistent output regarding newline characters. Java handles newlines relatively well cross-platform, but variations can sometimes occur.  You could automate this with a testing framework if you had a larger project.


4. **Character Encoding Test (Optional for advanced scenarios):** If your program were to handle international characters or different encodings (like UTF-8, UTF-16), you would want to test with strings containing those characters to ensure they are printed correctly.  This is not a concern with the basic "Twinkle Twinkle" text.


**Example of a Basic JUnit Test (using JUnit 5):**

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class TwinkleTwinkleTest {

    @Test
    void testPrintFormattedTwinkle() {
        ByteArrayOutputStream outContent = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        System.setOut(new PrintStream(outContent));

        TwinkleTwinkle.printFormattedTwinkle();

        String expectedOutput = "Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\r\n" + // \r\n for Windows, \n for others
                                "\tHow I wonder what you are!\r\n" +
                                "\t\tUp above the world so high,\r\n" + 
                                "\t\tLike a diamond in the sky.\r\n"; // Adjust \r\n as needed for your OS

        // For platform independence (handles both \r\n and \n):
        String actualOutput = outContent.toString().replaceAll("\\r\\n?", "\n"); 
        assertEquals(expectedOutput, actualOutput);

        System.setOut(System.out); // Restore standard output
    }
}
```


This JUnit example captures the output of the `printFormattedTwinkle()` method and compares it to the expected output string, ensuring the formatting is correct.  The `replaceAll` part is for platform independence, handling differences in newline characters between operating systems.
