2. **Character Encoding:** Although less likely an issue in modern Java environments, ensure the output is correctly encoded to display special characters like commas and apostrophes correctly. This is more important if you were dealing with international characters.

3. **Platform Independence:**  Java is designed to be platform-independent.  Run the program on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to confirm consistent output.  The tab character (`\t`) should ideally produce consistent spacing, though its visual representation might vary slightly between environments (tab stops).

4. **Empty Input/No Arguments:**  This program doesn't take any command-line arguments, so there aren't any "corner cases" related to invalid input. The `main` method is simple.

5. **Output Redirection:**  While not strictly a test of the program's logic, you could redirect the output to a file to check if the formatting is preserved:
