Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer `minmax` function:** Now returns both the index and value of the maximum element, making its purpose more evident.
* **Recursive `sort` function:**  This is a more standard and elegant way to implement pancake sort.  It handles the base case (size 1) and the recursive calls efficiently.
* **Correct Flipping Logic:** The flips are performed correctly to bring the maximum element to the end of the current subarray.
* **Adherence to Method Signatures:** The code strictly uses only the specified method signatures.
* **Example Usage in `main`:** Demonstrates how to use the `PancakeSort` class with different input arrays.
* **Comments:**  Explanatory comments added to make the code easier to understand.
