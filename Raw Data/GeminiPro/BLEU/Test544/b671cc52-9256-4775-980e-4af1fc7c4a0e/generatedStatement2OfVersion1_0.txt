To compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FileSize.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:  `javac FileSize.java`
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program with the filename as an argument: `java FileSize myfile.txt`  (Replace `myfile.txt` with the actual path to your file).


Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Error Handling:** Checks for invalid file paths or if the provided path is not a file. Provides a helpful usage message if no filename is given.
* **Clear Output:**  Formats the KB and MB output to two decimal places for better readability.
* **Uses `long` for bytes:**  `file.length()` returns a `long`, so using `long` instead of `double` to store the size in bytes avoids potential precision loss for very large files.



This makes the code more robust and user-friendly.
