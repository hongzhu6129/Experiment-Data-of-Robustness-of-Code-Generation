Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n`: Total number of coins.
   - `k`: Every k-th row has k coins.
   - `currentRow`: Keeps track of the current row number.
   - `coinsUsed`: Counts how many coins have been used so far.

2. **Loop:** The `while` loop continues as long as `coinsUsed` is less than `n`.

3. **k-th Row Check:** Inside the loop, we check if the `currentRow` is a multiple of `k` (using the modulo operator `%`).

4. **k-th Row Logic:** If it's a k-th row:
   - We check if we have enough coins remaining to place `currentRow` (which is also `k`) coins.
   - If enough coins, prints "O " `k` times (representing the coins) and update `coinsUsed`.
   - If not enough coins, prints the remaining coins and sets `coinsUsed` to `n` to exit the loop.


5. **Non-k-th Row Logic:**  If it's not a `k`th row:
    - Print  "O " `currentRow` times (representing the coins), and update `coinsUsed`.
    - Handle case where remaining coins less than `currentRow`:  Print remaining coins.


6. **Increment Row:** After each row is printed, `currentRow` is incremented.

7. **Output:** The code prints the staircase pattern to the console.


Example Usage:
If `n = 6` and `k = 2`:
