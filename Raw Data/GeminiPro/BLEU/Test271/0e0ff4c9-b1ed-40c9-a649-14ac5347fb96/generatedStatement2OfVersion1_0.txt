Explanation and Key Improvements:

1. Clearer Variable Names:  `index` is more descriptive than `i`.

2.  Handles Edge Cases: The code now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` input arrays.

3.  Simplified Logic: The core logic is now more concise and readable by directly comparing the current element `num` with the element two positions back (`nums[index - 2]`). This avoids unnecessary temporary variables or nested conditions.

4.  Comprehensive Test Cases in `main()`:  The `main` method includes more test cases, demonstrating different scenarios, including edge cases like empty and null arrays, and cases where there are more than two duplicates.


5. Prints only Updated Portion: The `main` method now uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant, updated portion of the array after removing duplicates.  This avoids printing the unchanged "garbage" values at the end of the original array.



This improved version is more robust, readable, and efficient in handling various input scenarios.
