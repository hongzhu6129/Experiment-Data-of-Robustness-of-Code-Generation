**Test Cases and Corner Cases:**

1. **Positive Side Length:**  `sideLength = 5` (or any positive number).  This tests the standard calculation.

2. **Small Side Length:** `sideLength = 1` or `sideLength = 0.5`.  This checks if the formula works correctly for small values, ensuring no unexpected behavior like rounding errors causing significant inaccuracies.

3. **Large Side Length:** `sideLength = 100` or `sideLength = 1000`.  Tests behavior with larger numbers, again to check for potential overflow or rounding errors.

4. **Zero Side Length:** `sideLength = 0`. This is an invalid input. The program should handle this gracefully and not crash. My improved code includes an explicit check for this and other invalid inputs.

5. **Negative Side Length:** `sideLength = -5`.  This is another invalid input. The program should handle this appropriately,  providing an error message like the updated code does.  A hexagon cannot have a negative side length.


**How to run the test cases:**

Since the "test cases" are now incorporated directly into `main`, you'll see the test results printed to the console after you provide an initial side length as input when you run the program.


**Important Note:**  While the prompt asks for everything to be in `main`, this isn't good practice for real-world programs.  Ideally, you would separate the area calculation logic into its own method and have separate test methods (using a testing framework like JUnit) to keep your code organized, testable, and maintainable.   The provided code fulfills the prompt's unusual constraints but wouldn't be the recommended structure for a production-quality application.
