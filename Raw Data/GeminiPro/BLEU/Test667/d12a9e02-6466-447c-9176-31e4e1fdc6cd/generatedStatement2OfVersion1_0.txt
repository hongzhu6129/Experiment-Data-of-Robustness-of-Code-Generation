This educational example demonstrates:

1. **Creating a `TreeMap`:**  `TreeMap` is a sorted map implementation that implements the `NavigableMap` interface.
2. **Populating the Map:** Adding key-value pairs (student scores).
3. **`headMap()` with Inclusive:** `headMap(toKey, inclusive)` gets the portion of the map whose keys are less than or equal to `toKey` if `inclusive` is true.
4. **`headMap()` with Exclusive:** Demonstrates getting the submap with keys strictly less than `toKey`.
5. **Practical Use Case:** Shows how `headMap` can be used in a real-world scenario (finding students below a passing grade).
6. **Empty `headMap` Handling:** Shows how to handle the case where `headMap` returns an empty map if there are no elements satisfying the condition.
7. **Helper Function:** The `printMap` function simplifies printing the map contents.
