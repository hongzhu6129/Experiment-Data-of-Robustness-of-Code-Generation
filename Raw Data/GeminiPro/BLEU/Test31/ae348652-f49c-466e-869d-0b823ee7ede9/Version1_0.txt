```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class EarthDistance {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Input the latitude of coordinate 1: ");
        double lat1 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());

        System.out.print("Input the longitude of coordinate 1: ");
        double lon1 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());

        System.out.print("Input the latitude of coordinate 2: ");
        double lat2 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());

        System.out.print("Input the longitude of coordinate 2: ");
        double lon2 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble());

        double earthRadius = 6371.01; // Earth's radius in kilometers

        double distance = earthRadius * Math.acos(Math.sin(lat1) * Math.sin(lat2) + Math.cos(lat1) * Math.cos(lat2) * Math.cos(lon1 - lon2));

        System.out.println("The distance between the two points is: " + distance);
        input.close();
    }
}

**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Example Case (Provided):**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -70
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

3. **Opposite Sides of the Earth (Antipodes):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 110 
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.09 km (approximately Earth's diameter)

4. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0  (Longitude doesn't matter at poles)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.09 km

5. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 180
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.09 km

6. **Points near the International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 10
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 10
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Distance: ~222.64 km (small distance due to date line crossing)

7. **Invalid Input (Boundary Conditions):**
   - lat1: -91 (outside valid range)
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 0
   - Expected:  The program should ideally handle this gracefully, either by throwing an exception or printing an error message. Latitude values must be between -90 and +90 inclusive. Similarly, longitude values are between -180 and 180 inclusive.


**How to Use Test Cases:**

1. **Manual Testing:**  Input these values into your program and verify the calculated distance matches the expected distance (within a reasonable tolerance due to floating-point calculations).
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  Create unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit.  This allows you to run the tests automatically and ensure your code remains correct even after making changes.  Here is an example of a JUnit test:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;


class EarthDistanceTest {

    @Test
    void calculateDistance_samePoint_returnsZero() {
        double distance = EarthDistance.calculateDistance(40, -70, 40, -70);  // Assuming you create a calculateDistance method
        assertEquals(0, distance, 0.001); // delta for tolerance
    }


    //Add tests for other cases here
}
```



By using these test cases, you can thoroughly verify the correctness of your Earth distance calculation program.  It's good practice to include a range of inputs, including typical values, edge cases, and invalid inputs, to ensure robustness.
