**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner and edge cases, along with expected outputs (approximate due to floating-point calculations).  You can put these in a separate testing class using a testing framework like JUnit or TestNG for automated testing.


1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Output: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -70
   - Expected Output: 0 km

3. **Opposite Sides of Earth (Antipodes):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 110 
   - Expected Output: ~20015.09 km (close to Earth's diameter)

4. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0   (Longitude doesn't matter at the poles)
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0
   - Expected Output: ~20015.09 km

5. **Equator Points:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 90
   - Expected Output: ~10007.54 km (quarter of Earth's circumference)


6. **Near Antipodal Points (to test floating-point precision):**
    - lat1: 89.999
    - lon1: 0
    - lat2: -89.999
    - lon2: 180
    - Expected output: ~20015.09 (should still be close to diameter)

7. **Invalid Input (Handling is left to the developer. The current code will crash with `InputMismatchException` if you enter non-numeric data.  You may want to add error handling):**
   - lat1: "abc" (or any non-double value)



Key improvements in the refined code:

- **Clarity and Readability:** More descriptive variable names and comments.
- **Error Prevention (optional):**  Consider adding input validation (e.g., using `try-catch` blocks) to gracefully handle invalid input like non-numeric data or latitudes/longitudes outside the acceptable range.


This comprehensive set of test cases will help ensure the correctness and robustness of your Java program. Remember to handle potential errors like invalid input gracefully.
