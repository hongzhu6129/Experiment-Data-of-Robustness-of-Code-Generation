**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner cases, to thoroughly test the program:

1. **Same Coordinates:**
   - lat1 = 25, lon1 = 35
   - lat2 = 25, lon2 = 35
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

2. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1 = 25, lon1 = 35
   - lat2 = 35.5, lon2 = 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

3. **Antipodes (Opposite sides of the Earth):**
   - lat1 = 45, lon1 = 0
   - lat2 = -45, lon2 = 180
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's diameter)

4. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1 = 90, lon1 = 0  (North Pole)
   - lat2 = -90, lon2 = 0 (South Pole)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km


5. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1 = 0, lon1 = 0
   - lat2 = 0, lon2 = 180
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km

6. **Points on the same longitude:**
   - lat1 = 30, lon1 = 45
   - lat2 = 60, lon2 = 45
   - Expected Distance: ~3326.56 km



7. **Invalid Input (Latitude out of range):**
   - lat1 = 100, lon1 = 35  (Latitude should be between -90 and 90)
   - lat2 = 35.5, lon2 = 25.5
   - Expected: The program should ideally handle this gracefully, either by throwing an exception or displaying an error message.  Consider adding input validation to your code.


**How to Run Tests:**

You can manually input these values into your program or, better yet, create a separate test class using a testing framework like JUnit.  JUnit will let you automate these tests and verify the results against the expected values.  This is highly recommended, especially as your code gets more complex.


Example JUnit test (you'll need to add the JUnit library to your project):
