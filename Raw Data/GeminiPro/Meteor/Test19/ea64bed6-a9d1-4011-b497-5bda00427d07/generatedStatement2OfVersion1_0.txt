**Test Cases:**

1. **Empty Input:**
   - Input: ""
   - Expected Output: `Octal equivalent: 0`

2. **Invalid Input (Non-binary characters):**
   - Input: "101201"
   - Expected Output: `Invalid binary input.`

3. **Zero:**
   - Input: "0"
   - Expected Output: `Octal equivalent: 0`

4. **Single Binary Digit (1):**
   - Input: "1"
   - Expected Output: `Octal equivalent: 1`

5. **Small Binary Number:**
   - Input: "101"
   - Expected Output: `Octal equivalent: 5`

6. **Larger Binary Number:**
   - Input: "111010110"
   - Expected Output: `Octal equivalent: 726`

7. **Binary Number with Leading Zeros:**
   - Input: "000101"  
   - Expected Output: `Octal equivalent: 5`

8. **Maximum Integer Value (to avoid overflow in decimal conversion -  adjust as needed for your system):**
   - Input: "1111111111111111111111111111111" (32 ones - Java int max)
   - Expected Output: `Octal equivalent: 37777777777`



**Explanation of Corner Case Handling:**

- **Empty Input:**  Handles the case where the user enters nothing.
- **Invalid Input:** Checks for characters other than '0' and '1'.
- **Leading Zeros:** The code correctly handles leading zeros by iterating from right to left during binary to decimal conversion.
- **Zero Value:** Specifically checks for an input of "0" to output "0". This is a special case, ensuring clean output and preventing an empty octal string.


This improved version addresses the potential integer overflow by using `long` for decimal representation where appropriate and includes more comprehensive test cases.  It also makes the output more consistent and user-friendly.
