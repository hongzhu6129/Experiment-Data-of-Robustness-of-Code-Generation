```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ExplainPlainTextFile {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length != 1) {
            System.out.println("Usage: java ExplainPlainTextFile <filename>");
            return;
        }

        String filename = args[0];

        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename))) {
            String line;
            int lineNumber = 1;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                // Basic explanation: Print the line number and the line content.
                System.out.println("Line " + lineNumber + ": " + line);

                // Add more sophisticated explanations here based on the content of the file.
                // Example: Check for specific keywords, count words, analyze sentence structure, etc.

                // Example of a simple word count:
                String[] words = line.split("\\s+"); // Split the line into words
                System.out.println("    Word count: " + words.length);



                lineNumber++;

                 //Example: Check for specific keywords
                if (line.contains("error") || line.contains("warning")) {
                    System.out.println("    Potential issue detected on this line!");
                }

            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation and How to Use:**

1. **Compile:** Save the code as `ExplainPlainTextFile.java` and compile it using a Java compiler:
   ```bash
   javac ExplainPlainTextFile.java
   ```

2. **Run:** Execute the compiled program, providing the path to your plain text file as a command-line argument:
   ```bash
   java ExplainPlainTextFile my_text_file.txt 
   ```
   Replace `my_text_file.txt` with the actual filename.

3. **Output:** The program will print each line of the file along with its line number and the word count for that line. It also demonstrates a basic check for keywords like "error" or "warning".

**Key Improvements & Features:**

* **Error Handling:**  The code uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that might occur if the file doesn't exist or there are problems reading it. This makes the program more robust.
* **Command-Line Arguments:** The program now takes the filename as a command-line argument, making it more flexible and reusable.  It also checks if a filename was provided.
* **Basic Explanation:** The code provides a basic explanation by printing the line number and line content.
* **Word Count Example:** It calculates and prints the word count for each line.
* **Keyword Check Example:** Demonstrates how to check for specific words within a line (e.g., "error", "warning").

**Further Enhancements (To Add More Sophisticated Explanations):**

* **Content-Specific Analysis:**  You can tailor the explanations based on the type of file you are processing.  For example:
    * If it's a log file, you could parse timestamps, error codes, etc.
    * If it's a configuration file, you could explain the meaning of each setting.
* **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions for more complex pattern matching and analysis.
* **Data Structures:** Store data extracted from the file in appropriate data structures (e.g., lists, maps) for further processing and reporting.
* **Output Formatting:** Improve the output formatting to make it clearer and easier to understand.


This improved version is more practical, user-friendly, and provides a good starting point for adding more sophisticated explanations depending on your specific requirements.
