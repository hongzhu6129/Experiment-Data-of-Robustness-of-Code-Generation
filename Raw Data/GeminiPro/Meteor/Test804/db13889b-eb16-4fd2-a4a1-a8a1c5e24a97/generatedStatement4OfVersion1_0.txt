Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Formatting:**  Uses nested loops to create the distinct sections (stars and stripes).
* **Correct "pct" Placement:**  The "pct" is now correctly placed in the specified location.
* **Consistent Spacing:** The spacing between stars and stripes and the length of the stripes are now more consistent and accurate.
* **Simplified Code:** Removes unnecessary variables and calculations, making the logic easier to follow.
* **Comments:**  Includes comments to explain the purpose of different code sections.


This revised code provides a much better representation of the requested flag within the constraints of the `main` method.
