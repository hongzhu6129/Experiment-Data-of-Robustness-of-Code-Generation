Key improvements:

* **Handles Edge Cases:** The `beadSort` method now correctly handles `null` or empty input arrays by returning an empty array.  It also uses `Arrays.stream().max().orElse(0)` to safely get the maximum value even if the array is empty.
* **Clearer Bead Representation:**  The code uses '*' to represent beads and ' ' for empty spaces, making the visualization easier to understand.
* **Correct Bead Falling Simulation:** The bead falling logic is now correctly implemented using nested loops and counters to simulate the beads dropping to the bottom.
* **Added Example Usage:** The `main` method includes examples of how to use the `display1D` methods for both `int` and `char` arrays, and the `display2D` method for `char[][]`, as requested.
* **Comments and Formatting:** Improved comments and formatting make the code more readable and understandable.


This revised version addresses the potential issues and provides a more robust and clear implementation of the Bead Sort algorithm along with the required display methods.
