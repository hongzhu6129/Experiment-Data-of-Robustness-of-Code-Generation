Key improvements in this version:

* **Locale Handling:** Uses `Locale.getDefault()` and `WeekFields.of(locale)` to correctly determine the first day of the week based on the user's locale.  This is crucial for internationalization, as different regions have different week start days (Sunday or Monday).
* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle the potential `DateTimeException` that can occur if a week number (e.g., 53) doesn't exist in the current year.  The program now exits the loop gracefully when it reaches a non-existent week.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Improved variable names and comments make the code easier to understand.
* **Efficiency:**  Calculates the last day of the week by adding 6 days to the first day, which is slightly more efficient than using another `with()` call.


Example Output (will vary based on the current date and locale):

```
Week 1: 2024-01-01 - 2024-01-07
Week 2: 2024-01-08 - 2024-01-14
Week 3: 2024-01-15 - 2024-01-21
...
Week 52: 2024-12-23 - 2024-12-29 
```
