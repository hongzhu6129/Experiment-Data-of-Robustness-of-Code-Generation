**Test Cases:**

1. **Valid Binary Input:**
   - Input: `1101`
   - Expected Output: `Hexadecimal value: d`

2. **Valid Binary Input with Leading Zeros:**
   - Input: `0001101`
   - Expected Output: `Hexadecimal value: d`

3. **Zero Input:**
   - Input: `0`
   - Expected Output: `Hexadecimal value: 0`

4. **Empty Input:**
   - Input: `` (empty string)
   - Expected Output: `Invalid binary number: ` (or a similar error message indicating invalid input)

5. **Invalid Binary Input (contains characters other than 0 and 1):**
   - Input: `110a1`
   - Expected Output: `Invalid binary number: 110a1`

6. **Large Binary Input:**
   - Input: `1111111111111111` (16 ones)
   - Expected Output: `Hexadecimal value: ffff`

7. **Corner Case - Maximum Integer Value:**  The biggest possible binary you can directly represent as an `int` in this code would convert to `7fffffff` in hex (because of the signed int limit).  Anything exceeding that in binary would cause an overflow before the hex conversion even starts, giving incorrect hex output. To improve this the program would need to handle binary as a `String` all the way through the calculation instead of relying on `int` or `long`.

8. **Corner Case - Exceeding `long`:** If using `long` to handle bigger numbers, eventually extremely large binary inputs would exceed even the `long` capacity, requiring a more sophisticated `BigInteger` based approach for truly robust input handling.


These test cases cover various scenarios, including valid inputs, inputs with leading zeros, invalid inputs, large inputs, and edge cases (empty and zero inputs). This comprehensive testing helps ensure the program functions correctly under different conditions.
