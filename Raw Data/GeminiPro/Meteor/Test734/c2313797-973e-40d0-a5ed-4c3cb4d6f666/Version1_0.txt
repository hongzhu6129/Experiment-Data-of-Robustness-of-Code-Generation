Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature:**  The `Saddleback` method now has a more descriptive name and returns an `int[]` to represent the row and column index.

2. **Returns -1 for Not Found:**  The method returns `{-1, -1}` if the target element is not found, making it easy to check the result in `main`.

3. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function and how to handle the case where the element is not found.  It also includes a test case where the target value does *not* exist.

4. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic within the `Saddleback` method.

5. **Efficient Saddleback Search:** The core logic of the `Saddleback` search is correctly implemented: start from the top-right corner, and move down if the target is larger or left if the target is smaller.

6. **Boundary Checks:** The `while` loop condition `row < m && col >= 0` ensures that the search stays within the bounds of the array.


This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and provides a clear way to handle cases where the target value isn't present in the 2D array.
