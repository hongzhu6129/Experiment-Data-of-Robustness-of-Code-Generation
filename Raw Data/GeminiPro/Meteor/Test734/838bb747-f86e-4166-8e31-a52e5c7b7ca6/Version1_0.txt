Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signatures:**  The requested method signatures are used correctly.

2. **Return an Array for Coordinates:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` containing the row and column indices of the target.  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.  This is a standard and efficient way to handle returning multiple values.

3. **Efficient Saddleback Search:** The `Saddleback` method implements the algorithm correctly. It starts at the top-right corner and efficiently eliminates rows or columns based on the target value.

4. **Clearer Example in `main`:** The `main` method provides a clear example of how to use the `Saddleback` method and how to interpret the results.  I've also added a test case where the target is not found.

5. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic.


How the Saddleback Search works:

The algorithm utilizes the sorted nature of the 2D array. It starts at the top right.

- If the current element is equal to the target, we've found it.
- If the current element is smaller than the target, we move down to the next row (since values increase as we move down).
- If the current element is larger than the target, we move left to the previous column (since values decrease as we move left).

This process continues until we either find the target or exhaust the search space (go out of bounds).
