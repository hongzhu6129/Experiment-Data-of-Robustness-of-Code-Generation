Key improvements:

* **Efficiency:** The inner loop now starts from `a + 1`. This avoids redundant calculations (e.g., 1� + 2� and 2� + 1� are the same) and ensures that we only count distinct pairs of cubes.
* **Clarity:** Added comments explaining the logic and purpose of the loops.
* **Demonstration:** The code now prints the pairs of cubes that sum to the found number.
* **Early Exit:** The `return` statement after finding the first such number makes the code more efficient. If you want to find *all* such numbers up to `n`, remove the `return` statement.
* **Correctness:**  Addresses the original problem statement accurately by checking for *at least two* distinct pairs.
