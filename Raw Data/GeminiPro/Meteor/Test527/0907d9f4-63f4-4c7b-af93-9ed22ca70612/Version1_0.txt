```java
public class Ramanujan {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1729; //  You can change this value to search up to a different limit

        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            int a3 = a * a * a;
            if (a3 > n) {
                break; // Optimization: No need to check further if a^3 exceeds n
            }

            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) { // Start b from a+1 to avoid duplicates and ensure distinct pairs
                int b3 = b * b * b;
                if (a3 + b3 > n) {
                    break; // Optimization: No need to check further if a^3 + b^3 exceeds n
                }

                for (int c = a + 1; c <= n; c++) {
                    int c3 = c * c * c;
                    if (c3 > n) {
                        break;
                    }
                    if (c == b) continue; // Ensure (c,d) is a distinct pair from (a,b)

                    for (int d = c + 1; d <= n; d++) {  // Start d from c + 1 for distinct pairs
                        int d3 = d * d * d;

                        if (c3 + d3 > n) {
                            break;
                        }


                        if (a3 + b3 == c3 + d3) {
                            System.out.println(a3 + b3 + " = " + a + "^3 + " + b + "^3 = " + c + "^3 + " + d + "^3");
                            return; // Exit after finding the first such number
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Distinct Pairs:** The code explicitly ensures that (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct pairs. This is crucial to meet the problem's requirement of "two (or more) *different* ways."  The loops and `if (c == b) continue;` condition handle this.
2. **Optimization:** The `break` statements within the loops significantly improve efficiency.  There's no need to continue checking if `a^3`, `a^3 + b^3`, or `c^3` already exceeds `n`.
3. **Clarity:** The code is formatted for better readability and includes comments to explain the logic.
4. **Correctness:** The code now accurately finds the smallest such number (typically 1729).
5. **`return` after finding a solution:**  The `return;` statement exits the `main` method as soon as a Ramanujan number is found, as per the problem's request to find *any* such number.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:  `javac Ramanujan.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled program: `java Ramanujan`

The output for `n = 1729` will be:

```
1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3 
```
