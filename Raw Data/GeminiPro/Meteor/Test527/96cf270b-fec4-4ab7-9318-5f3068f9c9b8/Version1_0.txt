```java
public class Ramanujan {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1729; // You can change this value to search up to a different limit

        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            int a3 = a * a * a;
            if (a3 > n) {
                break; // Optimization: No need to continue if a^3 exceeds n
            }

            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) { // Start b from a+1 to avoid duplicates
                int b3 = b * b * b;
                if (a3 + b3 > n) {
                    break; // Optimization: No need to continue if a^3 + b^3 exceeds n
                }

                for (int c = 1; c <= n; c++) {
                    int c3 = c * c * c;
                    if (c3 > n) {
                       break;
                    }

                    for (int d = c + 1; d <= n; d++) { // Start d from c+1 to avoid duplicates
                        int d3 = d * d * d;
                        if (c3 + d3 > n) {
                            break;
                        }


                        if (a3 + b3 == c3 + d3  && (a != c || b != d) && a3 + b3 <= n) {
                            System.out.println(a3 + b3 + " = " + a + "^3 + " + b + "^3 = " + c + "^3 + " + d + "^3");
                            return; // Exit after finding the first such number.  Remove this line if you want to find all such numbers up to n.
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }


    }

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Readability:** Variable names (a, b, c, d) clearly represent the components of the sums of cubes.
2. **Efficiency:**
   - The code now avoids redundant calculations by storing the cubes (a3, b3, c3, d3).
   - `break` statements are used within loops to exit early when further calculations are unnecessary (e.g., when `a3` exceeds `n`).
3. **Correctness:** The code ensures that `b` starts from `a + 1` and `d` starts from `c + 1` to prevent duplicate pairs and to enforce distinct pairs (a, b) and (c, d). The comparison `(a != c || b != d)` ensures that the two representations are distinct.
4. **Adherence to Problem Statement:** The code now adheres strictly to the prompt by only including the `main` method.  It also returns after finding the *first* Ramanujan number (1729), just like the original Princeton example. You can remove the `return` statement if you want to find *all* Ramanujan numbers within the given range.



This revised version is significantly more efficient and easier to understand, addressing the issues and inefficiencies present in earlier versions.
