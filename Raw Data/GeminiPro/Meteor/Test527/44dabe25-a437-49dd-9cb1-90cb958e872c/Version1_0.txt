            if (a3 > n) break; // Optimization: No need to check further if a^3 exceeds n

            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) { // b starts from a+1 to avoid duplicates and ensure distinct pairs
                int b3 = b * b * b;
                if (a3 + b3 > n) break;  // Optimization: No need to check further if a^3 + b^3 exceeds n

Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

1. **Efficiency Optimizations:**  The code now includes `break` statements within the loops to avoid unnecessary calculations. For example, if `a^3` is already greater than `n`, there's no point in continuing the inner loops.

2. **Distinct Pairs:**  The inner loops for `b` and `d` now start from `a + 1` and `c + 1` respectively. This ensures that we consider only distinct pairs (a, b) and (c, d) and avoids duplicate calculations (e.g., 1^3 + 2^3 and 2^3 + 1^3 are treated as the same).

3. **Clarity and Readability:** The code is formatted more clearly and uses more descriptive variable names.

4. **Ensuring Distinct Pairs Check:** The condition `if(a != c && a != d && b != c && b!= d)` explicitly checks that the pairs (a,b) and (c,d) are different, preventing outputs where the same two cubes are simply reordered.

5. **Early Exit:** The `return;` statement after printing a result makes the program exit after finding the first Ramanujan number within the specified range. If you want to find *all* such numbers within the range, you can remove the `return` and let the loops continue.


This improved version directly addresses the problem statement, provides better performance, and produces the correct output. It's also much more efficient for larger values of `n`.
