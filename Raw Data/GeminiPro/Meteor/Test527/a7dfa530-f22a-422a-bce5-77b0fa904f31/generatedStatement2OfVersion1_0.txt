Key improvements in this version:

* **Efficiency:**  The code now pre-computes the cubes, significantly reducing redundant calculations within the nested loops.
* **Clarity:**  The code is more clearly structured and commented.
* **Correctness:**  The loops are structured to avoid duplicate combinations (e.g., 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 is the same as 2^3 + 1^3 + 3^3). The loop conditions `b=a`, `c=b`, etc., ensure we only count each combination once.
* **Early Exit:**  The code exits after finding the first number that meets the criteria, improving efficiency.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes a message if no number is found within the given range.


This improved version will run much faster and is more likely to find a solution within a reasonable timeframe, especially for larger values of `n`.  Remember to adjust `n` as needed.  The original Ramanujan number (1729) should be found fairly quickly.
