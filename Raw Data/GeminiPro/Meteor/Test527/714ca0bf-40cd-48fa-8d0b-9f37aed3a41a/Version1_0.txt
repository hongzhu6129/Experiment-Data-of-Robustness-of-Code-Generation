```java
public class Ramanujan {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1729; // Example value, you can change this

        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) { // Ensure b > a to avoid duplicate pairs
                int sum = a * a * a + b * b * b;

                if (sum <= n) {
                    int count = 0;
                    for (int c = 1; c < b ; c++) { // Iterate through potential pairs (c,d) where c<b to prevent duplicates
                        for (int d = c + 1; d <= n; d++) { // Ensure d > c to avoid duplicate pairs within the inner loop

                            if (c * c * c + d * d * d == sum) {
                                count++;
                                if(count >=1 && (c !=a || d!=b) ){ //Check if at least two pairs exist for the current sum and avoid duplicate
                                    System.out.println(sum + " = " + a + "^3 + " + b + "^3 = " + c + "^3 + " + d + "^3");
                                    return; // Exit after finding the first such number
                                }
                            }
                        }

                    }
                    

                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Efficiency:**  The code avoids redundant calculations by ensuring `b > a` in the outer loops and `d > c` in the inner loops. This prevents checking the same pair of cubes twice (e.g., 1^3 + 2^3 and 2^3 + 1^3).  The return statement in the main method will exit once we've found one number.

2. **Clarity:** Variables are more descriptively named (e.g., `sum`, `count`).

3. **Correctness:** The logic now accurately reflects the problem statement by only considering *distinct* pairs of cubes and by returning from main once we've confirmed that a sum can be represented by two different cube pairs. Added a check using `c != a || d != b` so that we don't return when the same pair is found again.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run `javac Ramanujan.java`.
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run `java Ramanujan`.



If you want to test with a larger `n`,  change the value of `n` in the `main` method. Keep in mind that the time complexity of the code increases.
