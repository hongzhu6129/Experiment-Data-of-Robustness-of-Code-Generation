Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Efficiency:**  The code avoids redundant calculations by ensuring `b > a` in the outer loops and `d > c` in the inner loops. This prevents checking the same pair of cubes twice (e.g., 1^3 + 2^3 and 2^3 + 1^3).  The return statement in the main method will exit once we've found one number.

2. **Clarity:** Variables are more descriptively named (e.g., `sum`, `count`).

3. **Correctness:** The logic now accurately reflects the problem statement by only considering *distinct* pairs of cubes and by returning from main once we've confirmed that a sum can be represented by two different cube pairs. Added a check using `c != a || d != b` so that we don't return when the same pair is found again.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run `javac Ramanujan.java`.
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run `java Ramanujan`.



If you want to test with a larger `n`,  change the value of `n` in the `main` method. Keep in mind that the time complexity of the code increases.
