**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **TreeSet Usage:** The code now uses a `TreeSet` which automatically stores elements in sorted order. This makes finding elements less than a certain value more efficient.

2. **`headSet()` Method:**  The most efficient way to get elements less than a value in a `TreeSet` is the `headSet()` method.  It returns a *view* of the portion of the `TreeSet` whose elements are strictly less than the specified element. The example shows how to use it.

3. **Inclusive vs. Exclusive:** `headSet(7)` is exclusive (it does *not* include 7 itself).  The code demonstrates how to achieve inclusivity if needed (using `headSet(7, true)` and then removing 7 or using streams and filtering).

4. **Looping (for demonstration):**  A loop is included to illustrate the basic comparison logic, but `headSet()` is generally preferred for efficiency with `TreeSet`.

5. **Java 8 Streams:** The example also shows how to accomplish the same thing with Java 8 streams (for those interested in more advanced techniques), which is a functional approach.

6. **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted to clearly show the original `TreeSet` and the results of each method.

7. **Comments:** Added comments throughout to explain each part of the code.



This improved version is more educational, demonstrates best practices, and provides several ways to achieve the desired outcome.  It highlights the power of `TreeSet` and its specialized methods for working with sorted sets.
