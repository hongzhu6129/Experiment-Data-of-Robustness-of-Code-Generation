**Explanation and Key improvements:**

1. **Clearer file path handling:**  The `filePath` is now a variable, making it easier to change.  Emphasize the importance of providing the correct path.

2. **List for storing lines:** Uses an `ArrayList` to store each line individually, which is a common and efficient way to handle file data.

3. **Try-with-resources:** This ensures that the `BufferedReader` is closed automatically, even if exceptions occur, preventing resource leaks.

4. **Robust error handling:** The `catch` block now provides more informative error messages and exits the program gracefully with an error code if the file cannot be read.

5. **Clear comments:** The code is well-commented, explaining each step of the process.

6. **Example usage:** The code demonstrates how to print the lines and how to combine them into a single string if required.

7. **StringBuilder for concatenation:**  If you need the entire file as a single string, using `StringBuilder` is much more efficient than string concatenation using `+`.


**To use this code:**

1. **Create a text file named `my_file.txt`** (or whatever you set `filePath` to) in the same directory as your Java file (or specify the full path).
2. **Put some text in the file.**
3. **Compile and run the Java code.**  The contents of the file will be printed to the console.
