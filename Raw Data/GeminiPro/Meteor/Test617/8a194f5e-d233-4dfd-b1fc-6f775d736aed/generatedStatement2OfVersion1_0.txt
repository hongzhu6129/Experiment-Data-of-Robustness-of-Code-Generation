**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **TreeSet Basics:** `TreeSet` in Java stores elements in a sorted order (by default, ascending) using a tree-like structure.  It implements the `NavigableSet` interface.

2. **`descendingSet()`:** This method is the most convenient way to get a *reverse view* of the `TreeSet`. It returns a `NavigableSet` that represents the same elements but in descending order.  **Crucially, this is a *view*, not a copy.** Any modifications made to the reversed set are reflected in the original `TreeSet` and vice versa.

3. **`descendingIterator()`:**  This method provides an iterator that traverses the `TreeSet` in descending order.  It's useful when you need to iterate through the elements in reverse without creating a separate view.

4. **View vs. Copy:** The example code emphasizes the distinction between a *view* and a *copy*. The `descendingSet()` method creates a view, so changes made through the view affect the original set. If you need a completely independent reversed copy, you'd have to create a new `TreeSet` and add the elements in reverse order manually.


**How to run this code:**

1. Save the code as `ReverseTreeSet.java`.
2. Compile: `javac ReverseTreeSet.java`
3. Run: `java ReverseTreeSet`
