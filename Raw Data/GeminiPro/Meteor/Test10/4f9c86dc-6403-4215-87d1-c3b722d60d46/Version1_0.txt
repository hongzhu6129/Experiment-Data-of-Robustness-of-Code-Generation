```java
public class PrintFace {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printFace();
    }

    public static void printFace() {
        System.out.println("  +\"\"\"\"\"+\n [| o o |] \n  |  ^  | \n  | '-' |\n  +-----+");
    }
}
```

**Test Cases (Conceptual - since output is visual):**

1. **Basic Test:**  Run the program and visually verify that the face prints correctly. It should resemble a simple smiley face.

2. **Character Encoding Test:**  Run the program on different systems/terminals with potentially different character encodings. Ensure the characters (", [, ], |, o, ^, -, +) display correctly and the face structure is maintained.  This tests for potential issues with special character representation.

3. **Output Redirection Test (Optional, for advanced testing):** Redirect the program's output to a file and then compare the file content with the expected output string. This allows for automated testing.  Example (in a *nix-like shell): `java PrintFace > output.txt`  Then compare `output.txt` with the expected face string.

4. **Whitespace Sensitivity Test (Not Applicable in this specific case):** While not strictly a corner case, in some output formatting scenarios, extra or missing spaces can disrupt the visual appearance.  In this simple face program, extra whitespace inside the string literals won't significantly affect the output because `println` prints the entire string as-is.  However, if you were building the face string dynamically, you'd need to be careful about whitespace.


**Example of Automated Testing (using JUnit - a Java testing framework):**

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class PrintFaceTest {

    @Test
    public void testPrintFace() {
        // Redirect System.out to capture the output
        ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        System.setOut(new PrintStream(outputStream));

        // Call the method to print the face
        PrintFace.printFace();

        // Get the printed output as a string
        String actualOutput = outputStream.toString();

        // Define the expected output
        String expectedOutput = "  +\"\"\"\"\"+\n [| o o |] \n  |  ^  | \n  | '-' |\n  +-----+\n";  // Note the \n at the end!

        // Assert that the actual output matches the expected output
        assertEquals(expectedOutput, actualOutput);

        // Restore System.out
        System.setOut(System.out); // Important to reset!
    }
}
```


This JUnit test demonstrates how to capture the output of `printFace()` and compare it with the expected string.  This makes testing more robust and repeatable than just visual inspection.  You would need to add JUnit to your project to run this test.


The provided test cases cover the essential aspects of verifying that the `printFace()` function produces the intended visual output and handles potential character encoding variations.  The JUnit example shows a more advanced and automated way to test output in Java.
