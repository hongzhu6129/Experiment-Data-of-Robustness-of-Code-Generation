**Problem Description:**

Write a Java program that takes a character as input and determines whether it is an alphabet or not. If it is an alphabet, then identify whether it is a vowel or a consonant.

**Code:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AlphabetIdentifier {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt the user to enter a character
        System.out.println("Enter a character: ");
        char character = scanner.next().charAt(0);

        // Check if the character is an alphabet
        if (Character.isAlphabetic(character)) {
            // Check if the character is a vowel
            if (character == 'a' || character == 'e' || character == 'i' || character == 'o' || character == 'u' ||
                    character == 'A' || character == 'E' || character == 'I' || character == 'O' || character == 'U') {
                System.out.println("The character " + character + " is a vowel.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("The character " + character + " is a consonant.");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("The character " + character + " is not an alphabet.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

**Valid inputs:**

* a
* O
* E
* z
* H

**Invalid inputs:**

* 1
* %
* &
* .

**Corner cases:**

* Empty input
* Input containing multiple characters
* Input containing non-ASCII characters
