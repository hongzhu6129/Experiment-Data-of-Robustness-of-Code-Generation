```java
public class DivisibleBy3And5 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Numbers divisible by 3:");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
            }
        }
        System.out.println(); // Newline for clarity

        System.out.println("\nNumbers divisible by 5:");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            if (i % 5 == 0) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
            }
        }
        System.out.println(); // Newline for clarity


        System.out.println("\nNumbers divisible by both 3 and 5:");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
            }
        }
        System.out.println(); // Newline for clarity
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

**1. Normal Cases:**

* **Input Range:** 1 to 100 (as specified)
* **Expected Output:** The program should correctly print numbers divisible by 3, 5, and both within this range.  For example, it should print 15, 30, 45, etc., for numbers divisible by both.

**2. Boundary Cases:**

* **Input Range:** 1 to 1  (smallest possible valid range)
* **Expected Output:** If 1 is divisible by 3 or 5 (it's not), it should be printed in the appropriate section.
* **Input Range:** 1 to 3 (includes a number divisible by 3)
* **Input Range:** 1 to 5 (includes a number divisible by 5)
* **Input Range:** 1 to 15 (includes the first number divisible by both)


**3. Corner Cases/Invalid Inputs (Though the program doesn't take direct input):**

* **Empty Range:** While the program doesn't take range input directly, consider a hypothetical scenario where the loop start is greater than the loop end (e.g., `for (int i = 101; i <= 100; i++)`). The program should not print anything.
* **Negative Numbers (Hypothetical):**  If the program *were* to accept input ranges including negative numbers (which it currently doesn't), you'd need to test how it handles them.  Does it produce the correct results for negative numbers divisible by 3 and/or 5?



**How to test effectively:**

1. **Manual Inspection:** Run the code and carefully check the output against the expected values for each case.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):** Use a testing framework like JUnit.  Write test methods that call the `main` method (you might want to refactor your code slightly to separate the logic into testable methods) and assert that the output matches what's expected. This allows for easy regression testing as you make changes to your code.


Example JUnit Test (requires refactoring the code slightly):

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class DivisibleBy3And5Test {

    @Test
    void testRange1To15() {
        ByteArrayOutputStream outContent = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); // Capture output
        System.setOut(new PrintStream(outContent));

        DivisibleBy3And5.main(new String[]{}); // Call main

        String expectedOutput = "..."; // Put the expected output string here
        assertEquals(expectedOutput, outContent.toString());

        System.setOut(System.out); // Restore standard output
    }

    // Add more test methods for other cases
}
```


By using a combination of manual inspection and automated testing, you can thoroughly validate your code and ensure that it works correctly for a wide range of scenarios.
