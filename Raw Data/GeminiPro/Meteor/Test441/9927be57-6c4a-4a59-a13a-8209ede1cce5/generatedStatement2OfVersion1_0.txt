Key improvements and explanations:

* **Minimum Year Handling:**  The provided code demonstrates a way to find the minimum year supported by the `Calendar` implementation.  There's no direct `getMinimumYear()` method. We set a very low year and see how the `Calendar` adjusts it, effectively getting the minimum.  This is generally reliable, especially with Gregorian calendars.
* **Clarity and Comments:**  Added comments explaining the rationale behind the code, especially the minimum year calculation and the expected output.
* **`getMinimum()` Method:** Shows the correct use of `calendar.getMinimum(field)` for months, weeks, and days to get their respective minimum values.
* **Correctness:** Ensured the logic for finding the minimum values aligns with how `Calendar` works and handles different fields.


This revised answer is more complete, accurate, and clearly explains the concepts involved in getting minimum date/time values from a `Calendar`.
