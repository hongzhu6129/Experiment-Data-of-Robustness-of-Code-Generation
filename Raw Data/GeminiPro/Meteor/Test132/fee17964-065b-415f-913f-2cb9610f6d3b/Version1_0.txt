```java
public class ApproximatePi {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Calculate pi with 5 terms
        double piApproximation5 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0 / 3.0) + (1.0 / 5.0) - (1.0 / 7.0) + (1.0 / 9.0) - (1.0 / 11.0));

        // Calculate pi with 6 terms
        double piApproximation6 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0 / 3.0) + (1.0 / 5.0) - (1.0 / 7.0) + (1.0 / 9.0) - (1.0 / 11.0) + (1.0/13.0));


        System.out.println("Approximation with 5 terms (1/11): " + piApproximation5);
        System.out.println("Approximation with 6 terms (1/13): " + piApproximation6); 
    }
}
```


Key improvements in this code:

* **Clarity:**  The code is much cleaner and easier to understand.  The comments clearly explain what each part does.
* **Correctness:** The formula implementation is now accurate, alternating the signs correctly and using the proper denominators.
* **Uses doubles:** Using `double` for the calculations ensures we're working with floating-point numbers for a more precise approximation of pi.
* **Clear output:** The output is formatted nicely, making it easy to see the results for both approximations.


This revised code directly addresses the problem statement and calculates the approximation of pi using both 5 and 6 terms as requested.
