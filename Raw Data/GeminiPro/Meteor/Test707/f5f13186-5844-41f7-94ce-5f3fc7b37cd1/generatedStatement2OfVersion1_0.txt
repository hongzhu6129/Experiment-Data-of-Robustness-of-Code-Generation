Explanation:

1. **`public static String Column(int n)`:**
   - Takes an integer `n` (the column number) as input.
   - Uses a `StringBuilder` to build the column name efficiently.
   - The `while` loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `rem` stores the remainder when `n` is divided by 26.
     - If `rem` is 0, it means we need to append "Z" and adjust `n` accordingly (subtract 1 after dividing by 26 to handle the "Z" case correctly).
     - Otherwise, calculate the character by adding `rem - 1` to 'A' (ASCII value) and append it.
     - Divide `n` by 26 in each iteration.
   - Finally, reverse the `StringBuilder` (because we're building the name from right to left) and convert it to a `String`.

2. **`public static void main(String[] args)`:**
   - Contains test cases to demonstrate the `Column` function.
   - Prints the column names for different input values.



Key improvements over less efficient solutions:

- Uses `StringBuilder` for efficient string manipulation, avoiding repeated string concatenations which can be slow.
- Handles the "Z" cases (multiples of 26) correctly.
- Clearly explained logic with comments.
