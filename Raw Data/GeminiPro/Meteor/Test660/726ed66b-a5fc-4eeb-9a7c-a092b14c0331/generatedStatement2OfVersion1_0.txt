**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Custom Comparator Class:**  The `MyComparator` class implements the `Comparator<String>` interface.  This allows us to define our own sorting logic.

2. **Case-Insensitive Sorting:** The `compare` method now uses `s1.compareToIgnoreCase(s2)`  for case-insensitive sorting. You can modify this method to implement any other string comparison logic you require (e.g., sorting by length, sorting by the last character, etc.).

3. **TreeMap Instantiation with Comparator:**  The `TreeMap` is instantiated with an instance of `MyComparator`: `new TreeMap<>(new MyComparator())`.  This tells the `TreeMap` to use our custom comparator for sorting the keys.

4. **Clearer Example:** The `main` method demonstrates how to add elements and print the sorted `TreeMap`.

5. **Reverse Sorting:** The example also shows how to create a reverse sorted `TreeMap` using `new MyComparator().reversed()`. This is very convenient.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `TreeMapSortComparator.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac TreeMapSortComparator.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code: `java TreeMapSortComparator`


The output will show the sorted `TreeMap` according to the custom comparison logic you've defined in the `compare` method.
