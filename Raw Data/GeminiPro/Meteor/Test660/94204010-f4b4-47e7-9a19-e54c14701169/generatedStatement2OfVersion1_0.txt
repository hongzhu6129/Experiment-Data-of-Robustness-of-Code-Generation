**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Comparator Usage:**  The code now effectively demonstrates how to use a `Comparator` with a `TreeMap`.
   - **Lambda Expression for Descending Order:**  A lambda expression `(s1, s2) -> compare(s2, s1)` is used to create a `Comparator` that sorts in descending order.  Notice the reversed arguments in the lambda's call to `compare()`.
   - **Method Reference for Ascending Order:**  A method reference `TreeMapSort::compare` provides a concise way to use the `compare` method directly as a `Comparator` for ascending order.
2. **Clearer Examples:** The code includes separate `TreeMap` instances to illustrate both ascending and descending sorting. This makes it easier to understand the effect of the different `Comparator` implementations.
3. **Conciseness and Readability:** The code is more concise and readable, focusing on the core concepts of using a `Comparator` with `TreeMap`.
4. **Adherence to Method Signature Requirements:** The code strictly adheres to the requested `main` and `compare` method signatures.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `TreeMapSort.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac TreeMapSort.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java TreeMapSort`


This improved version provides a clear and concise demonstration of sorting a `TreeMap` using a custom `Comparator` implemented through both a lambda expression and a method reference, all while adhering to the specified method signatures.
