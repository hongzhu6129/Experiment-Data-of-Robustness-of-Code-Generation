**Test Cases:**

While this program doesn't take any input, we can still consider some aspects for testing:

1. **Correct Output:**  Verify that the output matches the expected format precisely, including capitalization, punctuation, and indentation (tabs).  Visually compare the program's output to the desired output.  This is the primary test.

2. **Platform Independence:** Test the code on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and Java versions to ensure consistent output.  Line endings (\r\n vs. \n) can sometimes vary, so check for that.

3. **Character Encoding:** While less likely an issue with this specific program, for more complex output involving special characters, ensure your output uses a consistent character encoding (e.g., UTF-8).  You might introduce a test that checks for the correct display of special characters if your rhyme were modified to include them.


**"Corner Cases" (In a Broader Sense):**

For this particular program, true corner cases are limited because there's no input to manipulate. However, thinking about related scenarios can be valuable:

* **Modified Rhyme:**  If the rhyme were to change (longer lines, different indentation), how easily could you adapt the `printTwinkleTwinkle()` method?  This tests the maintainability and flexibility of your code. Create test cases with different versions of the rhyme.

* **Internationalization:** If you needed to support different languages (with varying line lengths and characters), how would you handle that?  This tests the design for potential future requirements.  While not strictly a corner case for the original program, it's a valuable consideration.
