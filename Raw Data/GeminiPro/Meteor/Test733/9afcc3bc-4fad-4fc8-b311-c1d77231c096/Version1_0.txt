Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Explanation:**  Added comments to explain the logic of ternary search within the code.  Included an example demonstrating why ternary search requires a sorted (or unimodal in its true sense) array.
2. **Error Handling:**  Returns `-1` if the element is not found.
3. **Unimodal Example:** Included a separate `findMinIndexUnimodal` function and example to demonstrate how ternary search can be adapted to its more typical use case � finding the minimum or maximum of a *unimodal function* (represented here by a unimodal array). The core concept of dividing the search space is the same.  This clarifies that basic ternary search (as in the Wikipedia definition) is used for finding extrema, not for finding a specific value in a sorted array (though it can be adapted for that, as in the initial `ternary_search` method).
4. **Example demonstrating limitation:** The code includes an example with a descending array to highlight that basic ternary search requires a specific type of ordered input (ascending or unimodal) to work correctly.


This revised educational example is more comprehensive, demonstrates good coding practices, and explains the purpose and limitations of ternary search more effectively.
