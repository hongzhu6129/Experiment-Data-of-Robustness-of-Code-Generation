**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases including corner cases to test the program:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Output: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -70
   - Expected Output: 0 km

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0 
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km  (approximately the Earth's circumference / 2)

4. **Opposite sides of the Earth (Antipodes):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 110
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately the Earth's circumference / 2)


5. **Points near the Prime Meridian/International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Output:  A small distance (because these points are close despite being on opposite sides of the Date Line).

6. **Invalid Input (optional):**  You could add error handling to your Java code to handle inputs outside the valid range for latitude (-90 to +90) and longitude (-180 to +180).  Test with invalid latitude/longitude values to ensure your program handles them gracefully (e.g., prints an error message).

7. **Points at different longitudes but same latitude:**
    - lat1: 45
    - lon1: 0
    - lat2: 45
    - lon2: 180
    - Expected Output: ~12742 km (approximately the Earth's circumference * cos(45) / 2)



By testing these cases, you can be more confident that your distance calculation is working correctly across a range of scenarios, including edge cases and potential error conditions.  Remember to convert your input to radians within your program as the `Math.acos`, `Math.sin`, and `Math.cos` functions expect radian input.
