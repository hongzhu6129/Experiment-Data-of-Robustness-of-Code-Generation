**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering normal operations, zero handling, and large numbers:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (Positive Integers) | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 2 (Negative Integers) | -5 | -3 | -8 | -2 | 15 | 1.6666666666666667 | -2.0 |
| 3 (Mixed Signs) | 7 | -2 | 5 | 9 | -14 | -3.5 | 1.0 |
| 4 (Zero as num1) | 0 | 6 | 6 | -6 | 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 5 (Zero as num2) | 8 | 0 | 8 | 8 | 0 | Division by zero is not allowed | Division by zero is not allowed |  
| 6 (Decimal Numbers) | 2.5 | 1.2 | 3.7 | 1.3 | 3.0 | 2.0833333333333335 | 0.1 |
| 7 (Large Numbers) | 1000000 | 5000 | 1005000 | 995000 | 5000000000 | 200.0 | 0.0 |
| 8 (Integer Overflow Check �  May vary based on system) | Integer.MAX_VALUE | 1 |  Integer.MIN_VALUE | 2147483646 |  2147483647 | 2.147483647E9 | 1.0 |




**How to run the tests:**

1. **Manual Testing:** You can manually input these values into the program and verify the output against the expected results.

2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  A better approach is to create automated tests using a testing framework like JUnit.  This makes testing more robust and repeatable. Here's a basic example using JUnit:
