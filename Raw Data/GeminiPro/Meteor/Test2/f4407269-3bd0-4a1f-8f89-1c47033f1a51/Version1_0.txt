```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        double num1 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        double num2 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Sum: " + (num1 + num2));
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (num1 - num2));
        System.out.println("Product: " + (num1 * num2));

        if (num2 != 0) {  // Check for division by zero
            System.out.println("Quotient: " + (num1 / num2));
            System.out.println("Remainder: " + (num1 % num2));
        } else {
            System.out.println("Division by zero is not allowed.");
        }

        input.close(); // Close the scanner
    }
}
```


**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 3. Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2.0 | 0.0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 (Except Division) | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | "Division by zero" | "Division by zero" |
| 6. Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13.0 | 8.0 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0.0 |
| 7. Large Numbers | 1000000 | 1000 | 1001000 | 999000 | 1000000000 | 1000.0 | 0.0 |
| 8. Small Numbers | 0.001 | 0.002 | 0.003 | -0.001 | 0.000002 | 0.5 | 0.0 |



**How to run the tests:**

You can manually test these cases by inputting the values into the program. For more automated testing, consider using a testing framework like JUnit. Here's a simple example with JUnit:



```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class ArithmeticOperationsTest {

    @Test
    void testPositiveNumbers() {
        assertEquals(15, ArithmeticOperations.sum(10, 5));  // Example for sum; add more for other operations
        // ... similar assertions for other test cases
    }

    // ... more test methods for other test cases

    // You'll need to create static methods like sum(), subtract(), etc. in your ArithmeticOperations class for these tests to work
     public static double sum(double num1, double num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }


}
```


This JUnit example shows how to test the `sum` operation. You'd add similar `@Test` methods for the other operations (subtract, multiply, divide, remainder) and adapt the expected values according to the test case table.  Make sure you add the JUnit library to your project.  This more structured approach is better for larger projects.


This provides a comprehensive set of test cases and a basic framework for automated testing. Remember to adapt the JUnit example by creating the corresponding static methods in your `ArithmeticOperations` class.
