**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:**  The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that can occur during file reading.  This makes the code more robust. The program will exit gracefully (or you can add alternative handling) if the file is not found or there are other I/O issues.
2. **Clearer File Path:**  I've added a comment `// Replace with the actual path to your file` to highlight the importance of specifying the correct file path.
3. **List to Array Conversion (Optional):** The code efficiently reads the lines into an `ArrayList` first.  If you *need* an array specifically,  it then shows how to convert the `ArrayList` to a `String[]` using `lines.toArray(new String[0]);`.  If an `ArrayList` is sufficient (often it is), you can skip this conversion.
4. **Output:** The code includes a loop to print the stored lines (either from the `ArrayList` or the `String[]`), confirming that the data has been read and stored successfully.


**How to Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FileToArray.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac FileToArray.java`
3. **Run:**  `java FileToArray`

Make sure to replace `"path/to/your/textfile.txt"` with the actual path to your text file.


This improved version addresses the potential exception and provides a complete working example.
