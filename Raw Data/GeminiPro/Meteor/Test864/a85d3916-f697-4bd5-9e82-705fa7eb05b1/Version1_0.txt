```java
public class ApproximatePi {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double piApproximation1 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0/3.0) + (1.0/5.0) - (1.0/7.0) + (1.0/9.0) - (1.0/11.0)); // Corrected signs
        double piApproximation2 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0/3.0) + (1.0/5.0) - (1.0/7.0) + (1.0/9.0) - (1.0/11.0) + (1.0/13.0)); // Corrected signs

        System.out.println("Approximation 1: " + piApproximation1);
        System.out.println("Approximation 2: " + piApproximation2); 
    }
}
```


Key changes and explanations:

1. **Corrected Signs:** The original prompt had some incorrect signs in the series. The Leibniz formula for pi alternates signs:  1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...  The code is now corrected to reflect this.

2. **Use of 1.0:**  As requested, all integer values are explicitly written as floating-point values (e.g., `1.0` instead of `1`). This ensures that floating-point division is performed, giving a more accurate result.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly labels each approximation to make it easier to understand the results.


This revised code accurately calculates the two approximations of pi using the Leibniz formula.
