Key improvements:

* **Efficiency:**  Uses a two-pointer approach ( `left` and `right`) for in-place partitioning.  This avoids unnecessary swaps and improves performance.  It's generally more efficient than other methods like creating separate positive and negative arrays.
* **Correctness:** Handles edge cases (empty array, all positive, all negative) correctly.
* **Clarity:**  The `swap` function is now private (as requested) and the `main` method includes more comprehensive test cases.
* **Conciseness:** The code is more compact and easier to read.


The order of positive and negative numbers *within* their respective sections is not guaranteed to be maintained (and the prompt doesn't require it), but all negatives will be on the left and all positives/zeros on the right.
