If an assertion fails, you'll get an `AssertionError` with the specified message, which helps you debug the code. If all assertions pass, you'll see the "All test cases passed!" message.


**Key Corner Cases Covered:**

* **Zero (0):**  Decimal 0 should convert to octal 0.
* **One (1):**  Decimal 1 should convert to octal 1.
* **Maximum Integer Value (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`):**  Tests the conversion with the largest possible integer value.
* **7 (single digit less than 8)** Tests a decimal number which is valid for a single octal digit.



This improved version provides better code structure, efficiency, and thorough testing.
