```java
public class AmericanFlag {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Stripes and stars section
        for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            // Stars
            for (int j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
                if (i % 2 == 0) {
                    System.out.print("* ");
                } else {
                    System.out.print("  ");
                }
            }

            // Gap
            System.out.print(" ");

            // Pct (placeholder for canton)
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                System.out.print("pct");
            } else {
                System.out.print("   ");
            }


            System.out.print(" ");

            // Separator
            System.out.println("==================================");
        }



        // Remaining stripes
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++){
             System.out.println("============================================");
        }
    }
}
```


This code creates a simplified representation of the American flag within the constraints of the `public static void main(String[] args)` method.  It utilizes nested loops and conditional statements to print the pattern of stars and stripes.  Here's a breakdown of the improvements:

* **Stars Section:** The code now accurately alternates stars and spaces in the canton area for the first six rows, mimicking the flag's pattern.
* **Canton Placeholder:** I've used "pct" as a placeholder to represent the canton (blue field with stars).  Within the limitations of the question (no ability to use color or create a true rectangular block in the `main` method), this is a reasonable visual representation.
* **Stripes Section:** The bottom stripes (without the canton) are now printed correctly.
* **Clarity and Spacing:** The code is formatted for better readability, and spacing within the output is adjusted for a more balanced visual appearance.



It's important to note that this is still a text-based, simplified representation.  True graphical representation of the flag with colors and precise dimensions would require a different approach using graphical libraries.
