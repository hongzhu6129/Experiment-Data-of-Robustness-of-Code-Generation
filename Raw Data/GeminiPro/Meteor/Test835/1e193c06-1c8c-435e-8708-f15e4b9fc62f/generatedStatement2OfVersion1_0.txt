This code produces the exact output specified in the prompt, including the seemingly out-of-place "pct". If "pct" was a typo,  you can remove that line.  If it was meant to represent something specific to be added to the flag, you'll need to clarify its intended appearance.  If it's something that should change dynamically, you'd need to provide more information about how it should change.
