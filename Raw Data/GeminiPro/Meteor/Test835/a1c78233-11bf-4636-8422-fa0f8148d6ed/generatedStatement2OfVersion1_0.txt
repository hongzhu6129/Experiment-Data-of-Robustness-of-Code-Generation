**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Structure:** The code is organized into clear sections for the striped part and the solid red part, making it more readable.

2. **Loops:**  Nested loops are used effectively to print the rows and columns of stars and equal signs. The loop counters are adjusted to match the desired dimensions of the flag.

3. **"pct":** The "pct" string has been correctly included in the 7th row as specified in the problem prompt.

4. **Accuracy:** The code is revised to produce output that matches the provided example precisely, including the number of stars, equal signs, and overall layout.


This improved version provides a more accurate and readable representation of the desired output.  It's still a textual representation and doesn't use graphics, but within the constraints of the question (using only `main` and printing to the console), this is a close approximation.
