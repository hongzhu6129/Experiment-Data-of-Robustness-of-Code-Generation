Key improvements and explanations:

* **Uses `java.time`:**  The modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8) is used, replacing the older and less robust `Date` and `Calendar` classes.
* **`LocalDateTime` and `ZonedDateTime`:**  `LocalDateTime` is used for date and time without time zone information. `ZonedDateTime` is used when time zone is required.
* **`DateTimeFormatter`:** This class provides flexible formatting options.  Various patterns are demonstrated.
* **Clearer Formatting Patterns:**  The code uses explicit format patterns to match the requested output.
* **Handles "leibstandarte":** The non-standard "leibstandarte" has been removed from the format string, as it's not a valid date/time format specifier.
* **Millisecond and Zone Example:** Added an example to show how to include milliseconds and the time zone short name (SSSz).
* **Zone Offset Example:**  Added an example for HH:mm:ss, Z to show how to include the zone offset.
* **System Time Zone:** `ZoneId.systemDefault()` is used to get the system's current time zone.  You can specify a different zone if needed (e.g., `ZoneId.of("America/New_York")`).


This revised code addresses the prompt's requirements correctly and efficiently, using best practices for date and time handling in Java.
