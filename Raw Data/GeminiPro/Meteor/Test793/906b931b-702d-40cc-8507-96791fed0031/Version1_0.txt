```java
public class DivideTwoNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int numerator = 50;
        int denominator = 3;

        // Perform integer division
        int result = numerator / denominator;

        // Print the result to the console
        System.out.println(numerator + "/" + denominator + ": " + result);

        // For a more precise result (including the remainder), you could do the following:

        double doubleNumerator = 50.0; // Note the .0 to ensure floating-point division
        double doubleDenominator = 3.0;
        double doubleResult = doubleNumerator / doubleDenominator;
        System.out.println(doubleNumerator + "/" + doubleDenominator + ": " + doubleResult);


        /* Educational Explanation in the comments (for learning):
         *
         * 1. Integer Division:
         *    - When you divide two integers in Java, the result is also an integer.
         *    - Any remainder is discarded.  This is why 50 / 3 gives 16, not 16.666...
         *
         * 2. Floating-Point Division:
         *    - To get a more precise result with decimals, at least one of the numbers
         *      must be a floating-point type (double or float).
         *    - We can achieve this by adding ".0" to the integer literals or explicitly
         *      casting one of them to double:  (double)numerator / denominator
         *
         * 3. Printing the Result:
         *    - System.out.println() is used to display output on the console.
         *    - The + operator concatenates (joins) strings and the results of calculations.
