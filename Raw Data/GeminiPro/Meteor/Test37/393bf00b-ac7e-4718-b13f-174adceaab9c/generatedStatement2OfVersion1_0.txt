**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Input (n) | Expected Output | Reason/Notes                               |
|------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0         | 0             | All terms become zero                      |
| 1         | 123           | 1 + 11 + 111 = 123                        |
| 2         | 246           | 2 + 22 + 222 = 246                        |
| 5         | 615           | 5 + 55 + 555 = 615                        |
| 9         | 1107          | 9 + 99 + 999 = 1107                       |
| -1        | -123          | Handles negative numbers correctly         |
| -5        | -615          | Handles negative numbers correctly         |
| Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647)|  Long Overflow  | Corner case: Demonstrates potential integer overflow if not handled with `long`|


**Explanation of the Code and Test Cases:**

1. **Input:** The program takes an integer `n` as input using the `Scanner` class.

2. **Calculation:**
   - `nn` is calculated by multiplying `n` by 10 and adding `n` to it. (Effectively, it creates the number `nn` as a numerical value, not just a string concatenation).
   - `nnn` is calculated similarly by multiplying `nn` by 10 and adding `n`.
   - The sum `n + nn + nnn` is then computed and stored in the `result` variable.

3. **Output:** The program prints the calculated `result`.

4. **Data Type (long):**  Crucially, the variables `nn`, `nnn`, and `result` are declared as `long`. This is extremely important because if `n` is a large integer (e.g., close to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`), the intermediate calculations and the final result can easily exceed the maximum value that an `int` can hold, leading to integer overflow. Using `long` helps prevent this by providing a larger range.

5. **Test Cases:**  The provided test cases cover a good range of inputs:
   - Positive numbers
   - Zero
   - Negative numbers
   - A large number to demonstrate the potential integer overflow issue if `long` isn't used correctly.


**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You can either manually enter each input and check the output, or you can write a simple test program (using JUnit or a similar testing framework) to automate the testing process.  Automated testing is highly recommended, especially for more complex programs.
