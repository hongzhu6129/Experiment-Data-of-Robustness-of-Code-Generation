**Explanation and Improvement over simpler approaches:**

1. **Diophantine Number Definition:**  A Diophantine number is a number that can be expressed as the difference of two positive integer squares (x = a� - b�).

2. **Efficient Generation:** The code uses a nested loop structure to efficiently generate Diophantine numbers. The outer loop iterates through possible values of 'n' (essentially the smaller square, b�). The inner loop iterates through 'a' values (the larger square, a�).  We start `a` from `n+1` to ensure the difference is always positive.

3. **Avoiding Redundancy and Duplicates:**  This approach avoids generating duplicate Diophantine numbers and is more efficient than checking all possible pairs of squares.  It systematically generates the numbers in an increasing order.

4. **Stopping Condition:**  The `count` variable keeps track of how many Diophantine numbers have been found and displayed. The loops stop when `count` reaches 10.
