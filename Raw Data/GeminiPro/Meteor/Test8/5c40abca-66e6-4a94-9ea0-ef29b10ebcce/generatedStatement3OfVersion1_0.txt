In the example JUnit test code above, I show the normal and two edge cases, where calculateArea is a new function in your main `Rectangle` code that would actually do the calculation, separated from user input (this is needed for good test design).  You will need to add the other test cases, and create some new error-handling methods. Then your main `Rectangle` method can handle the user input and call these new methods for calculations and display the results or error messages, making your code more robust.  This separation of concerns (calculation vs. user interface) allows for good testing and organization.
