Key improvements:

* **Handles empty arrays:**  Added a check at the beginning to return 0 if the input array is empty, preventing potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueCount` is more descriptive than just `count`.
* **In-place Modification and Return Value:**  The function modifies the input array `nums` in place to contain the unique elements at the beginning, and it returns the new length (`uniqueCount`), which represents the number of unique elements.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes various test cases, including empty and single-element arrays, to demonstrate the correctness of the function.
* **Output Formatting:** The output now clearly shows both the updated length and the modified array containing only the unique elements.  The `Arrays.copyOfRange` method is used to prevent displaying the unmodified portion of the array.
