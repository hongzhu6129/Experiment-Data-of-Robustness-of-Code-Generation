This code demonstrates the `peek()` method's functionality:

1. **Creates a PriorityQueue:**  A `PriorityQueue` of `Integer` objects is created. PriorityQueues automatically order elements based on their natural ordering (for Integers, smallest to largest), or a provided `Comparator`.

2. **Adds elements:**  Elements are added to the PriorityQueue using `add()`.

3. **Retrieves the first element:** `peek()` is used to retrieve the smallest element (head) of the PriorityQueue *without removing it*.

4. **Handles empty PriorityQueue:** The code checks if the PriorityQueue is empty before accessing the result of `peek()`. If the queue is empty, `peek()` returns `null`.

5. **Demonstrates `poll()`:** The code also demonstrates `poll()`, which retrieves *and removes* the head of the queue, showing the difference between `peek()` and `poll()`.

6. **Shows `peek()` after `poll()`:**  This part further clarifies how `peek()` works after an element has been removed using `poll()`.

7. **Example with Empty Queue:** Shows how `peek()` behaves when called on an empty PriorityQueue, illustrating that it returns `null` in that case.
