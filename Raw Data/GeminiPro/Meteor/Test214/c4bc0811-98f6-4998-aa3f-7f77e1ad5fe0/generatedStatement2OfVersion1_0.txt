Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Null and Empty Arrays:** The `removeDuplicates` method now correctly handles cases where the input array is `null` or empty.  It returns 0 in these situations.

2. **Efficient In-Place Modification:**  The algorithm modifies the array in-place, which is more efficient than creating a new array. It uses a `uniqueIndex` to keep track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:**  The variable name `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `i` or `j`, making the code easier to understand.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes multiple test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the code with various input arrays, including empty and `null` arrays.

5. **Output formatting:** Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` and `Arrays.toString` for clear output of the unique elements in the modified array, avoiding printing elements beyond the new length. It also handles the `null` array case gracefully in the output.


This revised version is more robust, efficient, and easier to understand. It effectively removes duplicates from a sorted array and returns the new length, adhering strictly to the specified method signatures.
