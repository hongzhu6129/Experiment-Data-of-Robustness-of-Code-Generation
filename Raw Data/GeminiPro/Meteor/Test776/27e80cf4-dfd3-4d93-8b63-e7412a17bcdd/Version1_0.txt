```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Calculate and print the average of three numbers
        double num1 = 10; // Example numbers - you can change these
        double num2 = 20;
        double num3 = 30;
        double average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;
        System.out.println("The average is: " + average);


        // Calculate and print the area and perimeter of a rectangle
        double width = 5.5;
        double height = 8.5;
        double area = width * height;
        double perimeter = 2 * (width + height);
        System.out.println("Area of the rectangle: " + area);
        System.out.println("Perimeter of the rectangle: " + perimeter);

    }
}
```


This code combines both problems within a single `main` method:

1. **Average Calculation:**
   - It declares three `double` variables (`num1`, `num2`, `num3`) and initializes them with example values.  You can modify these to take input from the user if needed (using `Scanner` which would require modifying the method signature, or command line arguments by parsing `args`).
   - It calculates the average and stores it in the `average` variable.
   - It prints the average to the console.

2. **Rectangle Area and Perimeter:**
   - It declares `width` and `height` variables and initializes them with the given test data (5.5 and 8.5).
   - It calculates the area and perimeter using the standard formulas.
   - It prints the area and perimeter to the console.
