Key improvements:

- **Educational explanations:**  The code now includes printed explanations of how Roman numerals work, including the basic symbols and the subtractive principle. It also provides step-by-step explanations for specific examples (like MCMXCIV and IX).
- **Example usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `romanToInt` function with several examples and includes the expected output for easy verification.
- **Clearer code:**  Improved comments and formatting make the code easier to read and understand.
- **`explainConversion` function:**  This helper function is now used to provide specific explanations, keeping the `main` method more organized.  You can easily add explanations for other Roman numeral examples as needed.
