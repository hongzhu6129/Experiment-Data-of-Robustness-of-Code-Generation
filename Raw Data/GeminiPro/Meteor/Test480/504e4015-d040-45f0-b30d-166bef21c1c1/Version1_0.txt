```java
import java.time.ZoneId;
import java.util.Set;

public class TimeZones {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<String> allZones = ZoneId.getAvailableZoneIds();

        System.out.println("Available Time Zones (including UTC and GMT):");
        for (String zone : allZones) {
             // Explicitly check and print UTC and GMT variations 
            if (zone.equals("UTC") || zone.equals("GMT") || zone.startsWith("UTC") || zone.startsWith("GMT")) {
                System.out.println(zone);
            }
        }

          // Or, to print all including those that mention UTC or GMT in their names:
//        for (String zone : allZones) {
//            if (zone.contains("UTC") || zone.contains("GMT")) {
//                 System.out.println(zone);
//            }
//        }


    }
}
```


This improved version addresses a few key points:

* **Clarity and Readability:** The output now clearly indicates that the listed zones are those related to UTC and GMT.  
* **Explicit Checks:**  It directly checks for "UTC" and "GMT" and variations like "UTC+1".  This is more precise than simply checking if the zone ID contains the substrings "UTC" or "GMT".  If you *did* want to find *all* zone IDs with "UTC" or "GMT" in their names (even things like "America/Argentina/Ushuaia"), then the commented-out loop would be what you would want.
* **Efficiency (slightly):** Checking for prefixes using `startsWith()` can be slightly more efficient than using `contains()` in some cases.



This code will now specifically show the standard UTC and GMT zones and their offsets while avoiding unnecessary output or potentially confusing results.
