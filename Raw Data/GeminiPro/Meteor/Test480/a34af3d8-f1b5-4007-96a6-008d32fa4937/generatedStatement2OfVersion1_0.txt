**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Filtering for UTC/GMT:**  The code now efficiently filters for time zones that start with "Etc/GMT", "GMT", or "UTC".  This provides a more precise list of relevant time zones.

2. **`getDisplayName()` (Optional):**  I've added `tz.getDisplayName()` to show the longer, more human-readable name of the time zone along with its ID. This is optional but can make the output clearer.

3. **Alternative Using `getRawOffset()` (Commented out):**  I've included a commented-out section that demonstrates how to use `getRawOffset()` to filter for time zones with offsets that are exact multiples of one hour (as GMT/UTC time zones are). This approach might be useful in some cases but is generally less reliable than filtering by ID because some time zones might accidentally have a whole-hour offset but not be true GMT/UTC zones.

4. **Clarity and Comments:** The code now has better comments to explain the filtering logic.

**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `TimeZones.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it: `javac TimeZones.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code: `java TimeZones`


This improved version will give you a more accurate and user-friendly list of available UTC/GMT time zones.
