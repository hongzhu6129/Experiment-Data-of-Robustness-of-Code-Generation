```java
import java.time.ZoneId;
import java.time.ZonedDateTime;
import java.util.Set;

public class TimeZones {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<String> allZoneIds = ZoneId.getAvailableZoneIds();

        System.out.println("Available Time Zones (UTC/GMT and others):");

        for (String zoneId : allZoneIds) {
            if (zoneId.startsWith("UTC") || zoneId.startsWith("GMT") || zoneId.contains("Etc/")) { // Focus on UTC, GMT and Etc
                ZoneId zone = ZoneId.of(zoneId);
                ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.now(zone);
                System.out.println(zoneId + ": " + now.toString()); 
            }
        }
    }
}
```


This improved version focuses specifically on UTC, GMT, and Etc time zones (which are related to UTC/GMT offsets), providing a more concise and relevant output.  It also displays the current time in each zone, making it easier to understand the offsets.  Key improvements:

* **Filtering:**  Uses `startsWith("UTC")`, `startsWith("GMT")`, and `contains("Etc/")` to select the desired time zones.
* **Clearer Output:**  Prints the `zoneId` along with the current time in that zone using `ZonedDateTime`.
* **Etc/ Zone Handling:** Includes `Etc/` zones as they usually define special zones like UTC itself.


This makes the output much more manageable and focused on the time zones the user likely wants to see when asking about "UTC and GMT" time borders.
