```java
public class Staircase {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; // Example: Build staircase with 10 coins

        int rows = 0;
        int coinsUsed = 0;
        int currentRowCoins = 1;

        while (coinsUsed + currentRowCoins <= n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < currentRowCoins; i++) {
                System.out.print("$"); // Print a coin (you can use any symbol)
            }
            System.out.println(); // New line after each row

            coinsUsed += currentRowCoins;
            currentRowCoins++;
            rows++;
        }

        // Handle remaining coins (if any)
        if (coinsUsed < n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n - coinsUsed; i++) {
                System.out.print("$");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }

        System.out.println("Number of rows: " + rows); // Optional: Print the number of complete rows
    }
}
```


Here's how this code works:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n`:  Stores the total number of coins.
   - `rows`: Keeps track of the number of complete rows formed.
   - `coinsUsed`: Stores the number of coins already used in the staircase.
   - `currentRowCoins`: Stores the number of coins needed for the current row (starts at 1).

2. **Looping to Build Rows:**
   - The `while` loop continues as long as there are enough coins to form the next row (`coinsUsed + currentRowCoins <= n`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - An inner `for` loop prints `currentRowCoins` number of "$" symbols (representing coins) for the current row.
     - A newline is printed after each row.
     - `coinsUsed` is updated.
     - `currentRowCoins` is incremented to prepare for the next row.
     - `rows` is incremented to count the complete rows.

3. **Handling Remaining Coins:**
   - After the `while` loop, there might be some remaining coins (`coinsUsed < n`). 
   - An `if` statement handles this by printing the remaining coins on a new line.

4. **Output:**
   - The code prints the staircase shape.
   - It also optionally prints the number of complete rows formed.


**Example Output (n = 10):**

```

$$

Number of rows: 3
