### Test cases

**Corner cases:**

* Two empty strings
* Two strings with the same characters in different order
* Two strings with the same characters in different case

**Normal cases:**

* Two strings with different characters
* Two strings with the same characters in the same order
* Two strings with the same characters in different case

**Examples:**

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
|---|---|---|
| "" | "" | The two strings are lexicographically equal. |
| "a" | "b" | The first string is lexicographically less than the second string. |
| "A" | "a" | The two strings are lexicographically equal. |
| "ab" | "ba" | The two strings are lexicographically equal. |
| "Abc" | "abc" | The two strings are lexicographically equal. |
| "123" | "abc" | The first string is lexicographically less than the second string. |
