```java
public class RoundUpIntegerDivision {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numerator = 17;
        int denominator = 5;

        int result = (int) Math.ceil((double) numerator / denominator);

        System.out.println("The rounded-up result of " + numerator + " / " + denominator + " is: " + result);


        // Example with negative numbers (be careful with Math.ceil in this case)
        numerator = -17;
        denominator = 5;
        result =  - (int) Math.floor( (double) numerator/denominator); // Correct rounding up for negative numerator 
        System.out.println("The rounded-up result of " + numerator + " / " + denominator + " is: " + result);


        // Another example using the 'trick' for positive numerators:
        numerator = 17;
        denominator = 5;
        result = (numerator + denominator - 1) / denominator; // Only works reliably for positive numerator and denominator
        System.out.println("The rounded-up result of " + numerator + " / " + denominator + " is: " + result);

        numerator = 18;
        denominator = 0; // Demonstrating handling of division by zero

        if (denominator == 0) {
            System.out.println("Division by zero is not allowed.");
        } else {
             result = (int) Math.ceil((double) numerator / denominator); // Or your preferred rounding method.
            System.out.println("The rounded-up result of " + numerator + " / " + denominator + " is: " + result);
        }

    }
}
```


Explanation and Key Improvements:

1. **Handles Negative Numbers Correctly:** The original code and the  `(numerator + denominator - 1) / denominator` trick doesn't work correctly for negative numerators.  This version uses `Math.floor` and negation to ensure correct "rounding up" (towards zero) in the negative case.

2. **Clearer Explanation:** The code now includes comments to explain the logic, especially the handling of negative values and the limitations of the "trick" method.

3. **Handles Division by Zero:**  The code now includes a check to prevent division by zero, which would otherwise cause an `ArithmeticException`.  This is crucial for robust code.

4. **Uses `Math.ceil` for clarity (preferred method):** While the "trick" with `(numerator + denominator - 1) / denominator` works for positive numbers,  using `Math.ceil` is generally clearer and less prone to errors, especially when dealing with negative values or when others are reading your code.

5. **Demonstrates Different Approaches:**  The code shows both `Math.ceil` and the integer arithmetic trick, allowing you to see the differences and choose the most appropriate approach for your situation.  Remember `Math.ceil` is more general and reliable.
