```java
public class CubeChecker {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Input number (for testing purposes, we'll hardcode it.  
        // In a real application, you'd use a Scanner to get input from the user).
        int num = 8;  // Replace 8 with any number you want to test

        // Check if the number is a perfect cube
        if (isPerfectCube(num)) {
            System.out.println("Number is a cube."); // Changed from "honeycomb" to "cube"
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number is not a cube.");
        }
    }

    // Helper function to check if a number is a perfect cube
    private static boolean isPerfectCube(int num) {
        // Handle negative numbers (cubes of negative numbers are negative)
        if (num < 0) {
           return isPerfectCube(-num);  // Check the absolute value for negative inputs
        }


        // Efficiently find the cube root (integer part) using cbrt 
        int cubeRoot = (int) Math.cbrt(num);  // cbrt returns a double; we cast to int


        // Check if the cube of the integer cube root is equal to the original number
        return cubeRoot * cubeRoot * cubeRoot == num; 
    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`cbrt()` for Efficiency:** The most significant change is using `Math.cbrt(num)` to calculate the cube root directly.  This is much more efficient than looping or using `Math.pow()` with fractional exponents, especially for larger numbers.

2. **Integer Casting:** Because `cbrt()` returns a `double`, we cast the result to an `int` to get the integer part of the cube root. This is essential for correctly comparing the cube of the integer root with the original number.

3. **Handling Negative Numbers:** The code now correctly handles negative input values by checking the cube of the absolute value if the input is negative.  The cube of a negative number is negative, so this ensures the program works for all integer inputs.

4. **Clearer Output:**  The output message is changed from "honeycomb" (which seemed to be a typo) to the more accurate "cube".

5. **Helper Function:** The `isPerfectCube()` function is introduced to encapsulate the cube-checking logic, making the `main` method cleaner and more readable.  This is good programming practice.


How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CubeChecker.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac CubeChecker.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled program: `java CubeChecker`



You can change the value of `num` in the `main` method to test with different numbers.  If you want to take input from the user, you would replace the line `int num = 8;` with something like this:

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
int num = scanner.nextInt(); 
```


Remember to import the `java.util.Scanner` class at the top of your file if you use this input method.
