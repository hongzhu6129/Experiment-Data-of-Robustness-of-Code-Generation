* **Delta/Tolerance in Assertions:** The `assertEquals` assertions for floating-point values now use a `delta` or tolerance value (e.g., `0.000001` or `1e-30`). This is crucial because direct floating-point comparisons can be unreliable due to rounding errors.  The tolerance should be adjusted according to the expected precision of your calculations.
* **Clearer Output:** The `main` method now prints the radius, perimeter, and area with labels for better readability.
* **Best Practices:**  The code uses more descriptive variable names and follows standard Java naming conventions.


To run the tests:

1.  Make sure you have JUnit 5 set up in your project.
2.  Run the `CircleCalculationsTest` class as a JUnit test.  Your IDE will have options for this.  From the command line you could use a build tool (Maven, Gradle) or compile and run directly, for example:
