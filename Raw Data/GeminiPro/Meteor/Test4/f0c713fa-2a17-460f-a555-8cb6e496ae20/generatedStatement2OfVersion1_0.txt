**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Standard Case (Positive Radius):**
   - Input: radius = 7.5
   - Expected Output: 
     - Perimeter: Approximately 47.1238898
     - Area: Approximately 176.7145867

2. **Zero Radius:**
   - Input: radius = 0
   - Expected Output:
     - Perimeter: 0
     - Area: 0

3. **Negative Radius (Invalid Input):**
   - Input: radius = -5
   - Expected Output:  The program should ideally handle this gracefully.  You could print an error message like "Radius cannot be negative" or throw an exception. The calculations as they are will produce negative area (which is not physically meaningful) and a negative perimeter. This could be handled by an if statement to check if the radius is greater than or equal to zero.

4. **Very Large Radius:**
   - Input: radius = 1000000  (or a similarly large number)
   - Expected Output:  Verify that the calculations are still accurate with large numbers.  Be mindful of potential overflow issues if you were using `int` or `float` instead of `double`.

5. **Small Radius:**
   - Input: radius = 0.0001
   - Expected Output:  Verify that the calculations are accurate with very small numbers.

**How to Run Test Cases (Example without JUnit):**

You can create a separate `TestCircleCalculations` class (or incorporate it into your main class if you're not using a testing framework like JUnit):
