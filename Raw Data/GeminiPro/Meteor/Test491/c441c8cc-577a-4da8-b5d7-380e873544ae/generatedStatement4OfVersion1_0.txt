5. **Monthly Interest Rate Calculation:** The annual interest rate is correctly converted to a monthly interest rate in decimal form by dividing by 1200 (12 months * 100 to convert percentage to decimal).
6. **Output Formatting:** The `printf` method formats the output to two decimal places for currency representation.


How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FutureInvestmentValue.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using the Java compiler: `javac FutureInvestmentValue.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java FutureInvestmentValue`


The program will then prompt you to enter the investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years, and it will calculate and display the future value.
