Key improvements and explanations in this version:

* **JUnit Tests:**  The code now includes comprehensive JUnit tests, which are essential for verifying the correctness of the function.  The tests cover normal cases, edge cases (like zero divisor, start > end, negative numbers), and boundary conditions.
* **Clearer Argument Handling:** The `if (start > end)` condition now returns 0, which is often a more logical behavior than throwing an exception in this scenario.  You can change this to throw an exception if your requirements dictate so.
* **Exception for Zero Divisor:** An `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown if the divisor is zero, preventing division by zero errors.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The test cases now cover a much wider range of scenarios, including:
    * Normal cases
    * Start greater than end
    * Negative start and end
    * Zero divisor
    * Divisibility by one
    * Negative divisor
    * No divisible numbers
    * Start equals end (divisible and not divisible)
    * Large range 


This revised version is much more robust and demonstrates good coding practices with its inclusion of thorough testing.  Remember to add the JUnit library (JUnit 5 is recommended) to your project to run the tests.
