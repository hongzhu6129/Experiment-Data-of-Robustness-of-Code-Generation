Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles the `pct` argument:** The code now correctly includes the "pct" string in the last row of stars *if* it is provided as a command-line argument. This is done using `args.length > 0 && args[0].equals("pct")`.
* **Clearer formatting:**  Consistent spacing makes the code more readable.
* **More efficient output:** Uses `print` for elements within a line and `println` only at the end of each line, reducing the number of output operations.
* **Correct Number of `=` characters:** Ensures the correct number of equal signs are printed in each section to match the required output.



To run this code with the "pct" argument, compile it and then execute it from the command line like this:
