**Explanation:**

1. **Hardcoded Values:** The first part of the `main` method demonstrates the sum of two hardcoded integer values (74 and 36).  The result is stored in the `sum` variable and then printed to the console.

2. **Command-Line Arguments (Optional):** The second part shows how to make the program more flexible by accepting the two numbers as command-line arguments.

   - `args.length == 2`:  This checks if exactly two arguments have been provided.
   - `Integer.parseInt()`: This converts the string arguments (from the command line) into integer values.
   - `try-catch`: This handles potential `NumberFormatException` errors that could occur if the user provides non-numeric input.

**How to run with command-line arguments:**

1. **Compile:** `javac SumTwoNumbers.java`
2. **Run:** `java SumTwoNumbers 123 456` (Replace 123 and 456 with your desired numbers)


This improved version allows you to calculate the sum of any two integers you provide when running the program.  If you don't provide any command-line arguments, it defaults to calculating 74 + 36.
