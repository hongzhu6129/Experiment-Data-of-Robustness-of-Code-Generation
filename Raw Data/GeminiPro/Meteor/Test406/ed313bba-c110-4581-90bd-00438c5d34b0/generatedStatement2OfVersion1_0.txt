Key improvements:

* **Regular Expressions:** Uses `java.util.regex` for efficient and flexible number extraction.  The `\\d+` pattern matches one or more consecutive digits.
* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the string contains a number that's too large to be parsed as an `int`. This prevents the program from crashing.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Uses more descriptive variable names (e.g., `sum`, `pattern`, `matcher`).
* **More Comprehensive Examples:** Includes a variety of test cases in `main` to demonstrate the functionality.  Now includes examples with single-digit numbers and a very large number to illustrate the error handling.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain key parts of the code.


This revised code is more robust, efficient, and easier to understand.  It handles a wider range of input strings and provides better error handling.
