Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer output:**  The output now explicitly states whether a security manager exists or not.  For environment variables, it specifies the variable name and its value or indicates if the variable isn't found.
* **Error Handling for Environment Variables:**  The code now checks if the environment variables are `null` before attempting to print them. This prevents `NullPointerExceptions` if the variables aren't defined.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility for TEMP/TMP and USER/USERNAME:** It accounts for the fact that `TEMP` might be `TMP` and `USERNAME` might be `USER` on different operating systems, providing a more robust way to fetch these common environment variables.  It checks both forms.
