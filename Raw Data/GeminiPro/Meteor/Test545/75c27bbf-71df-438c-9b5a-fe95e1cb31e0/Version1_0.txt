**Explanation:**

1. **Import necessary classes:**
   - `java.io.File`: Represents a file or directory.
   - `java.io.IOException`: Handles input/output exceptions.
   - `java.nio.file.Files`: Provides utility methods for file operations.


2. **`main` method:**
   - **File object:** Creates a `File` object representing the file you want to read. Replace `"path/to/your/file.txt"` with the actual path to your file.
   - **`Files.readAllBytes()`:** This is the key method. It reads all bytes from the specified file and returns them as a byte array.  This is the most concise way to read a file into a byte array in Java.
   - **Error handling:** The `try...catch` block handles potential `IOExceptions` that might occur if the file doesn't exist, you don't have permission to read it, etc.
   - **Printing the byte array (optional):** The loop demonstrates how you can access and process the elements of the byte array.  You can remove this if you don't need to print the bytes.


**How to use:**

1. **Create a file:** Create a text file (or any file type) that you want to read.  Let's say you name it "my_file.txt" and place it in a directory called "my_data".
2. **Update the file path:** In the code, replace `"path/to/your/file.txt"` with the correct path.  For example, if your file is in a directory named "my_data" in your project folder, the path would be `"my_data/my_file.txt"`. You might need an absolute path if your file is not directly in the project structure.
3. **Compile and run:** Compile the Java code and run it. The byte array representation of the file's contents will be printed to the console (if you kept the printing part of the code).  You can then use the `fileContent` byte array for any further processing you need.
