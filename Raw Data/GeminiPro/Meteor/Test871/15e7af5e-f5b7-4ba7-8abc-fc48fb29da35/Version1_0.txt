```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileSizeChecker {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] filePaths = { "/home/students/abc.txt", "/home/students/test.txt" }; // Replace with actual paths

        for (String filePath : filePaths) {
            File file = new File(filePath);

            if (file.exists()) {
                long fileSizeInBytes = file.length();
                System.out.println(filePath + " : " + fileSizeInBytes + " bytes");
            } else {
                System.out.println(filePath + " : File not found"); 
            }
        }
    }
}
```


**Explanation and improvements:**

1. **Handles file not found:** The original solution assumed the files always exist. This improved version checks `file.exists()` and prints a message if the file isn't found. This is crucial for robust file handling.
2. **Clearer output:** The output now includes "File not found" for missing files, making it more user-friendly.
3. **Uses an array:**  Instead of hardcoding file paths directly into the `File` constructors, the code uses a `String` array to store the file paths. This makes it easier to manage multiple files and avoids repetitive code.
4. **Correct file size:** The `file.length()` method accurately returns the file size in bytes.


**To run this code:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FileSizeChecker.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac FileSizeChecker.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code: `java FileSizeChecker`

Remember to replace `/home/students/abc.txt` and `/home/students/test.txt` with the actual paths to the files you want to check.  If you're running this on Windows, use Windows-style paths (e.g., `C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\abc.txt`).



If you don't want to change the paths in the code every time, you can pass them as command-line arguments:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileSizeChecker {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length == 0) {
            System.out.println("Please provide file paths as command-line arguments.");
            return;
        }

        for (String filePath : args) {
            File file = new File(filePath);
            // ... (rest of the code is the same as before)
        }
    }
}
```

Then you would run it like this:

```bash
java FileSizeChecker /path/to/file1.txt /path/to/file2.txt etc. 
```
