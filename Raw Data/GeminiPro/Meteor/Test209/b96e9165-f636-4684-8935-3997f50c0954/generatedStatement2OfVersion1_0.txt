Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly adheres to the provided method signatures `public int maxDepth(Node node)` and `public static void main(String[] args)`.
* **Node Class:**  The `Node` class is explicitly defined, making the code self-contained and easier to understand.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method now includes multiple test cases:
    * A balanced tree.
    * A skewed tree (to ensure it handles linked-list like structures correctly).
    * An empty tree (important edge case).
* **Improved Comments:**  Comments are added to explain the logic and the different test cases.
* **Conciseness and Readability:** The code is formatted for better readability.





This improved version is robust, easy to understand, and demonstrates the correct implementation of finding the maximum depth of a binary tree using recursion in Java.
