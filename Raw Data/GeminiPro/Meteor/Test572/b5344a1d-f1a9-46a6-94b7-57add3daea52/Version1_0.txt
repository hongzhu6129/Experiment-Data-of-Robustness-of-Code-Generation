    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an ArrayList with an initial capacity
        ArrayList<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>(20);

        // Add some elements
        fruits.add("Apple");
        fruits.add("Banana");
        fruits.add("Orange");
        fruits.add("Grape");

        // Print initial capacity and size
        System.out.println("Initial Capacity: " + fruits.size());
        System.out.println("Initial Size: " + fruits.size());


        // Trim the capacity to the current size
        fruits.trimToSize();


        // Print capacity and size after trimming
        System.out.println("Capacity after trimToSize(): " + fruits.size()); // Note: There's no direct way to get capacity in Java ArrayList after Java 7. This will show the size, which will equal the capacity after trimToSize().
        System.out.println("Size after trimToSize(): " + fruits.size());


         //Adding more elements after trimming
        fruits.add("Mango");
        fruits.add("Pineapple");


        System.out.println("Capacity after adding more elements : " + fruits.size()); //size reflects the new, increased capacity as it's dynamically grown.
        System.out.println("Size after adding more elements: " + fruits.size());


    }
}
```


**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Output:**  The code now explicitly prints the size and *effective* capacity both before and after `trimToSize()`. Since Java 7, there isn't a direct way to get capacity. We use the size as a proxy after `trimToSize()` as it will be equal to the capacity immediately after trimming. The output clearly demonstrates the change in size/capacity when more elements are added after trimming.

2. **Illustrative Example:** Adding more elements *after* trimming shows how the ArrayList dynamically grows its capacity again as needed, highlighting the purpose and effect of `trimToSize()`.

3. **Comments:** Added comments to make the code more understandable and explain the logic, especially regarding the handling of capacity.

4. **Correct Usage of `trimToSize()`:** The code now correctly uses `trimToSize()` at the relevant point in the program, after the initial elements are added but before more elements are added to show its impact.


**How `trimToSize()` Works:**

The `trimToSize()` method in `ArrayList` reduces the capacity of the `ArrayList` to its current size.  This means that if you have an `ArrayList` with a large initial capacity but only a few elements, `trimToSize()` will free up the unused memory.  This can be useful for memory optimization if you know you won't be adding many more elements to the list.  However, keep in mind that if you add more elements beyond the trimmed size, the `ArrayList` will have to resize its underlying array again, which can be a relatively expensive operation. Therefore use it judiciously when memory optimization is critical and the list size is relatively static.
