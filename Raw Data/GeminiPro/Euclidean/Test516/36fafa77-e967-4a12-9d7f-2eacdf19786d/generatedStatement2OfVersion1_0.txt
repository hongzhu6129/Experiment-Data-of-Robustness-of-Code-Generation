Key improvements and explanations:

* **HashSet for Cycle Detection:**  The `HashSet` called `seen` efficiently tracks numbers encountered during the process. This is crucial to detect cycles (which indicate an unhappy number) and prevent infinite loops.
* **Clearer Helper Function:** The `sumOfSquaresOfDigits` function is extracted to improve code readability and organization.  It calculates the sum of the squares of a number's digits.
* **Concise Return:** The `isHappy_number` function returns `true` if the number eventually becomes 1, and `false` otherwise (if a cycle is detected).
* **Meaningful Main Method:**  The `main` method now demonstrates the function's usage with clear examples, including cases from the prompt's original intent.


This improved version directly addresses the problem description, handles cycle detection effectively, and provides a well-structured, readable solution.
