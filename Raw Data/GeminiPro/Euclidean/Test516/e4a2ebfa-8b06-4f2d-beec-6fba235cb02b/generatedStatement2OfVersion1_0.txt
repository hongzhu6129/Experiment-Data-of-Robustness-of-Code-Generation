**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **HashSet for Cycle Detection:** The `isHappy_number` function now uses a `HashSet` called `seen` to keep track of numbers encountered during the process. This efficiently detects cycles. If a number is encountered again, it means the sequence has entered a loop, and the number is not happy.

2. **Clearer Loop Condition:** The `while` loop condition is simplified to `n != 1 && !seen.contains(n)`.  This makes it more readable.

3. **Digit Sum Calculation:** The inner `while` loop calculates the sum of the squares of digits correctly.

4. **Return Boolean:** The function returns a `boolean` value (true if happy, false if not) as required by the prompt.

5. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `isHappy_number` function with a couple of examples.  I've added several test cases including ones explicitly mentioned in comments on previous responses.
