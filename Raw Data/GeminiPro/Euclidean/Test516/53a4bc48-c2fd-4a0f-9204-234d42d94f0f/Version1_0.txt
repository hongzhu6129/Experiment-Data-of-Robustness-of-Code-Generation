Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

1. **HashSet for Cycle Detection:** The code uses a `HashSet` called `seen` to efficiently keep track of numbers encountered during the process.  This is crucial for detecting cycles and preventing infinite loops, which is the defining characteristic of unhappy numbers.

2. **Clearer Loop Condition:** The `while` loop condition `n != 1 && !seen.contains(n)` combines the two termination conditions: reaching 1 (happy number) or encountering a cycle (unhappy number).

3. **Concise Sum Calculation:** The inner `while` loop calculates the sum of the squares of digits efficiently.

4. **Return Boolean Result:** The function returns `true` if the number is happy and `false` otherwise, directly answering the question.

5. **Illustrative Main Method:** The `main` method provides examples to demonstrate how to use the `isHappy_number` function and shows both happy and unhappy number cases.  It now also includes the test cases suggested within the prompt's examples (7 and 2).



This improved version is more robust, efficient, and adheres to best practices for happy number determination. It also addresses the specific requirements of using only the provided method signatures.
