        // Additional tests

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **HashSet for Cycle Detection:** The `isHappy_number` function uses a `HashSet` called `seen` to keep track of numbers encountered during the process.  This is crucial for detecting cycles. If a number is already in `seen`, it means we're in a cycle, and the number is not happy.

2. **Clearer While Loop Condition:** The `while` loop continues as long as `n` is not equal to 1 AND `n` has not been seen before.  This concisely combines the two termination conditions.

3. **Digit Extraction and Sum Calculation:**  The inner `while` loop efficiently extracts digits and calculates the sum of squares.

4. **Return Condition:** The function returns `true` if `n` eventually becomes 1, and `false` otherwise (meaning it's trapped in a cycle).

5. **Main Method with Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `isHappy_number` function with sample inputs.  I've included tests for both happy and unhappy numbers.  You can uncomment the additional test cases for more thorough testing.


This improved version addresses potential infinite loops and provides a more robust and understandable solution.
