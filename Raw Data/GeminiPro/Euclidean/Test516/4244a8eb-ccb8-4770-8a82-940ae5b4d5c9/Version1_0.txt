        // More test cases (optional)

        System.out.println(1 + " is a happy number: " + isHappy_number(1)); //true

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **HashSet for Cycle Detection:** The `isHappy_number` method now uses a `HashSet` called `seen` to keep track of numbers encountered during the process. This efficiently detects cycles, preventing infinite loops for unhappy numbers.  If a number is already in `seen`, we know we're in a cycle and the number is not happy.

2. **Clearer Loop Condition:** The `while` loop condition is simplified to `n != 1 && !seen.contains(n)`.  This makes the logic more readable.

3. **Helper Function:** The `sumOfSquaresOfDigits` function is extracted to improve code organization and readability.  It calculates the sum of squares of a number's digits.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes multiple test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior with both happy and unhappy numbers, including edge cases like 1 and single-digit numbers.

5. **Comments and Explanations:**  Comments are added to clarify the code's logic and purpose.


This revised version is more efficient, robust, and easier to understand, addressing the potential infinite loop issue and adhering to best practices for code structure and clarity.
