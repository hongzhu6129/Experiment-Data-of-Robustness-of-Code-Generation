Key improvements and explanations in the test cases:

* **JUnit 5:** Uses the modern JUnit 5 library (`org.junit.jupiter.api`).
* **Focus on Format:** Since we can't easily control system time, the primary test verifies the output string's format using a regular expression.
* **Reasonable Time Difference:** A more practical test checks if the returned time falls within a small window around the actual execution time.  This is a more realistic way to test time-dependent functions.
* **Corner Cases:** Includes tests around leap years and year changes to ensure the date-time formatting handles these transitions correctly. These demonstrate how to verify the behavior with specific dates.
* **Hypothetical Time Setting (Commented out):** Shows how you *might* test if you could control the system time (e.g., using a mocking library), but emphasizes that this isn't typically practical.




This revised answer provides more robust and practical testing strategies for a time-dependent function. Remember to add the JUnit 5 dependency to your project if you haven't already.
