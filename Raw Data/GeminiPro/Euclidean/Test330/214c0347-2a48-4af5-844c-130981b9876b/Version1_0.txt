        String shape3 = "  * \n *** \n*****"; // Different leading whitespace
        String shape4 = " * * \n *** \n*****"; // Different characters
        String shape5 = "  *  \n *** \n *****"; // Different trailing whitespace


        System.out.println("Shape 1 and Shape 2 are the same: " + compareShapes(shape1, shape2));
        System.out.println("Shape 1 and Shape 3 are the same: " + compareShapes(shape1, shape3));
        System.out.println("Shape 1 and Shape 4 are the same: " + compareShapes(shape1, shape4));

    }


    public static boolean compareShapes(String shape1, String shape2) {
        // Normalize the strings to handle potential whitespace differences
        String normalizedShape1 = normalizeShape(shape1);
        String normalizedShape2 = normalizeShape(shape2);

        return normalizedShape1.equals(normalizedShape2);

    }


    private static String normalizeShape(String shape) {
        // 1. Split into lines
        String[] lines = shape.split("\n");

        // 2. Trim each line
        for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
            lines[i] = lines[i].trim();
        }

        // 3. Rebuild the string
        return String.join("\n", lines);

    }



}
```


Here's how the code works:

1. **`main` Method:** Sets up example string shapes and calls `compareShapes` to test them, printing the results.

2. **`compareShapes` Method:** Takes two strings as input.
   - Calls `normalizeShape` on both input strings to handle whitespace variations.
   - Uses `equals` for a direct string comparison after normalization.

3. **`normalizeShape` Method:** This is key to handling whitespace differences.
   - **Splits** the input string into lines using `\n` as the delimiter.
   - **Trims** each line, removing leading and trailing whitespace.
   - **Rebuilds** the string from the trimmed lines, joining them back with `\n`.

This normalization ensures that only the essential characters and their arrangement within each line are compared, ignoring extraneous whitespace that might lead to false negatives.
