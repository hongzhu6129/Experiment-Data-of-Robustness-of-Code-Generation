Here's how the code works:

1. **`main` Method:** Sets up example string shapes and calls `compareShapes` to test them, printing the results.

2. **`compareShapes` Method:** Takes two strings as input.
   - Calls `normalizeShape` on both input strings to handle whitespace variations.
   - Uses `equals` for a direct string comparison after normalization.

3. **`normalizeShape` Method:** This is key to handling whitespace differences.
   - **Splits** the input string into lines using `\n` as the delimiter.
   - **Trims** each line, removing leading and trailing whitespace.
   - **Rebuilds** the string from the trimmed lines, joining them back with `\n`.

This normalization ensures that only the essential characters and their arrangement within each line are compared, ignoring extraneous whitespace that might lead to false negatives.
