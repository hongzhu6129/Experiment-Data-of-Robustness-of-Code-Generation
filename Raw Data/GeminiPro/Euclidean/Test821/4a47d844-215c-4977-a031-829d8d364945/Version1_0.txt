```java
public class CheckJavaInstallation {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Java Version: " + System.getProperty("java.version"));
        System.out.println("Java Runtime Version: " + System.getProperty("java.runtime.version"));
        System.out.println("Java Home: " + System.getProperty("java.home"));
        System.out.println("Java Vendor: " + System.getProperty("java.vendor"));
        System.out.println("Java Vendor URL: " + System.getProperty("java.vendor.url"));
        System.out.println("Java Class Path: " + System.getProperty("java.class.path"));

        // More robust check (checks if java command is available in the system path)
        try {
            Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("java -version");
            int exitCode = p.waitFor();
            if (exitCode == 0) {
                System.out.println("\nJava is installed and accessible in the system path.");
            } else {
                System.err.println("\nJava might not be installed correctly or accessible in the system path.  Exit code: " + exitCode); // Added error stream for clearer output
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("\nError checking Java installation: " + e.getMessage()); // Added error stream and more informative error message
        }
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Output:** The code now uses `System.out.println` for regular output and `System.err.println` for error messages.  This makes it easier to distinguish between successful information retrieval and potential problems.
2. **Robust Check using `java -version`:**  Simply printing system properties doesn't guarantee that Java is *actually* runnable from the command line. The added `try-catch` block attempts to execute `java -version`.  This is a much more reliable way to verify that Java is properly installed and configured in the environment's `PATH`.
3. **Error Handling:**  The `try-catch` block handles potential exceptions during the execution of `java -version`.  It now provides a more informative error message if the check fails.
4. **Exit Code Check:** The code checks the exit code of the `java -version` process.  An exit code of 0 typically means success, while a non-zero exit code indicates an error. This provides additional information about the potential issue.




This revised version is much more comprehensive and robust than simply printing system properties, giving you a more accurate assessment of whether Java is properly installed and readily available for use on your system.
