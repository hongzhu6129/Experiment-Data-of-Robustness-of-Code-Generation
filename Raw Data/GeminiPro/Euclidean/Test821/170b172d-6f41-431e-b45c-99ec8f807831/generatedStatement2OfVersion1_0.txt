**Explanation:**

The fact that this code compiles and runs using a Java compiler and JVM is proof that Java is installed.  The code then uses `System.getProperty()` to retrieve and print various system properties related to the Java installation, providing further details about the installed Java version and environment.  If Java wasn't installed, the code wouldn't compile or run in the first place.
