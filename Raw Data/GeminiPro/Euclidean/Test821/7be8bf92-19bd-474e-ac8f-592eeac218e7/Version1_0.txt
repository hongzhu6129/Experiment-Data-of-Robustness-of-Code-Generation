```java
public class CheckJavaInstallation {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Java is installed on your computer.");
        System.out.println("Java Version: " + System.getProperty("java.version"));
        System.out.println("Java Runtime Version: " + System.getProperty("java.runtime.version"));
        System.out.println("Java Home: " + System.getProperty("java.home"));
        System.out.println("Java Vendor: " + System.getProperty("java.vendor"));
        System.out.println("Java Vendor URL: " + System.getProperty("java.vendor.url"));
        System.out.println("Java Class Path: " + System.getProperty("java.class.path")); 
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided information indicates that Java is already installed. The code simply confirms this and prints out relevant Java environment details using `System.getProperty()`.

Since the question specifically asks to "check whether Java is *replace*" and the provided info shows a valid installation,  I've interpreted the prompt as a request to confirm the presence of Java and display its version and related information. If the intention was to check for a *specific* Java version or feature, the question would need to be more explicit.


**To compile and run this code:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CheckJavaInstallation.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type: `javac CheckJavaInstallation.java`
3. **Run:**  Type: `java CheckJavaInstallation`


This will print the confirmation message and the Java environment details to the console. If Java isn't installed or configured correctly, you'll likely get an error during compilation or runtime.
