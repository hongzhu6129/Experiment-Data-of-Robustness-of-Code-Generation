**Explanation:**

The provided information indicates that Java is already installed. The code simply confirms this and prints out relevant Java environment details using `System.getProperty()`.

Since the question specifically asks to "check whether Java is *replace*" and the provided info shows a valid installation,  I've interpreted the prompt as a request to confirm the presence of Java and display its version and related information. If the intention was to check for a *specific* Java version or feature, the question would need to be more explicit.


**To compile and run this code:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CheckJavaInstallation.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type: `javac CheckJavaInstallation.java`
3. **Run:**  Type: `java CheckJavaInstallation`


This will print the confirmation message and the Java environment details to the console. If Java isn't installed or configured correctly, you'll likely get an error during compilation or runtime.
