**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Input and Validation:** The code now takes input from the user using a `Scanner`. It also swaps the years if `year1` is greater than `year2` to ensure correct calculation.  You could add further input validation (e.g., checking for valid year ranges) if needed.

2. **Looping for Calculation:**  The code iterates from `year1` (inclusive) up to but not including `year2` (exclusive) using a `for` loop. This calculates the total number of days in the years between the given years.

3. **Clear Method Signatures:** The code uses the required method signatures `main()`, `number_of_days()`, and `is_Leap_Year()` precisely as specified.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DaysBetweenYears.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using the command:  `javac DaysBetweenYears.java`
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program using: `java DaysBetweenYears`


Now, the program will prompt you to enter the two years, and it will output the total number of days between those years (exclusive of the end year).
