        System.out.print("Enter the starting year: ");
        int startYear = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the ending year: ");
        int endYear = scanner.nextInt();

        if (startYear > endYear) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input: Starting year must be less than or equal to ending year.");
            return;
        }

        int totalDays = 0;
        for (int year = startYear; year < endYear; year++) {
            totalDays += number_of_days(year);
        }

        System.out.println("The total number of days between " + startYear + " and " + endYear + " is: " + totalDays);
        scanner.close();

    }

    public static int number_of_days(int year) {
        if (is_Leap_Year(year)) {
            return 366;
        } else {
            return 365;
        }
    }

    public static boolean is_Leap_Year(int year) {
        return (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0);
    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

* **Input Validation:** The code now checks if `startYear` is greater than `endYear`. If it is, it prints an error message and exits gracefully, preventing unexpected behavior.
* **Clearer Prompts:**  User prompts are more descriptive, making it easier to understand what input is expected.
* **Inclusive Calculation (up to endYear - 1):** The loop now iterates up to `endYear -1` (exclusive of the end year) to correctly calculate the number of days *between* the start and end years.  If you intend to include the full end year as well, change the loop to `year <= endYear`.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` after it's no longer needed, which is good practice for preventing resource leaks.
* **Method Signatures Followed:** The code adheres strictly to the specified method signatures: `main`, `number_of_days`, and `is_Leap_Year`.


**Example Usage:**

```
Enter the starting year: 2000
Enter the ending year: 2004
The total number of days between 2000 and 2004 is: 1461 
``` (2000 is a leap year, adding 366, followed by three regular years adding 3 x 365).
