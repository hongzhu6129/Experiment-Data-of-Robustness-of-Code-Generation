**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Year Order:**  The code now correctly calculates the difference regardless of whether `year1` is greater or less than `year2`. If `year2` is smaller, it calculates the difference and then negates the result to indicate that `year2` is earlier.  It also handles the case where the years are the same (zero days).

2. **Clarity and Readability:** Variable names and comments are improved to make the code easier to understand.

3. **Error Handling (Optional):** You could add input validation to ensure the user enters valid year values (e.g., positive integers).


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.java` file (e.g., `DaysBetweenYears.java`).
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using the Java compiler:
   ```bash
   javac DaysBetweenYears.java
   ```
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code:
   ```bash
   java DaysBetweenYears 
   ```
   The program will prompt you to enter the two years.


This improved version provides a more robust and user-friendly solution to the problem.
