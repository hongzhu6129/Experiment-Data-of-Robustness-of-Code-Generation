Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Handles Null and Empty Input:** The `reverseEachWordInString` method now checks for `null` or empty input strings and prints an empty string in those cases, preventing `NullPointerException` or unnecessary processing.

2. **Uses `split("\\s+")`:** This is a more robust way to split the string into words.  `\\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters, so it correctly handles multiple spaces between words.

3. **`StringBuilder` for Efficiency:** Using `StringBuilder` is generally more efficient than string concatenation with `+` within a loop.

4. **`trim()` for Clean Output:** The `trim()` method removes leading and trailing spaces from the final reversed string, providing cleaner output.

5. **Clearer Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates several different example usages of the `reverseEachWordInString` method, including handling null and empty input strings, as well as strings with leading and trailing spaces.

6. **Object-Oriented Approach:** The code uses a class (`ReverseWordsInString`) and a method (`reverseEachWordInString`), making it more organized and reusable.
