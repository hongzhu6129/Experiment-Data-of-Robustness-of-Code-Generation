This code demonstrates two ways to get the length of a string:

1. **Using a hardcoded string:** The variable `str` is initialized with "example string", and its length is obtained using `str.length()`.

2. **Using command-line arguments:**  The `args` array in `main` holds any command-line arguments passed to the program. If any arguments are provided (checked using `args.length > 0`), the first argument (`args[0]`) is treated as a string, and its length is calculated and printed.  To run with command-line arguments, you would compile the code and then execute it from the command line like this: `java StringLength "my string"` (replace `"my string"` with the string you want to test).


This revised answer adheres to the prompt's requirement of using only the `public static void main(String[] args)` method signature.
