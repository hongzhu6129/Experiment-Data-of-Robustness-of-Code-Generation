   This tells the `TreeMap` to use your custom comparator to order the keys.

4. **Example Tekelec Logic (Replace this!):**  The current `compare` method provides a placeholder example: sorting even digits before odd digits.  You *must* replace this with the real Tekelec sorting rules.  If you can provide more details on what "Tekelec sorting" means, I can give you a more precise implementation of the `compare` method.

5. **Clearer Example in main():** The `main` method now provides a clearer demonstration of how to add elements and then print the sorted `TreeMap`.



**How to Use:**

1. **Replace Placeholder Logic:** Modify the `compare` method in `TekelecComparator` to implement your specific Tekelec sorting algorithm.
2. **Add Your Data:** Add your key-value pairs to the `tekelecMap` in the `main` method.
3. **Run the Code:** The `TreeMap` will automatically sort the keys according to your Tekelec logic.


If you can provide more specific details on how Tekelec sorting works, I can refine the `compare` method to match the exact requirements.
