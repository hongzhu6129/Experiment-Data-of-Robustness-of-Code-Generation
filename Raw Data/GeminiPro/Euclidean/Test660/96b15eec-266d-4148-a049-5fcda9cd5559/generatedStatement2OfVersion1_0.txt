**Explanation:**

1. **TreeMap with Comparator:**
   - We create a `TreeMap` and pass an instance of our custom `MyComparator` to its constructor. This tells the `TreeMap` to use our specific logic for sorting keys.

2. **Custom Comparator (MyComparator):**
   - The `MyComparator` class implements the `Comparator<String>` interface.
   - The crucial method is `compare(String s1, String s2)`.  It defines how two strings (`s1` and `s2`) should be compared to determine their order.
   - In this example, `s2.compareTo(s1)` sorts the keys in reverse alphabetical order. If you want standard alphabetical order, use `s1.compareTo(s2)`.

3. **Adding Elements:**
   - We add key-value pairs to the `TreeMap` using the `put()` method.

4. **Printing:**
   - When we print the `TreeMap`, the keys will be displayed in the sorted order determined by the `MyComparator`.


**Example Output (with reverse alphabetical order):**
