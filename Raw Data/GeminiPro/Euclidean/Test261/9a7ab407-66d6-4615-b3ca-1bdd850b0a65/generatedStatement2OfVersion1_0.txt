Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles Edge Cases:**  Correctly handles empty arrays and null input.
- **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueIndex` makes the code easier to follow.
- **Concise Logic:**  Simplified the conditional within the loop.
- **Comprehensive `main` Method:** Includes multiple test cases demonstrating the function's behavior with different inputs (including edge cases).
- **Output Formatting:**  Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` and `Arrays.toString` in the `main` method to clearly display the updated portion of the array after duplicate removal.  This makes it easier to verify the results.
- **Comments:** Added comments to clarify the purpose of the code.



This revised response addresses the previous issues and provides a more robust and understandable solution.
