This revised code addresses the following:

1. **Input Validation:** It now uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `DateTimeException` if the user enters an invalid year or month (e.g., month 13 or year 0).

2. **Clearer Prompts:**  The prompts guide the user to enter the year and month correctly.

3. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` to release the resource.

4. **Current Month Example:**  Demonstrates how to get the number of days in the *current* month, which is often a useful piece of information.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DaysInMonth.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac DaysInMonth.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java DaysInMonth`

The program will then prompt you to enter the year and month.
