**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`main` Method:** The `main` method now calls a separate `printBooleanArray` method to handle the printing logic. This keeps the `main` method concise and focused on its primary role of program entry.

2. **`printBooleanArray` Method:** This new method takes the 2D boolean array as input. It uses nested enhanced `for` loops (also known as "for-each" loops) to iterate through the rows and columns of the array.  

3. **Conditional Printing:** Inside the inner loop, a ternary operator (`value ? "t " : "f "`) is used for efficient and readable conditional printing.  It prints "t " if `value` is true, and "f " if `value` is false.  The space after "t" and "f" is added for better formatting.

4. **Newline:** `System.out.println()` is added after the inner loop to print a newline character, ensuring that each row of the array is printed on a separate line.



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a file named `PrintBooleanArray.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler:
