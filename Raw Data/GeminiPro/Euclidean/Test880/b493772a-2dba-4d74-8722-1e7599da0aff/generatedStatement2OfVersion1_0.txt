Key improvements:

1. **Calculates 10!:**  The code now correctly calculates 10 factorial (3628800) instead of just checking for the number 10.
2. **Handles invalid input:** Includes a check to ensure the array is not null and has a length of at least 2, returning `false` if these conditions are not met.
3. **Clearer output:**  The `println` statements now show which test case is being run and the expected/actual result.
4. **Helper function for factorial:**  The `calculateTenFactorial` method makes the code more readable and reusable.
5. **More comprehensive test cases:** Added tests for various scenarios, including when 10! is at the beginning, the end, and cases where the array is too short or null.
