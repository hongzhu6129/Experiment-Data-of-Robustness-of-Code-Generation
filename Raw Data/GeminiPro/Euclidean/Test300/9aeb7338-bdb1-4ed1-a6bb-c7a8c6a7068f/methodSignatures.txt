 Only use the method signatures public static int countBitsTozeroBasedOnString(int), public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program that will accept an integer and convert it into a binary representation. Now count the number of bits equal to zero in this representation.\nExpected Output: Input first number: 25 Binary representation of 25 is: 11001 Number of zero bits: 2\n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n
