Here's how the code works:

1. **`main` method:**
   - Takes input from the user: the string and the character to search for.
   - Records the start time using `System.nanoTime()`.
   - Calls `countOccurrences` to get the count.
   - Records the end time.
   - Prints the count and calls `displayExecutionTime` to show how long it took.
   - Closes the `Scanner`.

2. **`countOccurrences` method:**
   - Iterates through the input string character by character.
   - If the current character matches the `target` character, it increments the `count`.
   - Returns the final `count`.

3. **`displayExecutionTime` method:**
   - Takes the elapsed time (calculated in `main`) as input.
   - Prints the execution time in nanoseconds.
