```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CharacterCounter {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
        String inputString = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter the character to count: ");
        char targetChar = scanner.nextLine().charAt(0);

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < inputString.length(); i++) {
            if (inputString.charAt(i) == targetChar) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Occurrences of '" + targetChar + "' in the string: " + count);

        long endTime = System.nanoTime();
        displayExecutionTime(endTime - startTime);

        scanner.close(); 
    }

    private static void displayExecutionTime(long timeElapsed) {
        System.out.println("Execution time: " + timeElapsed + " nanoseconds");
    }
}
```


Explanation and improvements:

1. **User Input:** The program now takes user input for both the string and the character to count using the `Scanner` class. This makes it more interactive.

2. **Character Counting Logic:** The core logic remains the same � iterating through the string and incrementing the `count` whenever the target character is found.

3. **Clear Output:** The output message is more informative, clearly indicating the character being counted and its total occurrences.

4. **Execution Time Measurement:**  The `displayExecutionTime` method is used to show the execution time of the counting process.

5. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed at the end of the `main` method using `scanner.close()` to release the resource. This is good practice.


Example Usage:

```
Enter a string: Hello World!
Enter the character to count: o
Occurrences of 'o' in the string: 2
Execution time: ... nanoseconds
```
