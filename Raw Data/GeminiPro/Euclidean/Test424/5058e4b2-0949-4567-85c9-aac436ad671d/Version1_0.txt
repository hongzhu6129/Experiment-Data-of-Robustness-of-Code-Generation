                count++;
            }

        displayExecutionTime(endTime - startTime);

        scanner.close();

Explanation and improvements over a simpler solution:

1. **User Input:** The code now takes user input for both the string and the character to search for, making it more flexible.
2. **Error Handling (minimal):** It handles the case where the user enters an empty string for the character to search by taking the first character of the input. A more robust solution would check for truly empty input and prompt the user again or exit gracefully.
3. **Efficiency:**  The code uses a simple `for` loop to iterate through the string, which is an efficient way to count character occurrences.
4. **Clear Output:**  The output message clearly states the character being counted and the number of times it appears.
5. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed at the end to release resources.
6. **Execution Time Measurement:**  The `displayExecutionTime` method helps to measure the performance of the code.

Example Usage:

```
Enter a string: hello world
Enter the character to count: o
The character 'o' appears 2 times in the string.
Execution time: [some nanosecond value] nanoseconds 
```
