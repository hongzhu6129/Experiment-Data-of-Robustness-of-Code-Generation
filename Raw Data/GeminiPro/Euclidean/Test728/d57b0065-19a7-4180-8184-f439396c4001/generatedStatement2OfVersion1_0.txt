Key Improvements in this code:

* **Handles Unsorted Arrays:** The `main` method now demonstrates how to handle potentially unsorted arrays by sorting them with `Arrays.sort(arr)` before calling `binarySearch`. This is crucial because binary search only works on sorted data.

* **Overflow Prevention:** The calculation of `mid` is improved to `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`. This prevents potential integer overflow issues that could occur with the previous `(low + high) / 2` calculation if `low` and `high` were very large.

* **Clearer Comments:** The comments explain the logic and the importance of sorting.

* **More Comprehensive Examples:**  The `main` method provides multiple examples, including one with an unsorted array, to highlight the requirement of a sorted array for binary search to function correctly.


Now, this code is more robust, efficient, and clearly demonstrates the correct implementation of binary search in Java.
