**Explanation and how this addresses the error:**

The error "invalid literal for int() with base 10: '\r[|'" happens when you try to convert a string that isn't a valid integer (base 10) into an integer using `Integer.parseInt()`. The specific characters `\r[|` suggest there might be extra characters or formatting issues in the input.

This improved code addresses this in the following ways:

1. **`Scanner` for robust input:** It uses a `Scanner` to read input line by line, which is generally better than `BufferedReader` for handling different types of input and potential whitespace/newline issues.

2. **`split("\\s+")`:** This splits the input line into parts based on whitespace.  This is crucial.  Your original error very likely came from trying to parse an entire line of text that *contained* an integer but also had other characters.  This approach isolates the potential integer strings.

3. **`try-catch` block around `parseInt()`:**  The most important change. This is the core of handling the "invalid literal" error.  The `try` attempts to parse the string.  If it fails (due to non-numeric characters), the `catch` block handles the `NumberFormatException`.  This prevents the program from crashing and allows you to deal with the bad input gracefully (e.g., print an error message, skip the invalid part, or use a default value).

4. **Error handling with clear messages:** The `catch` block prints informative error messages, including the invalid string that caused the problem.  This helps with debugging.

5. **Outer `try-catch` (for debugging):** An additional outer `try-catch` block is included to catch any other unexpected exceptions during line processing and print a stack trace for debugging if something goes wrong.  This is good practice, especially when working with user input or external data.

6. **Resource closing:** The `scanner.close()` ensures the `Scanner` is closed when you're done with it, releasing system resources.



**How to Use:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Main.java`.
2. **Compile:** Compile it using a Java compiler (like the one included with the JDK): `javac Main.java`
3. **Run:** Run the compiled code: `java Main`
4. **Input:** Enter your input, one line at a time.  The program will attempt to parse integers from each line, handling errors gracefully.


This revised solution is much more robust and demonstrates good practices for handling potential input errors and using `Scanner` effectively.
