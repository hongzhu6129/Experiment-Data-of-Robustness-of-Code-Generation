**Explanation:**

1. **`import java.io.File;`:** Imports the `File` class, which is essential for working with files and directories in Java.
2. **`public static void main(String[] args)`:** The main method, the entry point of the program.  It receives command-line arguments in the `args` array.
3. **`if (args.length != 1)`:**  Checks if exactly one command-line argument (the pathname) is provided. If not, prints usage instructions and exits.
4. **`String pathname = args[0];`:** Retrieves the pathname from the command-line arguments.
5. **`File file = new File(pathname);`:** Creates a `File` object representing the file or directory specified by the pathname.  This does *not* create a new file on the disk; it just creates a Java object that refers to a potential file or directory.
6. **`if (file.exists())`:** Checks if the file or directory exists using the `exists()` method.
7. **`if (file.isFile())` / `else if (file.isDirectory())`:** If the file/directory exists, checks if it's a file or a directory using the `isFile()` and `isDirectory()` methods.
8. **`System.out.println(...)`:** Prints the appropriate message based on whether the file/directory exists and its type.
9. **Illustrative `File` methods:** The code also shows how to use `canRead()`, `canWrite()`, `getAbsolutePath()`, and `length()`, which are other common and useful methods of the `File` class. These methods provide more information about the file or directory.


This improved version provides clearer error handling, handles both files and directories correctly, and demonstrates additional useful methods of the `File` class.  It's more robust and educational.
