This code demonstrates two ways to convert a String to a character array within the `main` method:

1. **`toCharArray()` Method:** The most straightforward approach, this directly returns a character array representing the string.

2. **`charAt()` and Iteration:**  This method iterates through the string using a `for` loop and retrieves each character using `charAt(i)`, assigning it to the corresponding index in a pre-allocated character array.  This demonstrates the fundamental logic behind the conversion if `toCharArray()` were not available.


The code also includes an example of taking a String from the command-line arguments and converting it to a character array. This demonstrates how to work with program inputs within the `main` method.  To run this with a command-line argument, after compiling (e.g., `javac StringToArray.java`), you would execute it like this:  `java StringToArray "Your string here"`.  Replace "Your string here" with the string you want to convert.
