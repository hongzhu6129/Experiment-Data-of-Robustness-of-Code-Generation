Key Improvements and Explanations:

1. **Clearer Explanations:** Added comments to explain the purpose of each code section and the expected output.  Explained the difference between `offer()` and `add()`.

2. **Min-Heap and Max-Heap Examples:**  Provided both a min-heap (default) and a max-heap example, showing how to use a `Comparator` to create a max-heap.

3. **`offer()` vs. `add()`:** Clarified the difference and recommended using `offer()` as it is generally safer.

4. **`peek()` and `poll()` explanation:** Added a note about the important `peek()` and `poll()` methods for accessing elements based on priority.

5. **Concise and Focused:** The code is more focused on demonstrating priority queue insertion and related concepts.

6. **Improved Formatting:** Enhanced the formatting for better readability.


This revised example provides a more comprehensive and educational demonstration of priority queue insertion in Java.
