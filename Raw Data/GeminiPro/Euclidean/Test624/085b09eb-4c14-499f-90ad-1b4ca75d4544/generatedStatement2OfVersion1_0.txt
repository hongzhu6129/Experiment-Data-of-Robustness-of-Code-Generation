Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

1. **TreeSet:**  Uses a `TreeSet` which is specifically designed for sorted sets and provides efficient methods like `headSet` for retrieval based on ordering.

2. **headSet(element, inclusive):**  The `headSet` method is used with the `inclusive` flag set to `true`.  This ensures that elements less than *or equal to* the `givenElement` are included.

3. **Clearer Example Usage:**  Provides more illustrative examples with different `givenElement` values to demonstrate the behavior in various scenarios, including when the `givenElement` is larger than all elements in the set.

4. **Concise Output:** The output is now formatted to be more readable.

5. **Comments:**  Includes comments to explain the code's logic.


This revised code directly addresses the prompt's requirements and provides a robust and efficient solution for retrieving elements less than or equal to a given value from a sorted set (tree) in Java.
