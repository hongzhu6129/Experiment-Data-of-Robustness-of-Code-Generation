Explanation of improvements:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `num1`, `num2`, `num3` makes the code easier to follow.

2. **Scanner for Input:**  Using a `Scanner` allows the program to read input from the user, making it interactive.

3. **Helper Function:** The `checkTwentyLess` function separates the logic for checking the condition, improving code organization.

4. **Absolute Difference:**  The code now uses `Math.abs()` to calculate the absolute difference.  This is essential because the problem statement doesn't specify the order of subtraction, and we want to check if *any* of the numbers is 20 or more less than the others' subtractions.  

5. **Resource Management:**  The `input.close()` statement closes the `Scanner`, which is good practice for resource management.
