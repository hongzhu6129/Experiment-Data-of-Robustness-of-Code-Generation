4. **Large Positive Integer:**
   - Input: 123456789 (or any large number within `int` range)
   - Expected Output:  Should calculate correctly without overflow (within the limits of `int` data type).

5. **Large Negative Integer:**
   - Input: -123456789 (or any large negative number within `int` range)
   - Expected Output: Should calculate correctly without overflow (within the limits of `int` data type).



**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You can manually test these cases by running the Java code and providing the inputs.  For more automated testing, you can use JUnit or TestNG (Java testing frameworks).  Here's a very basic example of how you might set up a JUnit test:
