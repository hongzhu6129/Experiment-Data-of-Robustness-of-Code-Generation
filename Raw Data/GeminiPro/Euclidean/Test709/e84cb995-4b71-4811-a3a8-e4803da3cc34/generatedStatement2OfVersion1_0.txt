Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:** The `sort` method now correctly handles null or empty input arrays.
* **Clearer variable names:** Using `lowerIndex` and `higherIndex` instead of `i` and `j` in the `quickSort` method improves readability.  Inside the loop, `i` and `j` are still used for the moving indices as that is conventional.
* **Pivot selection:** The pivot is now chosen as the middle element, which helps mitigate worst-case performance for already sorted or nearly sorted arrays.
* **Correct partitioning logic:**  The partitioning logic within the `while (i <= j)` loop is crucial for proper QuickSort functionality and is now correct.
* **Recursive calls:** The recursive calls to `quickSort` are now placed after the partitioning step, ensuring correct sorting.
* **Output:** The `main` method now uses `Arrays.toString()` to print the sorted array in a user-friendly format.


This improved version addresses potential issues and inefficiencies, providing a more robust and understandable implementation of the QuickSort algorithm.
