Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Comments:**  Explanations are more focused on the logic behind the code.
* **Conciseness:** Some redundant comments were removed.
* **Correctness:** Ensured the pivot selection and partition logic are robust.
* **Standard Practices:**  Uses more idiomatic Java style (e.g., spacing, variable names).


This refined example effectively demonstrates a functional QuickSort implementation while adhering to the requested method signatures. It's also more readable and maintainable.
