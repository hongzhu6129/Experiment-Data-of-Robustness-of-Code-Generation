**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Error Handling:** The code now checks for an invalid `position` and prints a message (or you could throw an exception). This makes the code more robust.

2. **Using ListIterators:** We efficiently reverse the portion of the list using two `ListIterator` objects. One iterates forward from the `position`, and the other iterates backward from the end of the list.  We swap elements until the iterators meet or cross.

3. **Simplified Logic:** The loop condition is now clearer and more concise.  `forwardIterator.nextIndex() < reverseIterator.previousIndex()` ensures we stop swapping when the iterators are about to cross or have met in the middle.
