            } else {
                col--; // Move left to the previous column (smaller elements)

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Use `m` and `n` for rows and columns, and `target` for the element being searched.
2. **Return an Array:**  The `Saddleback` method now returns an `int[]` containing the row and column index. This is a standard and clean way to return multiple values. If the element is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.
3. **Concise Conditionals:**  The `if/else if/else` structure within the loop is simplified for better readability.
4. **Comments:** Added more comments to explain the logic.
5. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method now demonstrates how to use `Saddleback` and handles the case where the target is not found.
6. **Test Cases:** Added a second test case to `main` to demonstrate searching for an element that is *not* present in the array. This ensures the code correctly handles that scenario.





This revised version is more robust, efficient, and follows Java coding best practices. It clearly demonstrates the Saddleback search algorithm and provides a reliable way to find an element within a sorted 2D array.
