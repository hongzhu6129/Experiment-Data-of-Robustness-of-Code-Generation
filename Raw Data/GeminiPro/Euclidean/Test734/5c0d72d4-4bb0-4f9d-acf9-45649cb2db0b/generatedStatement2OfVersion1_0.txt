Key improvements in this code:

* **Clearer variable names:** `m` and `n` represent the dimensions of the array, improving readability.
* **Returns an `int[]`:**  The `Saddleback` function now correctly returns an `int[]` containing the row and column indices.  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.
* **Handles not found case:** The `main` method now checks the return value and prints an appropriate message if the target isn't found.
* **Added test cases in main:** The `main` method now tests with both a target that exists and one that doesn't.
* **Comments:**  Comments explaining the logic are added.


This improved version addresses the previous issues and provides a more robust and understandable solution.  It correctly implements the saddleback search algorithm within the specified method signature constraints.
