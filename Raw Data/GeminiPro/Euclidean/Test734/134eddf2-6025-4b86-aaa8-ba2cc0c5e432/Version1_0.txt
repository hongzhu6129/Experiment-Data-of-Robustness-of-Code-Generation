Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature:**  The method signature `Saddleback(int[][] matrix, int m, int n, int target)` is now more informative, explicitly stating the matrix, its dimensions, and the target value.

2. **Return an Array for Coordinates:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` array to store both the row and column index of the found element. If the element is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.  This is a standard and efficient way to return multiple values from a method in Java.

3. **Concise Saddleback Search Implementation:** The `Saddleback` method efficiently implements the algorithm:
   - It starts at the top-right corner of the matrix.
   - If the current element is smaller than the target, it moves down to the next row (because the elements to the left in the current row are smaller).
   - If the current element is larger than the target, it moves left to the previous column (because the elements below in the current column are larger).
   - It continues this process until the target is found or the boundaries of the matrix are crossed.

4. **Illustrative `main` method:** The `main` method provides a clear example of how to use the `Saddleback` method and handles the case where the target is not found.  It uses a sample sorted 2D array.  I've added a second example to demonstrate what happens when the target is not present.


This revised code provides a complete, well-documented, and efficient solution to the saddleback search problem.
