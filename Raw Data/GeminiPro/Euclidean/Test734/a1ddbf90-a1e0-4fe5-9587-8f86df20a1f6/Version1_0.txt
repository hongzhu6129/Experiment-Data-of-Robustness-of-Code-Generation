**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `m` and `n` for rows and columns makes the code more readable.

2. **Return an Array:**  The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` to represent the row and column index. This is more structured than printing directly within the method. A `{-1, -1}` return value indicates that the target was not found.

3. **Boundary Checks:** The `while` loop condition `row < m && col >= 0` prevents out-of-bounds errors.

4. **Concise Return:** The `return new int[]{row, col};`  is a compact way to return the result.

5. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to call `Saddleback` and interpret the results, including handling the case where the target is not found. It also provides a sample matrix and tests with a target that is present and one that is not present.


**How Saddleback Search Works:**

Saddleback search starts at the top-right corner of the matrix. It then compares the target with the current element:

- If they are equal, the target is found.
- If the target is greater, move down to the next row (because the current row can only contain smaller values).
- If the target is smaller, move left to the previous column (because the current column can only contain larger values).


This process continues until the target is found or the boundaries of the matrix are reached.  The time complexity of saddleback search is O(m + n) where 'm' is number of rows and 'n' is number of columns. This is because in worst-case scenario, you might have to traverse an entire row and an entire column to find the target or to determine that the target is not present.
