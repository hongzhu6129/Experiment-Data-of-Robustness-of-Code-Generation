Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer User Input:** Prompts the user to enter a date and specifies the format.
* **Error Handling:** Uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters an invalid date format.
* **Date Formatting:** Consistently uses `DateTimeFormatter` for input and output, ensuring correct and readable date representation.
* **`finally` block:** Closes the `Scanner` in a `finally` block to ensure resource cleanup even if exceptions occur.
* **Concise Comparison:** The `compareDates` method makes the date comparisons more readable and organized.
* **Informative Output:**  Provides more context in the output messages, indicating which date is being compared to the current date.


This revised code is more robust, user-friendly, and adheres to best practices for date and time handling in Java.
