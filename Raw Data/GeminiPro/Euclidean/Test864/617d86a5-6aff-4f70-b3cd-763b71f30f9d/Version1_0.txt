```java
public class ApproximatePi {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double piApproximation1 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0 / 3.0) + (1.0 / 5.0) - (1.0 / 7.0) + (1.0 / 9.0) - (1.0 / 11.0));
        double piApproximation2 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0 / 3.0) + (1.0 / 5.0) - (1.0 / 7.0) + (1.0 / 9.0) - (1.0 / 11.0) + (1.0 / 13.0));

        System.out.println("Approximation 1: " + piApproximation1);
        System.out.println("Approximation 2: " + piApproximation2);
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Corrections:**

The original prompt had some errors in the formula (extra '+' where it should have been '-'). The correct Leibniz formula for approximating pi alternates adding and subtracting the reciprocals of odd numbers.  The code above implements this correctly. It calculates two approximations:

1. **`piApproximation1`**:  Up to 1/11
2. **`piApproximation2`**: Up to 1/13

It then prints both results.  The use of `1.0` instead of `1` ensures that floating-point division is performed, giving a more accurate approximation.
