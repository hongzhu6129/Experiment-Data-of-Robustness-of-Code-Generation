**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles 0 Remainder Correctly:** The crucial improvement addresses the case where `n % 26` is 0.  When the remainder is 0, it signifies that the corresponding character should be 'Z', and we need to adjust `n` by subtracting 1 before dividing by 26. This prevents off-by-one errors, especially when dealing with numbers like 26, 52, etc.

2. **`StringBuilder` for Efficiency:**  Using `StringBuilder` for constructing the column name is more efficient than repeated string concatenation (using `+`).  `StringBuilder` modifies the string in place, whereas string concatenation creates new string objects in each iteration, which is less performant.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `columnName` instead of just `s` improves readability.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes more test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the solution for different input values, including edge cases and larger numbers.  This helps in thorough verification.

5. **Insert at Beginning:** Using `columnName.insert(0, ...)` is important because we're building the string from right to left (least significant digit to most significant).  The `insert(0, ...)` method ensures that characters are added to the beginning of the string to create the correct order.


This improved version is more robust, efficient, and easier to understand. It accurately generates Excel column names for a wide range of input column numbers.
