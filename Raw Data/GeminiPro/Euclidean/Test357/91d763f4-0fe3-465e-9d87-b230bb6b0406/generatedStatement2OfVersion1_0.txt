This code adheres to the specified method signatures.  It checks if the string can be evenly divided and handles cases where it cannot.  The `main` method provides example usage.  Here's how it addresses potential issues:

* **Unequal division:**  It explicitly checks if `str_size % n` is zero. If not, it prints a message indicating the string cannot be divided equally.
* **Edge Cases:** The code works correctly even for small strings, empty strings, or large values of `n` (as long as the division is possible).  An empty string or `n=0` would result in no output, which is consistent with the expected behavior.
* **Clarity and Simplicity:**  The code is concise and easy to understand. It uses `substring` for efficient extraction of parts.
