Key improvements and explanations:

* **Multiple Methods:**  Demonstrates various techniques (putAll(), loop and put(), Stream API) for copying maps, catering to different learning styles and Java versions.
* **Shallow vs. Deep Copy Explanation:** Includes a critical discussion and example showing the implications of shallow copying using the constructor, highlighting potential pitfalls.  This is essential for robust code.
* **Helper Function:**  Uses a `printMap()` function for cleaner output and code organization, improving readability.
* **Clear Comments:**  Provides concise explanations for each method, enhancing the educational value.
* **Stream API Example (Java 8+):** Includes a modern approach using streams and collectors, broadening the learner's toolkit.
* **Efficiency Note:**  Points out that `putAll()` is generally the most efficient method.


This improved version provides a more comprehensive and practical understanding of map copying in Java, addressing potential issues and showcasing best practices.
