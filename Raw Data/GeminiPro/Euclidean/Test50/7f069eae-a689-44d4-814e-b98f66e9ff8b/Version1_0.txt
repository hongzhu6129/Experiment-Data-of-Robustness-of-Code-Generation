**Test Cases:**

**Corner Cases:**

* **Empty string:** The program should print an empty map.
* **String with only one character:** The program should print the opening and closing position of the character as the same value.

**Regular Test Cases:**

* **String with multiple characters:** The program should print the opening and closing positions of each character.
* **String with repeating characters:** The program should print the opening and closing positions of each character, even if it repeats.
* **String with non-alphabetic characters:** The program should ignore non-alphabetic characters.
* **String with uppercase and lowercase characters:** The program should treat uppercase and lowercase characters as the same character.

**Sample Input and Output:**

**Input:**

```
Hello World!
