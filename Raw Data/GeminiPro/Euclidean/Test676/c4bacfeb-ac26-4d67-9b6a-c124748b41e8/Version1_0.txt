**Explanation and Key Concepts:**

1. **NavigableMap:**  `tailMap()` is a method of the `NavigableMap` interface.  `TreeMap` is a common implementation of `NavigableMap`.  `NavigableMap` provides methods for navigating a sorted map, such as getting submaps and finding elements based on key order.

2. **tailMap(key, inclusive):**  This method returns a *view* of the portion of the map whose keys are greater than or equal to the specified `key`.  
   - If `inclusive` is `true`, the specified `key` is included in the returned map.
   - If `inclusive` is `false`, the specified `key` is *excluded* from the returned map.

3. **View:** The tail map (and submap) returned is a *view* of the original map, not a copy.  This means that changes made to the tail map will be reflected in the original map, and vice-versa.

4. **TreeMap vs. HashMap:**  `TreeMap` stores entries in sorted order based on the keys' natural ordering (or a provided `Comparator`).  `HashMap` does not guarantee any specific order. You need a `NavigableMap` (like `TreeMap`) to use `tailMap()`.

5. **subMap():** The `subMap()` method is also demonstrated.  It allows you to get a view of a portion of the map between specified start and end keys.  The `inclusive` arguments for `subMap` determine whether the start and end keys are included in the submap.


This enhanced example demonstrates the `tailMap()` method both inclusively and exclusively, clarifies that it returns a view of the original map, and also shows the related `subMap()` method for getting a map within a specified key range.  It also uses more descriptive variable names and comments to improve readability.
