**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Try-with-resources:** The code uses try-with-resources ( `try (...)` ) to ensure that the `BufferedWriter` and `BufferedReader` are automatically closed, even if exceptions occur. This is crucial for preventing resource leaks and ensuring proper file handling.

2. **Error Handling:** The code includes `try-catch` blocks to handle potential `IOExceptions` during file operations. It prints informative error messages to the console if any errors occur.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output to the console is more structured and indicates whether the write operation was successful before printing the file contents.

4. **File Name Variable:** The file name is stored in a `String` variable (`fileName`), making it easier to change if needed.

5. **Newline Characters:** Newline characters (`\n`) are added to the end of each line when writing to ensure proper line breaks in the output file.

6. **Comments:**  Comments explain the purpose of different sections of the code, improving readability.




How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ReadWriteTextFile.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler: `javac ReadWriteTextFile.java`
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program: `java ReadWriteTextFile`

This will create a file named `my_text_file.txt` in the same directory, write the specified text to it, and then read and print the contents of the file to the console.
