Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer error handling:**  The `try-catch` block catches `IOException` which is the appropriate exception type for file operations. The error message is also more informative.
* **Resource management:** The `writer` and `reader` are closed in `finally` blocks, ensuring resources are released even if errors occur.  This prevents resource leaks.  Even better, this version now uses try-with-resources, which automatically closes the resources.
* **Informative output:** The code now prints messages indicating success or failure and clearly displays the file contents.
* **File path variable:** The file path is stored in a variable making it easier to change.


This revised code provides a more robust and user-friendly solution for writing and reading text files in Java.
