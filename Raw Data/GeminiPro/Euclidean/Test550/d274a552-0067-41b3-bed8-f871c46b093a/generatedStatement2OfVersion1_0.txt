Key improvements and explanations:

* **Try-with-resources:** Uses try-with-resources ( `try (...)` ) to automatically close the file resources ( `BufferedWriter` and `BufferedReader` ), preventing resource leaks.  This is the best practice for file I/O in Java.
* **Clearer Error Handling:** Includes `catch` blocks to handle potential `IOExceptions` and print informative error messages.
* **Appending Demonstrated:** Shows how to append to a file by using `FileWriter(filePath, true)`.  The `true` argument enables append mode.
* **newLine():** Uses `writer.newLine()` to add newlines when appending to the file, making the output more readable.
* **Comments:**  Explanatory comments make the code easier to understand.
* **Combined Read and Write:**  Demonstrates both writing and reading in a single example for a complete tutorial.
