**Test Cases:**

1. **Valid Octal Number:**
   - Input: 123
   - Expected Output: 83

2. **Octal Number with Leading Zero:**
   - Input: 0123
   - Expected Output: 83  (Leading zeros should be handled correctly)

3. **Single Digit Octal Number:**
   - Input: 7
   - Expected Output: 7

4. **Zero:**
   - Input: 0
   - Expected Output: 0

5. **Invalid Octal Number (Contains 8):**
   - Input: 128
   - Expected Output: "Invalid octal number: Contains characters other than 0-7."

6. **Invalid Octal Number (Contains a letter):**
   - Input: 1A3
   - Expected Output: "Invalid octal number: Contains characters other than 0-7."

7. **Empty Input:**
   - Input: "" (just press enter)
   - Expected Output: 0 (Or handle as an error - depends on your requirements)

8. **Large Octal Number (Check for overflow):**
    - Input: 777777777777777777777 (A very large octal number)
    - Expected Output:  "Invalid input. The number might be too large." (The program should gracefully handle potential overflow).



**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Input Validation:**  The code now includes robust input validation to check for invalid characters (anything other than 0-7).  This prevents unexpected behavior or crashes.
* **Clear Error Messages:** More descriptive error messages help users understand what went wrong with their input.
* **Overflow Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles potential `NumberFormatException` if the input octal number is so large that it leads to a `long` overflow.
* **Handles Leading Zero:** The code correctly handles octal numbers with leading zeros.
* **Efficiency:** Iterating from right to left is a standard and efficient way to convert numbers between bases.
* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is well-commented and easy to understand.



This improved version addresses the potential issues and provides a more robust and user-friendly solution for octal to decimal conversion. Remember to test all the corner cases thoroughly to ensure correctness.
