   - **How to Test:**  Run the program and visually inspect the console output to ensure it matches the expected output.  You can also redirect the output to a file (e.g., `java HelloWorld > output.txt`) and then compare the file contents to the expected output.

2. **Name Change:**  (Not a true "corner case," but good practice)
   - **Change:** Replace "Your Name" in the code with different names (e.g., very long names, names with special characters, empty strings).
   - **Expected Output:** "Hello" should always be printed on the first line. The second line should correctly reflect the modified name.  This tests that the name printing is dynamic and not hardcoded.

3. **System.out.println() behavior:** (More of an understanding check than a test case)
   - **Understanding:**  Ensure you understand that `System.out.println()` automatically adds a newline character at the end.  This is why "Hello" and the name appear on separate lines. If you used `System.out.print()` instead, they would be on the same line.

4. **Empty Name:**
   - **Change:** Replace "Your Name" with `""` (an empty string).
   - **Expected Output:** "Hello" on the first line, followed by a blank line. This verifies the program handles empty names gracefully.


**How to run the Java program and test it:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `HelloWorld.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac HelloWorld.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java HelloWorld`
