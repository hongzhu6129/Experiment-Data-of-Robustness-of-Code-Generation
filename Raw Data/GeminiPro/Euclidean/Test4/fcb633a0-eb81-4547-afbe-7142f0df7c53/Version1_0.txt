```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CircleCalculations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Using a Scanner for potential user input (though currently fixed at 7.5)
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the radius of the circle: ");
        double radius = input.nextDouble(); // Change this to input.nextDouble() for user input

        // Calculate the perimeter (circumference) and area
        double perimeter = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
        double area = Math.PI * radius * radius;

        // Print the results formatted to a reasonable number of decimal places
        System.out.printf("Perimeter is = %.2f\n", perimeter);
        System.out.printf("Area is = %.2f\n", area);
        input.close(); // Close the scanner
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases and corner cases you can use to verify the program:

1. **Standard Case (Given Example):**
   - Input: `radius = 7.5`
   - Expected Output:
     - Perimeter: approximately `47.12`
     - Area: approximately `176.71`

2. **Zero Radius:**
   - Input: `radius = 0`
   - Expected Output:
     - Perimeter: `0`
     - Area: `0`

3. **Negative Radius (Invalid Input - Should be handled):**
   - Input: `radius = -5`
   - Expected Behavior: The program should ideally handle this gracefully, either by throwing an exception or printing an error message indicating that the radius cannot be negative.  A simple modification to handle this could be:

   ```java
       if (radius < 0) {
           System.out.println("Error: Radius cannot be negative.");
           return; // Or throw an exception
       }
   ```

4. **Very Large Radius:**
   - Input: `radius = 100000`
   - Expected Output:  (Check for potential overflow issues, though doubles have a large range)
     - Perimeter and Area will be very large values.  Verify the calculations are still correct.

5. **Small Radius:**
   - Input: `radius = 0.001`
   - Expected Output: Check for correct handling of small decimal values.

6. **Integer Radius:**
   - Input: `radius = 10`
   - Expected Output: Verify that integer inputs are handled correctly.


**How to Test:**

1. **Manual Input:**  Run the program and enter the test case input values one by one. Compare the output with the expected values.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):** Use a testing framework like JUnit to automate the tests.  This is much more efficient, especially for regression testing.  Here's a simple JUnit example:


```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class CircleCalculationsTest {

    @Test
    void testStandardCase() {
        double radius = 7.5;
        double expectedPerimeter = 47.12;  // Use approximate values for floating-point comparisons
        double expectedArea = 176.71;
        // ... (Call your calculation functions and use assertEquals with a delta for floating-point comparisons)
    }

   // ... Add more test methods for the other test cases
}
```


By using a combination of these test cases and automated testing, you can ensure your `CircleCalculations` program is robust and handles various inputs correctly. Remember to test for invalid input and boundary conditions.
