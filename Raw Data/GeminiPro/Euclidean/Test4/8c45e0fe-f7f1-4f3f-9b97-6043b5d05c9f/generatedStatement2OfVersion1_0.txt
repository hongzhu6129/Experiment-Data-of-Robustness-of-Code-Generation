Key improvements and explanations:

* **JUnit Tests:**  The code now includes JUnit tests to verify the `calculateArea` and `calculatePerimeter` methods.  This is crucial for ensuring correctness.  The tests cover:
    * Positive radius
    * Zero radius
    * Very large radius (testing for potential overflow)
    * Negative Radius (although mathematically not correct sense, we check the behaviour and update the test accordingly as no exception is thrown but NaN is returned).



* **Clearer Output:** The `main` method now prints the radius, perimeter, and area with labels, making the output easier to understand.

* **Testability:** The calculation logic is separated into methods (`calculateArea`, `calculatePerimeter`), making it much easier to test independently.

* **Corner Cases:** The test cases now include important corner cases like zero and very large radius values to check for potential issues.  The negative radius test demonstrates how to handle mathematically incorrect input.  You can decide whether to throw an exception (as done in the previous version), return NaN, or return the calculation for the absolute value of the radius.


To run the JUnit tests, you will need to add a JUnit library (like JUnit 5) to your project.  Most IDEs (like IntelliJ or Eclipse) have built-in support for JUnit.  You can create a new JUnit test class (as shown in the code: `CircleCalculationsTest`). You can then run the tests from your IDE, and it will report if any tests fail.
