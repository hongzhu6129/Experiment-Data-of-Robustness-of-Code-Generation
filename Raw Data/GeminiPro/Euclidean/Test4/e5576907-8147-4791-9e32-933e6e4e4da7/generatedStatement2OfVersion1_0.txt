**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner/edge cases:

1. **Normal Case:**
   - Input: `radius = 7.5`
   - Expected Output: 
     - Perimeter: `47.12`
     - Area: `176.71`

2. **Zero Radius:**
   - Input: `radius = 0`
   - Expected Output:
     - Perimeter: `0.00`
     - Area: `0.00`

3. **Negative Radius (Invalid Input):**  Although mathematically not meaningful, it's good to test how your program handles invalid input.
   - Input: `radius = -5`
   - Expected Behavior: The program should ideally handle this gracefully, perhaps by printing an error message or returning a special value (like `NaN` - Not a Number) to indicate an invalid result.  The current code will calculate results as though the radius were positive.  You may want to add error handling.  For example:
