```java
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.GregorianCalendar;

public class MinimumValues {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Get the current date and time
        Calendar currentDate = new GregorianCalendar();

        // Create a calendar representing 1997, January 1st (minimum values we're interested in)
        Calendar minDate = new GregorianCalendar(1997, Calendar.JANUARY, 1);

        // Get the minimum values
        int minYear = 1997; // Already specified as the minimum
        int minMonth = Math.min(currentDate.get(Calendar.MONTH), minDate.get(Calendar.MONTH));
        int minWeekOfYear = Math.min(currentDate.get(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR), minDate.get(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR)); // Caution: Week of year can be tricky due to calendar systems and locale
        int minDayOfMonth = Math.min(currentDate.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH), minDate.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH));


        System.out.println("Minimum Year: " + minYear);
        System.out.println("Minimum Month (0-indexed): " + minMonth);  // Months are 0-indexed (January=0)
        System.out.println("Minimum Week of Year: " + minWeekOfYear); // Be cautious about week of year interpretation
        System.out.println("Minimum Day of Month: " + minDayOfMonth);



    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic and potential issues.
2. **`GregorianCalendar`:**  Uses `GregorianCalendar` which is the concrete implementation typically used.
3. **Minimum Year Handling:**  The minimum year is already known (1997), so no comparison is needed.
4. **Month Indexing:** Clarified that months are 0-indexed in `Calendar`.
5. **Week of Year Caution:**  Added a cautionary note about the `WEEK_OF_YEAR` field.  Its interpretation can vary depending on locale and calendar systems, so direct comparison may not always be what you expect. If you need more consistent week calculations, consider using libraries like `java.time` (Java 8+).
6. **Direct `Math.min()`:**  Used `Math.min()` for a more concise way to get the minimum values.


If you're using Java 8 or later, consider using the `java.time` package (e.g., `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, etc.) as it provides a more modern and robust approach to date and time handling.
