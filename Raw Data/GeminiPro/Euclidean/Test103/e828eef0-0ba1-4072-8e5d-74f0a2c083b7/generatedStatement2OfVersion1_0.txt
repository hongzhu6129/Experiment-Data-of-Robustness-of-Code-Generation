Key improvements in this revised code:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `n1`, `n2`, and `merged` make the code easier to understand.
2. **Conciseness:** The merging logic is efficiently handled within the `while` loops.
3. **Correctness:**  The code correctly merges the two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
4. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `merge` method with sample data.
5. **Comments:**  Comments are strategically added to explain the code's functionality.


This revised code directly addresses the prompt's requirements by merging two sorted integer arrays within a single `main` method.  It is well-formatted, functional, and easier to follow.
