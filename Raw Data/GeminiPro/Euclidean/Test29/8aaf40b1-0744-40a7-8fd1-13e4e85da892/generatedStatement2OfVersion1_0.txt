**Explanation of Corner Cases and How They're Handled:**

* **Zero or Negative Side Length:** A hexagon cannot have a side length of zero or less. The code explicitly checks for this condition using `if (side <= 0)` and prints an error message if the input is invalid. This prevents the calculation from proceeding with incorrect values and potentially producing nonsensical results (like a negative area).

* **Small Side Length:**  While not strictly a corner case, testing with a small side length ensures the calculation handles decimal values correctly.

* **Large Side Length:**  Testing with a large side length verifies that the calculation doesn't overflow or produce unexpected results due to the limitations of floating-point arithmetic.


**Why no other methods were used (as requested by the prompt):**

The prompt specifically asked to avoid using any methods other than those essential. The provided solution uses only the `main` method, standard input/output (using `Scanner` and `System.out`), basic arithmetic operators, `Math.sqrt()`, and a conditional statement (`if`). This adheres to the prompt's restriction while still providing a complete and functional program.  Using a separate method for the area calculation would have been better design (for reusability and organization), but we followed the prompt's constraints.
