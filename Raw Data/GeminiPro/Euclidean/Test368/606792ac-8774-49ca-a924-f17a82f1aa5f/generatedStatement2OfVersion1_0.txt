Key Improvements:

- **Case-Insensitive:** Handles both uppercase and lowercase characters by converting the input string to lowercase.
- **Clearer Output:**  Indicates when no duplicates are found and uses a flag to avoid extra spaces in the output.
- **Improved `showDuplicates`:**  Combines the counting and duplicate display logic within `showDuplicates` more effectively.
- **Example Usage in `main`:** Demonstrates with different test cases, including one with all duplicate characters and one with no duplicates.
- **Commented-out Character Count Display:**  Provides an example of how to use `CountCharacters` to display individual character counts if needed.
- **Adherence to method signatures:** The solution sticks to the provided `CountCharacters`, `showDuplicates`, and `main` method signatures.
