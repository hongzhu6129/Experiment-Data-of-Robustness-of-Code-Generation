Explanation:

1. **Node Class:**  Represents a node in the ternary tree. It stores the data and pointers to its left, mid, and right children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):**
   - This recursive method calculates the maximum depth.
   - **Base Case:** If the node is null (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:** It recursively calculates the depth of the left, mid, and right subtrees.
   - It then returns the maximum of those depths + 1 (to account for the current node).

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - Creates sample ternary trees for testing.
   - Creates an instance of `TernaryTreeDepth`.
   - Calls the `maxDepth()` method to calculate and print the maximum depth of the trees. Includes test cases with different tree structures and an empty tree to ensure the code handles various scenarios correctly.
