**Java Program:**

```java
public class Successor {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a string.
        String str = "networks";

        // Find the successor of the last character in the string.
        char successor = (char) ((str.charAt(str.length() - 1) + 1));

        // Print the successor.
        System.out.println("The successor of the last character in the string is: " + successor);
    }
}
```

**Sample Output:**

```
The successor of the last character in the string is: o
```

**Test Cases:**

**Corner Cases:**

* **Empty string:** The successor of the last character in an empty string is undefined.
* **Single character string:** The successor of the last character in a single character string is the character that comes after it in the alphabet.

**Valid Cases:**

* **String with multiple characters:** The successor of the last character in a string with multiple characters is the character that comes after it in the alphabet.
* **String with the last character being 'z':** The successor of the last character in a string with the last character being 'z' is 'a'.
