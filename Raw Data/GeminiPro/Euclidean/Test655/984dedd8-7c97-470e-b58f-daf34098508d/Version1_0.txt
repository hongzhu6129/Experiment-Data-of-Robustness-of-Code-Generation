Explanation:

1. **TreeMap and ConcurrentSkipListMap:**  A `TreeMap` is a sorted map implementation using a red-black tree.  A `ConcurrentSkipListMap` is a concurrent implementation of a sorted map using a skip list, making it suitable for multi-threaded environments and providing better performance for concurrent access than a synchronized TreeMap.  Since you want a "timeline," which implies ordering and potentially concurrent access, `ConcurrentSkipListMap` is a good choice.

2. **Copying the Content:**
   - **`putAll()` Method:** The simplest way to copy the content of one map to another is using the `putAll()` method.  This works with any `Map` implementation.
   - **Constructor:** `ConcurrentSkipListMap` provides a constructor that accepts a `SortedMap` (which `TreeMap` implements).  This directly creates a new `ConcurrentSkipListMap` with the contents of the provided `TreeMap`.

3. **Printing the Timeline:** The `printTimeline` method helps to display the content of the created timelines in a formatted way.

4. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to create a sample `TreeMap`, copy its contents to `ConcurrentSkipListMap` instances using both methods, and then print the resulting timelines.


Important Notes:

* **Thread Safety:** `ConcurrentSkipListMap` is designed for concurrent access.  If you don't require thread safety, you could use a regular `TreeMap` for the target timeline as well.
* **Sorted Order:** Both `TreeMap` and `ConcurrentSkipListMap` maintain elements in sorted order based on the natural ordering of keys or a provided `Comparator`.
* **Key Uniqueness:**  Map keys must be unique.  If the source `TreeMap` contains duplicate keys (which it shouldn't), only one entry with that key will be copied to the timeline.
