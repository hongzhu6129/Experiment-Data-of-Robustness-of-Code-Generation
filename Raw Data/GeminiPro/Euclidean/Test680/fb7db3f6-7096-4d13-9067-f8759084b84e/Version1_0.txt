```java
public class RoundUpIntegerDivision {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numerator = 17;
        int denominator = 5;

        // Using Math.ceil to round up the result of the division
        int roundedUpResult = (int) Math.ceil((double) numerator / denominator); 

        System.out.println("Numerator: " + numerator);
        System.out.println("Denominator: " + denominator);
        System.out.println("Rounded up result: " + roundedUpResult);



        //Demonstrating with other examples
        demonstrateRounding(7, 3);   // Output: 3
        demonstrateRounding(10, 2);  // Output: 5
        demonstrateRounding(5, 6);   // Output: 1 (because 5/6 is less than 1, it rounds up to 1)
        demonstrateRounding(-7, 3);  // Output: -2 (rounds towards positive infinity)
        demonstrateRounding(7,-3);  // Output: -2 (rounds towards positive infinity)



    }

    //Helper function to avoid repeating code in main for demonstration purposes.
    public static void demonstrateRounding(int num, int den) {
         int result = (int) Math.ceil((double) num / den);
         System.out.println(num + " / " + den + " rounded up = " + result);
    }
}

**Explanation and Key improvements:**

1. **Casting to double:**  Crucially, we cast `numerator` to `double` *before* the division.  This ensures that the division itself is performed using floating-point arithmetic, which gives us a more accurate result (including the fractional part). If we don't cast, integer division truncates the decimal portion, leading to incorrect rounding.

2. **Math.ceil():**  `Math.ceil()` is the correct function to use for rounding *up* towards positive infinity.  It takes a `double` argument and returns the smallest `double` value that is greater than or equal to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer.

3. **Casting back to int:**  After using `Math.ceil()`, we cast the result back to `int` to get the final rounded-up integer value.

4. **Clearer Output:**  The output now clearly labels the numerator, denominator, and the rounded-up result, making it easier to understand.

5. **More Examples:** The `demonstrateRounding()` helper function and additional examples in `main` illustrate the behavior of the rounding logic with various inputs, including negative numbers, which helps clarify edge cases and provides more comprehensive testing.


**How `Math.ceil()` handles different cases:**

* **Positive numerator, positive denominator:** Rounds up to the nearest integer.
* **Negative numerator, positive denominator:** Rounds "up" towards positive infinity (becomes a smaller negative integer or zero).
* **Positive numerator, negative denominator:** Rounds "up" towards positive infinity (becomes a smaller negative integer or zero).
* **Negative numerator, negative denominator:**  Rounds up to the nearest integer.


This improved code addresses the original issue and provides a more robust and understandable solution for rounding up integer division results in Java.
