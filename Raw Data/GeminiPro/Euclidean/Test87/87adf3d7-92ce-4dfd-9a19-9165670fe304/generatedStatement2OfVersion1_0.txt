Key improvements in this code:

* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is structured more clearly, with better variable names and comments explaining the logic.
* **Efficiency:**  The loop breaks early if adjacent 20s are found, avoiding unnecessary iterations.
* **Correctness:** The logic now accurately handles all the specified cases.
* **Testability:** The `main` method includes test cases to demonstrate the functionality.


This improved version provides a robust and easy-to-understand solution to the problem.
