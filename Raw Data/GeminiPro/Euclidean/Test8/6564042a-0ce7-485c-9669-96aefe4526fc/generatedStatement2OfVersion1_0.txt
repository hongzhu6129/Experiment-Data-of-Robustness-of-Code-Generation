Key improvements and explanations:

* **JUnit Tests:**  The code now includes JUnit tests to verify the `getArea()` and `getPerimeter()` methods. This makes the code more robust and easier to maintain.  The tests cover standard cases, a square (a special case of a rectangle), and zero length/width cases.
* **Corner Case Handling:** The code handles zero length and width. This is done directly in the tests, asserting that the area is 0 when either dimension is 0 and that the perimeter correctly adjusts when either dimension is 0.
* **Invalid Input Handling (Improved):** The `Rectangle` constructor now throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if either the length or width is negative. This prevents the creation of invalid `Rectangle` objects.  JUnit tests verify that the exceptions are thrown as expected.
* **Clearer `main` Method:** The `main` method now demonstrates basic usage and also shows how the exception handling works.
