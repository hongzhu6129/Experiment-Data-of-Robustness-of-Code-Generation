   Replace `8` with any number you want to generate the multiplication table for.


**Explanation:**

* The `main` method takes the command-line arguments as a `String` array.
* It first checks if any argument was provided. If not, it prints an error message.
* It uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters non-numeric input.
* `Integer.parseInt(args[0])` converts the first command-line argument (which is a `String`) to an integer.
* The `for` loop iterates from 1 to 10, printing each line of the multiplication table using string concatenation and the multiplication operator.


This revised version adheres to the prompt's requirement to only use the `public static void main(String[] args)` signature and handles invalid input gracefully. It also prints the "Input a number" line as requested.
