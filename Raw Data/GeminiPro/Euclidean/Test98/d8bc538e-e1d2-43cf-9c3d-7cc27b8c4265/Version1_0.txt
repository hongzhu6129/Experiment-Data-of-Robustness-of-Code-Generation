```java
public class Staircase {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; // Example number of coins

        int currentRow = 1;
        int coinsInRow = 0;
        int coinsUsed = 0;

        while (coinsUsed < n) {
            // Build current row
            StringBuilder row = new StringBuilder();
            for (int i = 0; i < currentRow; i++) {
                if (coinsUsed < n) {
                    row.append("M"); // Minted coin
                    coinsUsed++;
                    coinsInRow++;
                } else {
                    row.append(" "); // Empty space if we run out of coins
                }
            }

            // Print row with leading spaces for alignment
            for (int i = 0; i < (n- coinsInRow); i++) {
                System.out.print(" "); // Adjust spacing as needed
            }


            System.out.println(row);

            currentRow++;
            coinsInRow= 0 ;// Reset for next row

           
        }
    }
}
```


Here's how this code works:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n`:  The total number of coins.  You can change this value.
   - `currentRow`: Keeps track of the current row number (starts at 1).
   - `coinsInRow`:  Counts the coins in the current row.
   - `coinsUsed`: The total number of coins used so far.

2. **Looping Through Rows (`while` loop):**
   - The `while` loop continues as long as we haven't used all `n` coins (`coinsUsed < n`).

3. **Building Each Row (`for` loop):**
   - The inner `for` loop builds the current row (`currentRow` coins).
   - Inside the loop:
     - If we have coins left (`coinsUsed < n`), we append "M" (minted coin) to the `row` string and increment `coinsUsed` and `coinsInRow`.
     - If we run out of coins, we append a space " " to maintain the staircase structure.

4. **Printing with Alignment:**
    - We use a `for` loop to print leading spaces. The number of spaces is determined by `n - coinsInRow`. These leading spaces ensure that the staircase is aligned to the right. The correct spacing value might need adjustment depending on your output requirements (e.g. even spacing between coins)

5. **Incrementing and Resetting:**
   - After printing a row, we increment `currentRow` to prepare for the next row.
   - We reset `coinsInRow` to 0 to start counting coins for the new row.


**Example Output (n = 10):**

```
          M
         MM
        MMM
       MMMM
      MMMMM
     MMMMMM
    MMMMMMM
   MMMMMMMM
  MMMMMMMMM
 MMMMMMMMMM 
```
