Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

* **Clear Javadoc documentation:** The `removeDuplicates` method now has comprehensive Javadoc explaining its purpose, parameters, return value, and providing a clear example.
* **Handles edge cases:**  The code explicitly handles empty (`nums.length == 0`) and null (`nums == null`) input arrays.
* **In-place modification:**  The method directly modifies the original `nums` array as requested, and the return value indicates the new logical length.
* **Main method with examples:** The `main` method demonstrates the usage of the `removeDuplicates` method with various examples, including edge cases, making the educational aspect much clearer.  It uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant part of the modified array.
* **Conciseness and Readability:** The code is written in a clear and concise manner, making it easier to understand and learn from.



This improved version addresses the prompt's requirements effectively and provides a better educational example.
