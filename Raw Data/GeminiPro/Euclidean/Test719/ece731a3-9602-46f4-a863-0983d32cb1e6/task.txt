80. write a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the combsort algorithm. the comb sort is a variant of the bubble sort. like the shell sort, the comb sort increases the gap used in comparisons and exchanges. some implementations use the insertion sort once the gap is less than a certain amount. the basic idea is to eliminate turtles, or small values near the end of the list, since in a bubble sort these slow the sorting pushed tremendously. rabbits, large values around the beginning of the list do not pose a problem in a bubble sort.
The programming language is Java.
