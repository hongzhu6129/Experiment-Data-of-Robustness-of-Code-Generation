**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:**  The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that can occur during file reading.  This is crucial for robust code.  It prints an error message if the file is not found or if there's another issue.

2. **Resource Management (try-with-resources):** The `BufferedReader` is now used within a `try-with-resources` block. This ensures that the `BufferedReader` (and the underlying `FileReader`) are automatically closed, even if exceptions occur. This prevents resource leaks.

3. **ArrayList for Dynamic Sizing:** Instead of a fixed-size array, the code uses an `ArrayList` to store the lines.  `ArrayList` dynamically grows as needed, so you don't need to know the number of lines in the file beforehand.  This is much more flexible and efficient.

4. **Conversion to Array (if necessary):** If you absolutely *must* have an array at the end (though a `List` is usually preferable), the code shows how to convert the `ArrayList` to a `String` array using `lines.toArray(new String[0])`.

5. **Clearer Variable Names:** The variable names are more descriptive (e.g., `lines`, `filePath`).


**How to Use:**

1. **Replace `"your_file_path.txt"`:** Change this placeholder to the actual path of your text file.  For example: `"C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\my_text_file.txt"` or `"/home/yourname/documents/my_text_file.txt"`.
2. **Compile and Run:** Compile the Java code and then run it. The contents of the file, line by line, will be printed to the console.



This improved version is more robust, efficient, and follows best practices for file handling and resource management in Java.  It is strongly recommended to use a `List` unless you have a very specific reason to use an array.
