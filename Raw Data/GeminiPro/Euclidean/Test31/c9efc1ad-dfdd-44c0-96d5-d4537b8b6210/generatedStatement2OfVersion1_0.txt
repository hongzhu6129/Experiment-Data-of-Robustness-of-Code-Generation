**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Example Case (Provided in Prompt):**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -70
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0 
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0   (Longitude doesn't matter at poles)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

4. **Opposite Sides of the Earth (Antipodes):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 110 
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

5. **Points near the 180th Meridian (Date Line):**
   - lat1: 10
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 10
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Distance: Small value (shouldn't be a huge distance due to date line wrap)


6. **Points with large longitude differences (but not antipodes):**
   - lat1: 30
   - lon1: 10
   - lat2: 30
   - lon2: 170
   - Expected Distance:  Significant but less than half Earth's circumference.

7. **Zero Latitude and Longitude:**
    - lat1: 0
    - lon1: 0
    - lat2: 10
    - lon2: 10
    - Expected Distance: ~1565.48


**How to use these test cases:**

You can either:

* **Manually Input:** Run the program multiple times, entering the latitude and longitude values from each test case.  Compare the outputted distance to the expected distance.
* **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  Write unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit. This makes it much easier to run these tests repeatedly and ensures your code behaves correctly as you make changes. Here's a simple example using JUnit:
