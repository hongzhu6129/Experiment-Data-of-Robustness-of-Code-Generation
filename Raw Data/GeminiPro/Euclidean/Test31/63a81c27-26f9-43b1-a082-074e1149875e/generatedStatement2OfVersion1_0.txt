**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Same Coordinates:**
   - lat1 = 25, lon1 = 35
   - lat2 = 25, lon2 = 35
   - Expected Distance: 0

2. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1 = 25, lon1 = 35
   - lat2 = 35.5, lon2 = 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08

3. **Antipodal Points (Opposite sides of Earth):**
   - lat1 = 0, lon1 = 0
   - lat2 = 0, lon2 = 180
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08  (approximately Earth's diameter * pi / 2)

4. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1 = 90, lon1 = 0  (North Pole)
   - lat2 = -90, lon2 = 0 (South Pole)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08

5. **Points near the Poles:**
   - lat1 = 89.9, lon1 = 0
   - lat2 = 89.5, lon2 = 180
   - Expected Distance: A value close to but less than the pole-to-pole distance.


6. **Points with Large Longitude Differences (crossing 180�):**
   - lat1 = 0, lon1 = 179
   - lat2 = 0, lon2 = -179
   - Expected Distance: A small value as the points are close despite the longitude difference.


7. **Zero Latitude and Different Longitudes:**
    - lat1 = 0, lon1 = 0
    - lat2 = 0, lon2 = 90
    - Expected Distance: ~10007.54 (quarter of Earth's circumference)


8. **Invalid Inputs (handle gracefully):**
   - lat1 = "abc", lon1 = 35  (non-numeric input)
   - lat2 = 35.5, lon2 = 25.5
   - Expected:  The program should handle this error (e.g., display an error message or use exception handling) and not crash.  Consider adding `try-catch` blocks around the `input.nextDouble()` calls.


**How to Test:**

You can test these cases by either:

* **Manually entering the values** into the console when prompted.
* **Modifying the `main` method** to hardcode the test values and compare the output to the expected distances.  This is more efficient for multiple tests. For example:
