        double lat1 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble()); // Convert to radians

        System.out.print("Input the longitude of coordinate 1: ");
        double lon1 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble()); // Convert to radians

        System.out.print("Input the latitude of coordinate 2: ");
        double lat2 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble()); // Convert to radians

        System.out.print("Input the longitude of coordinate 2: ");
        double lon2 = Math.toRadians(input.nextDouble()); // Convert to radians

        double radius = 6371.01; // Earth's radius in kilometers

        double distance = radius * Math.acos(Math.sin(lat1) * Math.sin(lat2) + Math.cos(lat1) * Math.cos(lat2) * Math.cos(lon1 - lon2));

**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner and edge cases, to thoroughly test the Java program:

1. **Example Case (Provided in the Prompt):**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Output: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40.7128
   - lon1: -74.0060 (New York City)
   - lat2: 40.7128
   - lon2: -74.0060
   - Expected Output: 0 km

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90 (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0 
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0  (Longitude doesn't matter much at the poles)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

4. **Antipodal Points (Opposite sides of the Earth):**
   - lat1: 40.7128 (New York City)
   - lon1: -74.0060
   - lat2: -40.7128
   - lon2: 105.9940 (approximately 180 degrees opposite longitude)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km


5. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 90
   - Expected Output: ~10007.54 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 4 because of 90-degree longitude difference).

6. **Points near the International Date Line:**
    - lat1: 10
    - lon1: 179
    - lat2: 10
    - lon2: -179
    - Expected Output: A small distance (because these points are close to each other but on opposite sides of the date line).


7. **Invalid Input:**
   - Try entering non-numeric values or latitudes outside the range -90 to +90 or longitudes outside -180 to +180. The program should handle these invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., print an error message or throw an exception).  You might add input validation to your code for this.


These test cases cover a good range of scenarios, including points at extreme latitudes, points close together, points far apart, and potential edge cases near the poles and the International Date Line. By running your program with these inputs, you can verify its correctness and identify any potential issues.
