        int target = 12;
        int result = ternary_search(arr, 0, arr.length - 1, target);

        if (result == -1) {

        } else {
            System.out.println("Element found at index: " + result);
        }
        

        target = 22; // Test for element not present.
        result = ternary_search(arr, 0, arr.length - 1, target);

        if (result == -1) {

    static int ternary_search(int[] arr, int left, int right, int target) {
        if (right >= left) {
            int mid1 = left + (right - left) / 3;
            int mid2 = right - (right - left) / 3;

            if (arr[mid1] == target) {
                return mid1;
            }
            if (arr[mid2] == target) {
                return mid2;
            }

            if (target < arr[mid1]) {
                return ternary_search(arr, left, mid1 - 1, target);
            } else if (target > arr[mid2]) {
                return ternary_search(arr, mid2 + 1, right, target);
            } else {
                return ternary_search(arr, mid1 + 1, mid2 - 1, target);

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Used `left` and `right` instead of `l` and `r` for better readability.
2. **mid1 and mid2 Calculation:**  The calculation of `mid1` and `mid2` is improved to avoid potential integer overflow issues, especially with very large arrays.  We now use:
   ```java
   int mid1 = left + (right - left) / 3;
   int mid2 = right - (right - left) / 3;
   ```
3. **Comprehensive Testing in main():** The `main` method now includes tests for both a present and a non-present element, demonstrating how to handle the `-1` return value (element not found).
4. **Comments and Explanations:** Added comments to explain the logic within the `ternary_search` method.
5. **Return -1 for Element Not Found:** The method now explicitly returns `-1` if the target element is not found in the array. This makes it easier for the calling code to handle this case.


This revised code is more robust, readable, and demonstrates proper handling of the case where the element is not found.  It also uses best practices for calculating the midpoints in the ternary search to avoid potential integer overflow.
