```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AsciiValue {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a character: ");
        String input = scanner.nextLine();

        if (input.length() != 1) {
            System.out.println("Please enter a single character.");
            return; // Exit if the input is not a single character
        }

        char character = input.charAt(0);
        int asciiValue = (int) character;

        System.out.println("The ASCII value of '" + character + "' is: " + asciiValue);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Basic Characters:**
   - Input: `A`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of 'A' is: 65`
   - Input: `a`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of 'a' is: 97`
   - Input: `5`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of '5' is: 53`

2. **Special Characters:**
   - Input: `!`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of '!' is: 33`
   - Input: `@`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of '@' is: 64`
   - Input: `#`
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of '#' is: 35`

3. **Whitespace Characters:**
   - Input: (space)
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of ' ' is: 32`
   - Input: `\t` (tab - enter a tab in the console)
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of '	' is: 9`
   - Input: `\n` (newline - though you'll typically enter this directly via the scanner so this test would be within the code itself. See below)


4. **Extended ASCII Characters:**
   - Input: `�` (or any character beyond the basic 127 ASCII characters.  Java uses UTF-16, so these will be handled correctly)
   - Expected Output: `The ASCII value of '�' is: 233` (The output here might vary slightly depending on your console or IDE's encoding but should represent the correct UTF-16 value).


5. **Corner Cases:**
   - **Empty Input:** Input ""  Expected Output: `Please enter a single character.`
   - **Multiple Characters:** Input: `ab` Expected Output: `Please enter a single character.`
   - **Null Input:** (Hard to directly test via console input, but in code if the `input` String was null, it would throw a `NullPointerException`.  You could consider adding a null check in a more robust program).



**Example of testing newline within the code:**

```java
char newlineChar = '\n';
int newlineAscii = (int) newlineChar;
System.out.println("The ASCII value of '\\n' is: " + newlineAscii); // Output: 10
```


By testing your program with this variety of inputs, you can ensure that it correctly handles all valid characters and appropriately manages corner cases where the input is not a single character. Remember to test with characters from different parts of the ASCII and extended ASCII/Unicode ranges.
