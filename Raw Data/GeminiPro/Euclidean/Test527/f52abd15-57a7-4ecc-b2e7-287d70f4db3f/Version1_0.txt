            int a3 = a * a * a;
            if (a3 > n) {
                break; // Optimization: If a^3 exceeds n, no need to continue
            }

            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) { // b starts from a+1 to avoid duplicates and ensure distinct pairs
                int b3 = b * b * b;
                if (a3 + b3 > n) {
                    break; // Optimization: If a^3 + b^3 exceeds n, no need to continue with this b
                }

                for (int c = 1; c <= n; c++) {

                       break;
                    }

                    for (int d = c + 1; d <= n; d++) { // d starts from c+1 for distinct pairs
                        int d3 = d * d * d;

                        if (c3 + d3 > n) {
                            break; 
                        }


                        if (a3 + b3 == c3 + d3 && a != c && a != d && b != c && b != d && a3 + b3 <= n ) {
                            System.out.println(a3 + b3 + " = " + a + "^3 + " + b + "^3 = " + c + "^3 + " + d + "^3");
                            return; // Exit after finding the first such number
                        }
                    }

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Distinct Pairs:** The code ensures that (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct pairs by starting the inner loops (for `b` and `d`) from `a + 1` and `c + 1` respectively.  This avoids solutions like 1^3 + 1^3 = 1^3 + 1^3 or 1^3 + 2^3 = 2^3 + 1^3, which are not what the problem asks for.

2. **Efficiency Optimizations:** The `break` statements inside the loops significantly improve efficiency.  They prevent unnecessary calculations when it's clear that a sum of cubes will exceed `n`.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly shows the number and its two different representations as sums of cubes.

4. **Correctness:** The added condition `a3 + b3 <= n` ensures we don't consider sums that are greater than `n` and `&& a != c && a != d && b != c && b != d` ensures distinct numbers.


This revised code is more efficient, produces more accurate results, and provides clearer output, making it a better solution to the Ramanujan number problem.
