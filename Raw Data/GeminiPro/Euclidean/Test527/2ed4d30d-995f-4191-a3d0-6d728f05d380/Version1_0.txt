```java
public class Ramanujan {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1729; // You can change the upper limit 'n' here

        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            int a3 = a * a * a;
            if (a3 > n) break; // Optimization: Stop when a^3 exceeds n

            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) { // b starts from a+1 to avoid duplicates
                int b3 = b * b * b;
                if (a3 + b3 > n) break;  // Optimization: Stop when a^3 + b^3 exceeds n

                for (int c = 1; c <= n; c++) {
                    int c3 = c * c * c;
                    if (c3 > n) break;

                    for (int d = c + 1; d <= n; d++) {
                        int d3 = d * d * d;

                        if (c3 + d3 > n) break;

                        if (a3 + b3 == c3 + d3 && a3 + b3 <= n ) {
                            if(a!=c && a!=d && b!=c && b!=d) { // Ensure they are different pairs
                                System.out.println(a3 + b3 + " = " + a + "^3 + " + b + "^3 = " + c + "^3 + " + d + "^3");
                                return; // Exit after finding the first such number
                            }

                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println("No such number found within the given range.");


    }
}
```


Here's how this code works:

1. **Outer Loops (a, b):** These loops iterate through all possible pairs of numbers `a` and `b` to calculate `a^3 + b^3`.

2. **Inner Loops (c, d):** These loops iterate through all possible pairs of numbers `c` and `d` to calculate `c^3 + d^3`.

3. **Check for Equality and Uniqueness:**  The code checks if `a^3 + b^3` is equal to `c^3 + d^3`. Crucially, it also ensures that the pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct using `if(a!=c && a!=d && b!=c && b!=d)`.  This is important to satisfy the condition "in two (or more) different ways."

4. **Optimizations:** Several optimizations are included to improve performance:
   - The loops break early if `a^3`, `b^3`, `c^3`, or `d^3` exceed `n` because the sums will also exceed `n`.
   - `b` starts from `a+1` and `d` starts from `c+1` to avoid redundant calculations (e.g., 1^3 + 2^3 is the same as 2^3 + 1^3).


5. **Output and Exit:**  Once a valid number is found, the code prints the result and exits using `return;`. If no such number is found within the given range, it prints a message indicating that.

6. **Flexibility:** You can easily change the upper limit `n` by modifying the value assigned at the beginning of the `main` method.



This improved version addresses the previous issues and provides a more efficient and correct solution to the Ramanujan number problem within the constraint of a single `main` method.
