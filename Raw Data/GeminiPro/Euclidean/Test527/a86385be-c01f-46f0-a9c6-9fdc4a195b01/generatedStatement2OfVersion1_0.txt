**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Efficiency:** The code includes several optimizations:
   - It breaks out of loops early if `a^3`, `a^3 + b^3`, or `c^3` exceeds `n`, as there's no point in continuing.
   - `b` starts from `a + 1` and `d` starts from `c + 1` to avoid duplicate pairs and ensure that `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` are distinct.

2. **Clarity:** The variable names (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `a3`, `b3`, etc.) are more descriptive than the original example.

3. **Flexibility:** You can easily change the value of `n` to search within a different range.

4. **Complete Solution:** The code now includes a message to indicate if no such number is found within the given range.

5. **Early Exit (Optional):** The `return;` statement exits the program after finding the *first* such number. If you want to find *all* such numbers up to `n`, you can remove the `return;` statement.



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type:
