To compile and run this from the command line:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CubeChecker.java`.
2. **Compile:** `javac CubeChecker.java`
3. **Run:** `java CubeChecker 8` (replace 8 with the number you want to check).



**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Input Handling:** The code now checks if exactly one argument is provided and handles potential `NumberFormatException` if the input is not a valid integer.
* **Efficiency:**  Using `Math.cbrt()` and then checking if the result is an integer is the most efficient way to determine if a number is a perfect cube.
* **Clarity:** The code is well-commented, making it easier to understand.
* **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block prevents the program from crashing if the user enters invalid input.
* **`checkCube` Method:**  A separate `checkCube` method makes the code more organized and reusable.


This improved version addresses the potential issues and makes the code more robust and user-friendly.
