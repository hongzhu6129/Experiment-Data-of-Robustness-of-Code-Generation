**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a check to ensure that the `indexToUpdate` is within the valid bounds of the array. This prevents `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. **Clearer Output:** The output now explicitly states "Updated array:" making it easier to understand the result.

3. **Command-Line Argument Option:** The code demonstrates how to get the `index` and `newValue` from command-line arguments. This makes the program more flexible, as you can update different elements without recompiling. It also includes `try-catch` to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters non-integer arguments.

4. **Two Examples:** The `main` method shows two examples: 
   - Direct update within the code.
   - Update using command-line arguments.

**How to compile and run from the command line:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `UpdateArrayElement.java`.

2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:
