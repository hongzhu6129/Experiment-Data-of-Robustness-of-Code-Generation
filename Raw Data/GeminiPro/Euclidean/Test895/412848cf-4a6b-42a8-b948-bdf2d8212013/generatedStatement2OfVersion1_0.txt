Explanation:

1. **`removeElement(int[] nums, int val)`:**
   - Takes the integer array `nums` and the value `val` to be removed as input.
   - Initializes `k` to 0. `k` will keep track of the index where the next non-`val` element should be placed.
   - Iterates through the `nums` array.
   - If `nums[i]` is not equal to `val`, it means we want to keep this element. So, we copy it to `nums[k]` and increment `k`.
   - Finally, returns `k`, which represents the new length of the array (containing only elements different from `val`).

2. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - Creates a sample array `nums` and sets the value to be removed (`val`).
   - Prints the original array.
   - Calls `removeElement` to modify the array and get the new length.
   - Prints the new length.
   - (Optional) Prints the updated array for better visualization.


Key Improvements:

- **In-place Modification:** The `removeElement` function modifies the input array directly instead of creating a new one, making it more memory-efficient.
- **Clearer Variable Naming:** Using `k` for the new array's length improves readability.
- **Concise Logic:** The code is simplified to focus on the core logic of removing elements.
- **Optional Printing of Updated Array:**  The code now includes the option to print the updated array, which can be helpful for verification.
