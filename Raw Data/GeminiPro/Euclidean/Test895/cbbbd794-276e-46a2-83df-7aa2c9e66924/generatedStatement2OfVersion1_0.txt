Key improvements in this code:

1. **Clarity and Readability:**  Better variable names (`k` instead of `count`), consistent spacing, and comments improve readability.

2. **Efficiency:** The code iterates through the array only once, making it more efficient.  No unnecessary array copies or manipulations.

3. **Correctness:**  The `removeElement` method directly modifies the original array in place (as the problem statement implied) and returns the correct new length.

4. **Informative Output:** The `main` method now prints both the original array and the new length, making it easier to see the effect of the `removeElement` function.  I've also added an extra test case as an example.


How it works:

The `removeElement` function uses a two-pointer approach.  The `k` pointer keeps track of the position to insert the next "valid" element (i.e., an element not equal to `val`). The `i` pointer iterates through the array.  If `nums[i]` is not equal to `val`, it's copied to `nums[k]`, and `k` is incremented.  This effectively overwrites the elements equal to `val` with the elements that should remain. Finally, `k` is returned, which represents the length of the updated array (containing only elements not equal to `val`).
