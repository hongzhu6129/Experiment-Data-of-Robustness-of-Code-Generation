**Test Cases:**

**Normal Cases:**

1. **Input:** 2
   **Expected Output:** 246

2. **Input:** 5
   **Expected Output:** 615

3. **Input:** 0
   **Expected Output:** 0

**Edge/Corner Cases:**

4. **Input:** 9  (Largest single digit)
   **Expected Output:** 1107

5. **Input:** -1 (Negative input)
   **Expected Output:** `IllegalArgumentException: Input must be a single digit non-negative integer.`

6. **Input:** 10 (Two-digit input)
   **Expected Output:** `IllegalArgumentException: Input must be a single digit non-negative integer.`


**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

* **Input Validation:** The code now includes input validation to ensure that `n` is a single-digit non-negative integer.  This prevents unexpected behavior or errors.  An `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown if the input is invalid.

* **Use of `long`:**  The calculations are now performed using `long` to handle potential overflow issues, especially when `n` is close to 9. The `nn` and `nnn` are also declared as `long`. We also cast `n` to `long` before performing the final sum to ensure the entire calculation is done with `long`.

* **Clearer Prompts and Output:**  The prompts and output messages are more informative.


**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `NNN.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac NNN.java`
3. **Run:**  Run the program with different inputs using:  `java NNN`  (The program will prompt you to enter a value for `n`).



This revised code is more robust, handles edge cases correctly, and is better structured. It's ready to be thoroughly tested with the provided test cases.
