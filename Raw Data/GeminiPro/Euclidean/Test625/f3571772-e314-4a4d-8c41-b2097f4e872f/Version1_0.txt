```java
import java.util.TreeSet;

public class TreeSetGreaterOrEqual {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage:
        TreeSet<Integer> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
        treeSet.add(10);
        treeSet.add(20);
        treeSet.add(30);
        treeSet.add(40);
        treeSet.add(50);

        int givenElement = 35;

        System.out.println("Original TreeSet: " + treeSet);
        System.out.println("Elements greater than or equal to " + givenElement + ": " + tailSet(treeSet, givenElement));


        givenElement = 20; // Example with element present in the set
        System.out.println("\nOriginal TreeSet: " + treeSet); // Show the original set again (unchanged from previous operations)
        System.out.println("Elements greater than or equal to " + givenElement + ": " + tailSet(treeSet, givenElement));

        givenElement = 60; // Example with element greater than all elements in the set

        System.out.println("\nOriginal TreeSet: " + treeSet);
        System.out.println("Elements greater than or equal to " + givenElement + ": " + tailSet(treeSet, givenElement));



    }

    public static <T> TreeSet<T> tailSet(TreeSet<T> set, T fromElement) {
        return new TreeSet<>(set.tailSet(fromElement)); // Create a copy to avoid modifying the original set
    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Generics:** The `tailSet` method now uses generics `<T>` to work with any data type that can be stored in a `TreeSet` (e.g., Integer, String, Double, etc.), making it more versatile.

2. **Copy of the TreeSet:** The `tailSet` method now creates a *copy* of the tail set using `new TreeSet<>(set.tailSet(fromElement))`. This prevents modifications to the returned set from affecting the original `TreeSet`, which is important for data integrity.

3. **Clearer Example Usage:**  The `main` method now includes multiple examples demonstrating the behavior with different `givenElement` values, including cases where the element is present in the set, greater than all elements, and in between existing elements.

4. **Output is More Informative:**  The output now clearly shows the original `TreeSet` and the resulting `tailSet` for each example, making it easier to understand the behavior.



This revised code addresses the potential issue of modifying the original `TreeSet` and provides a more robust and reusable solution.
