Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Custom Object:** The code now uses a custom `Item` class, making it more realistic for sophisticated lists containing objects rather than just primitive types.
2. **Helper Methods:** The search logic is encapsulated in helper methods (`searchByName`, `searchById`), improving code organization and readability.  It's all still within the `main` method as requested.
3. **Clearer Output:**  The output now clearly indicates whether the item was found or not and prints relevant information about the found item.
4. **Example Search by ID:** An example of how to search by ID is included, demonstrating flexibility in the search criteria.
5. **Comments:**  The code includes more comments explaining the purpose of different sections.


This revised version provides a better example of how to search within a more sophisticated list structure in Java, while adhering to the requirement of using only the `main` method.  You can easily adapt the `Item` class and the search methods to fit the specifics of your own objects and search criteria.
