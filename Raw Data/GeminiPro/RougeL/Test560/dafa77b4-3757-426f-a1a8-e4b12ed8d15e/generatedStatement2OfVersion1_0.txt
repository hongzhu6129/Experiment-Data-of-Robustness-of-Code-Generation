Explanation and key improvements:

1. **Clearer Output:** The output now explicitly states what element is being tracked and provides more informative messages.
2. **`contains()` Method:**  Demonstrates how to use the `contains()` method to efficiently check if an element exists in the ArrayList without manually iterating.
3. **`indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()`:** Shows how to find the first and last occurrences of an element using these methods.
4. **Handles "Not Found" Case:** The `trackElement` method now includes a check to print a message if the target element is not found at all in the list. This makes the output more complete and user-friendly.
5. **Combined Approach:** Using `contains()`, `indexOf()`, `lastIndexOf()` and the loop provides comprehensive examples of how to find elements.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `TrackElement.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler:
