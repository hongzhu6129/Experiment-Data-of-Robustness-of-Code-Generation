Key improvements in this code:

* **Clearer output:**  The output messages now explicitly state whether a security manager exists or not, and handle cases where environment variables are not found.
* **Cross-platform compatibility for TEMP/USERNAME:** The code checks for both common environment variable names (`TEMP` and `TMP`, `USERNAME` and `USER`) to improve compatibility across different operating systems.  This makes the code more robust.
* **Conciseness:** The code is well-formatted and avoids unnecessary complexity.
* **Correctness:**  It directly addresses the prompt's request, using the correct methods to check for a security manager (`System.getSecurityManager()`) and retrieve environment variables (`System.getenv()`).


This revised answer provides a more complete and reliable solution to the problem.
