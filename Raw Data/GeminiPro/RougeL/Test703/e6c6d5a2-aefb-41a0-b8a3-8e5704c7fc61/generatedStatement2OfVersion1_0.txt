Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The `binomial_Coefficient` method now handles cases where `k` is outside the valid range (0 to `n`) by returning 0. This prevents unexpected results or exceptions. The `main` method also checks that 'n' is non-negative.

2. **Optimization:** The code includes the optimization `k = n - k` if `k > n / 2`. This leverages the symmetry property of binomial coefficients (nCk = nC(n-k)) to reduce the number of calculations, especially for large values of `n` and `k`.

3. **Clearer Calculation:** The calculation of the binomial coefficient within the loop is made more explicit using `result = result * (n - i + 1) / i;`. This approach minimizes the risk of integer overflow by performing the multiplication before the division.

4. **User Input:** The `main` method uses a `Scanner` to take user input for `n` and `k`, making the program interactive.

5. **Informative Output:** The program provides clear output, including the values of `n` and `k` used in the calculation.


This improved version is more robust, efficient, and user-friendly. It adheres to the specified method signatures and effectively calculates binomial coefficients while handling potential errors and edge cases.
