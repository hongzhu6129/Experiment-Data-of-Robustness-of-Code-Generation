```java
public class ApproximatePi {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double piApproximation1 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0/3.0) + (1.0/5.0) - (1.0/7.0) + (1.0/9.0) - (1.0/11.0));
        double piApproximation2 = 4.0 * (1.0 - (1.0/3.0) + (1.0/5.0) - (1.0/7.0) + (1.0/9.0) - (1.0/11.0) + (1.0/13.0));


        System.out.println("Approximation 1 (up to 1/11): " + piApproximation1);
        System.out.println("Approximation 2 (up to 1/13): " + piApproximation2);

    }
}
```


**Explanation and Corrections:**

1. **Formula Correction:** The original prompt had a `+ (1/9)` where it should have been `- (1/7)`. The Leibniz formula for pi alternates signs strictly:  +, -, +, -, etc.

2. **Using Doubles:**  It's essential to use `1.0`, `3.0`, etc. (double literals) instead of integer literals (`1`, `3`).  If you use integers, Java performs integer division, which truncates the decimal part.  For example, `1/3` would evaluate to `0`, leading to an incorrect result.

3. **Clarity and Output:**  The code now clearly labels each approximation, making the output easier to understand.


This revised code now correctly implements the Leibniz formula for approximating pi up to the specified terms and produces more accurate and understandable results.
