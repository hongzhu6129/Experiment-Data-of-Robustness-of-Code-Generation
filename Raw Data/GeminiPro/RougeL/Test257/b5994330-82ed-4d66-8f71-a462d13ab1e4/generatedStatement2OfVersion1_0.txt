**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `j`.
2. **Handles Edge Cases:** Added checks for `null` or empty input arrays, which is good practice.
3. **In-Place Modification:**  Modifies the original array directly as the problem statement intends.
4. **Concise Return:** The `uniqueIndex + 1` directly returns the correct length.
5. **Improved Main Method:** The `main` method now demonstrates the function's usage with multiple example arrays, including edge cases (empty and null arrays).  It also prints only the relevant part of the modified array after duplicate removal, making the output clearer.
6. **Comments:**  Added more comments to explain the logic.


This revised version is more robust, efficient, and easier to understand.  It adheres strictly to the given method signatures while addressing potential issues and demonstrating good coding practices.
