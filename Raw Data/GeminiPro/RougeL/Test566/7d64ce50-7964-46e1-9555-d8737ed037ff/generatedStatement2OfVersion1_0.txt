Key improvements:

* **Generics:** The `compareLists` method now uses generics `<T>` so it can compare lists of any type, not just `ComplexObject`.  This makes it much more reusable.
* **Null Handling:**  The code now correctly handles cases where one or both lists are `null`.
* **Size Check:**  It efficiently checks for different list sizes before iterating.
* **Clearer equals() method:** The `equals()` method in `ComplexObject` is more robust and explains the comparison logic.
* **Example Usage:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `compareLists` method with different scenarios (different list contents, different sizes, null lists).
