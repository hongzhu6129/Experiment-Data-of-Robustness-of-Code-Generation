```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FutureInvestmentValue {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter investment amount: ");
        double investmentAmount = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter annual interest rate in percentage: ");
        double annualInterestRate = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter number of years: ");
        int numberOfYears = input.nextInt();

        double futureValue = futureInvestmentValue(investmentAmount, annualInterestRate, numberOfYears);

        System.out.printf("Future value is $%.2f\n", futureValue);
        input.close(); 
    }

    public static double futureInvestmentValue(double investmentAmount, double monthlyInterestRate, int years) {
        double monthlyInterestRateDecimal = monthlyInterestRate / 1200.0; // Convert percentage to decimal and divide by 12
        int numberOfMonths = years * 12;

        double futureValue = investmentAmount * Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRateDecimal, numberOfMonths);

        return futureValue;
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **User Input:** The `main` method now uses a `Scanner` to get input from the user for the investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years.  This makes the code more interactive and useful.

2. **Clear Prompts:** Added prompts to tell the user what kind of input is expected.

3. **Error Handling (Optional but Recommended):**  While not strictly required by the prompt, in real-world code, you would add error handling (e.g., using `try-catch` blocks) to handle invalid input (like non-numeric values or negative numbers) gracefully.

4. **Formatted Output:** The output is formatted using `printf` to display the future value with two decimal places, making it look more professional.

5. **Closing the Scanner:** Added `input.close()` to release the `Scanner` resource after use. This is good practice to prevent resource leaks.


6. **`futureInvestmentValue` Method:** This method calculates the future investment value correctly using the formula:
   ```
   futureValue = investmentAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^numberOfMonths
   ```
   It receives the annual interest rate, converts it to a monthly decimal rate, calculates the total number of months, and then applies the formula.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FutureInvestmentValue.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:
   ```bash
   javac FutureInvestmentValue.java 
   ```
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with:
   ```bash
   java FutureInvestmentValue
   ```

The program will then prompt you to enter the required values.
