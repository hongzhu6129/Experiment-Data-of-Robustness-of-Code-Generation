```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class PolynomialEvaluation {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage: -19 + 7x - 4x^2 + 6x^3 at x = 3
        List<Double> coefficients = new ArrayList<>();
        coefficients.add(-19.0); // Constant term
        coefficients.add(7.0);   // Coefficient of x
        coefficients.add(-4.0);  // Coefficient of x^2
        coefficients.add(6.0);   // Coefficient of x^3

        double x = 3.0;

        double result = polyEval(coefficients, x);
        System.out.println("Result of polynomial evaluation: " + result);
    }

    public static double polyEval(List<Double> coefficients, double x) {
        double result = 0.0;
        for (int i = coefficients.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            result = result * x + coefficients.get(i);
        }
        return result;
    }

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The provided evaluation method within `polyEval` directly implements Horner's method (also known as Horner's rule or Horner's scheme), which is the most efficient way to evaluate polynomials. It minimizes the number of multiplications required.

2. **Clarity and Comments:**  The code includes comments to explain the purpose of each part, making it easier to understand. The example usage in `main` clearly demonstrates how to use the `polyEval` method.

3. **Generality:** The code works for polynomials of any degree (including constant polynomials).  You simply provide the coefficients in the `List<Double>`.

4. **Error Handling (Optional):** While not strictly required by the prompt, consider adding error handling to `polyEval`.  For example, you could check if the `coefficients` list is null or empty:

   ```java
   public static double polyEval(List<Double> coefficients, double x) {
       if (coefficients == null || coefficients.isEmpty()) {
           // Handle the error appropriately (e.g., throw an exception, return a special value)
           return 0.0; // Or throw an IllegalArgumentException
       }
       // ... (rest of the code)
   }
   ```


**How Horner's Method Works (in the `polyEval` function):**

Let's trace the example -19 + 7x - 4x^2 + 6x^3  with x = 3:

1. **Initialization:** `result = 0.0`
2. **Loop 1 (i = 3):** `result = 0.0 * 3 + 6.0 = 6.0`
3. **Loop 2 (i = 2):** `result = 6.0 * 3 + (-4.0) = 18.0 - 4.0 = 14.0`
4. **Loop 3 (i = 1):** `result = 14.0 * 3 + 7.0 = 42.0 + 7.0 = 49.0`
5. **Loop 4 (i = 0):** `result = 49.0 * 3 + (-19.0) = 147.0 - 19.0 = 128.0`

The final result is 128.0, as expected. This demonstrates how Horner's method efficiently computes the polynomial value by accumulating the result from the innermost brackets outwards.
