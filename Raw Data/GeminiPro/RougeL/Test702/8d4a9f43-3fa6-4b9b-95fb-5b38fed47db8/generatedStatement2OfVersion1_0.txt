**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The `polyEval` method efficiently implements Horner's method for polynomial evaluation. This method minimizes the number of multiplications required, making it faster than other approaches.  It works by starting with the highest power coefficient and repeatedly multiplying and adding the next coefficient.

2. **Clearer Coefficient Handling:** The coefficients are stored in a `List<Double>`, which makes it easy to represent polynomials of any degree. The code is now more general and adaptable.

3. **Reverse Iteration:**  The `polyEval` method iterates through the coefficients from highest degree to lowest (backwards through the List).  This is crucial for Horner's method.

4. **Example in `main`:** The `main` method provides a clear example of how to use the `polyEval` method with a sample polynomial and x value.  The output is also included for verification.

5. **Comments:** The code is well-commented to explain the purpose of each part, improving readability and understanding.


This improved version is more efficient, more general, and easier to understand than previous attempts. It adheres strictly to the given method signatures and effectively demonstrates Horner's method for polynomial evaluation.
