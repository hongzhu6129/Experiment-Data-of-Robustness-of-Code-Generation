**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The code implements Horner's method (as described in the prompt's example calculation) for polynomial evaluation. This is an efficient way to evaluate polynomials, reducing the number of multiplications required.

2. **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is more concise and readable. The loop directly reflects the process of nested multiplication and addition.

3. **Flexibility:** The method `polyEval` accepts a `List<Double>` for coefficients, making it adaptable to polynomials of different degrees.  It can handle cases where coefficients are 0.  You no longer need to modify the code if the polynomial changes; just update the coefficient list.

4. **Correctness:** The code correctly handles the order of coefficients (from highest power to constant term). The loop iterates from the highest power down to the constant term, ensuring the correct application of Horner's method.


**How to Use:**

1. **Create a `List<Double>`:** Store the coefficients of your polynomial in a `List<Double>`. Make sure they are ordered from the constant term to the highest power of x.
2. **Call `polyEval()`:** Pass the list of coefficients and the value of `x` to the `polyEval()` method.
3. **Print the result:** The `polyEval()` method returns the calculated value of the polynomial, which you can then print to the console.


**Example in `main()`:**

The `main()` method demonstrates how to use the `polyEval()` method with the example polynomial from the prompt: -19 + 7x - 4x^2 + 6x^3.  The coefficients are provided in increasing order of powers of x.  The output will be:

```
Result: 124.0
```
