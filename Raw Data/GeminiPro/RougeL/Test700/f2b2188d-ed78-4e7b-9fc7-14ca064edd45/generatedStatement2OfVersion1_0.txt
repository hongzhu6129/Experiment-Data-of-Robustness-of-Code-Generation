Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`countDistinctPrimeFactors` helper method:** This method efficiently calculates the number of distinct prime factors for a given number. It optimizes by handling 2 separately and then iterating only through odd numbers up to the square root of `n`.

2. **`HashSet` for Distinct Primes:** Using a `HashSet` ensures that we only count each prime factor once.

3. **Clearer `main` method:** The `main` method now demonstrates usage with example ranges and handles the case where no numbers with distinct prime factors are found within the given range. It also provides more descriptive output.

4. **Comments and Code Style:** Added comments to explain the logic and improved code formatting for readability.



This revised code is more efficient, robust, and easier to understand.
