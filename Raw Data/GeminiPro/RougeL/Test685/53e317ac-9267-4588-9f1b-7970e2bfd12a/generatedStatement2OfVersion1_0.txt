Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Two Methods Demonstrated:**  The code now shows two common approaches for reversing an integer:
   - **Method 1 (Numerical):**  Uses a `while` loop and the modulo operator (`%`) to extract digits and build the reversed number.  This is generally more efficient for integers within the `int` range.
   - **Method 2 (String Manipulation):** Converts the integer to a String, uses `StringBuilder` to reverse it, and then parses back to an integer. This is simpler but can be less efficient, especially for large numbers, and might throw `NumberFormatException` for very large numbers that exceed the `int` or `long` range after reversal.

2. **Handling Negative Numbers:**  The code explicitly addresses how to handle negative numbers. It checks for negativity, reverses the absolute value, and then re-applies the negative sign if needed.

3. **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block in the String method to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the reversed number is too large to be an `int`.

4. **Clearer Comments:** More comments explain the logic, making it easier to understand.

5. **Example Usage:**  Provides example integers (positive and negative) to demonstrate how the methods work.



This improved version is more comprehensive, robust, and easier to understand.
