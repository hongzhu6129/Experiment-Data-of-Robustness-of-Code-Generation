Explanation:

1. **No separate method:** The code performs the reversal directly within the `main` method as requested.

2. **Basic Reversal:**
   - The `while` loop iterates through the digits of the input `num`.
   - `digit = num % 10` extracts the last digit.
   - `reversed = reversed * 10 + digit` builds the reversed number by adding the extracted digit to the end of the current reversed number.
   - `num /= 10` removes the last digit from the original number.

3. **Handling Overflow (Important Improvement):**
   - The second part of the `main` method demonstrates how to deal with potential integer overflow (which can occur if the reversed number becomes larger than the maximum value an `int` can hold).
   - `Math.addExact()` and `Math.multiplyExact()` are used. These methods throw an `ArithmeticException` if an overflow occurs.
   - The `try-catch` block catches the `ArithmeticException` and prints an error message if an overflow happens.

This improved version is more robust and handles a wider range of input values correctly.
