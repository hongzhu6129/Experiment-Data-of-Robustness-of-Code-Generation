Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:**  The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that might occur during file reading.  This is crucial for robust code.
2. **Method 1 (List and then Array):** This is generally the preferred approach.  It uses an `ArrayList` to store the lines dynamically. Since you don't know the number of lines in the file beforehand, an `ArrayList` allows you to add lines as you read them. Then, it efficiently converts the `ArrayList` to an array using `toArray(new String[0])`.
3. **Method 2 (Pre-determining Array Size - commented out):**  This method requires you to know the number of lines in the file *before* you start reading it.  This can be inefficient if you have to make an extra pass over the file just to count lines. I've left it commented out, but it's shown as an alternative if you have very strict performance requirements and absolutely need a fixed-size array from the start.
4. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly indicates which method is being used and displays the contents of the array.
5. **Helper `countLines()` function (commented out):** Demonstrates how you could count lines if you really need Method 2.
6. **File Path:** The `filePath` variable makes it easy to change the file you are reading from.  Remember to replace `"your_file.txt"` with the correct path. 
7. **Empty File Check (in commented out section):** Includes a check to handle the case where the input file is empty.  This prevents creating a zero-sized array, which could lead to issues later in your code.
