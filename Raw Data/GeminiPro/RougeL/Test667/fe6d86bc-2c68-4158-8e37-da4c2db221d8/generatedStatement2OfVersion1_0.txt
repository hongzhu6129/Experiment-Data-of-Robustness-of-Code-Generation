Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Uses `NavigableMap` and `TreeMap`:**  `TreeMap` is a good choice because it maintains keys in sorted order, making it efficient for range-based operations.  `NavigableMap` provides methods like `headMap` specifically for getting map portions.
2. **`headMap` with inclusivity control:** The `headMap(key, inclusive)` method is used to get the desired portion. The `inclusive` boolean determines whether the `givenKey` is included.
3. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly shows the given key and whether inclusivity was used.
4. **Handles Empty Maps:**  Added an example to demonstrate how the code handles empty maps gracefully (it will return an empty map).  This is important for robustness.
5. **Multiple Examples:** Added multiple examples with different keys and inclusivity settings to illustrate the different scenarios.


This improved code provides a more complete and robust solution for getting portions of a map in Java.
