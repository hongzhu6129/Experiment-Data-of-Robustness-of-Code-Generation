**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Folder Path Handling:** The code now prompts the user to enter the folder path or uses a default if no arguments are provided.  It also handles potential `NullPointerException` if `listFiles()` returns `null` (e.g., if the path is invalid).
2. **Case-Insensitive Extension Matching:** The `accept()` method now uses `toLowerCase()` on both the filename and the extensions, so it will correctly match files regardless of case (e.g., ".TXT", ".txt", ".Txt").
3. **Handles No Extensions Specified:** If the `allowedExtensions` array is empty or null, the filter now accepts all files. This makes the code more robust.
4. **Custom FilenameFilter Class:** The filter logic is encapsulated in a separate, nested class `CustomFilenameFilter` which implements the `FilenameFilter` interface. This keeps the code organized.
5. **Uses Arrays.asList for efficient checking:** The `accept` method now uses `Arrays.asList()` and `contains()` to efficiently check if the file's extension is in the allowed list. This is more readable and potentially more efficient than iterating through the array.
6. **Error Handling:** Includes a check to see if the `folder` exists and a clear message if there's an error.

**How to Use:**

1. **Replace `/path/to/your/folder`:** Change this placeholder with the actual path to the folder you want to search.
2. **Modify `extensions` array:** Change the elements in the `extensions` array to the file extensions you are interested in.
3. **Compile and Run:** Compile the Java code and run it. The program will print the absolute paths of all files in the specified folder that have the specified extensions.
