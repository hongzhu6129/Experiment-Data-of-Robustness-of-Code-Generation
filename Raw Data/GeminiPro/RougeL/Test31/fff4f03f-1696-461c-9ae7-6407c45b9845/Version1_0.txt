**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Latitude 1 | Longitude 1 | Latitude 2 | Longitude 2 | Expected Distance (approx.) | Notes                                 |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1        | 25          | 35           | 35.5        | 25.5        | 1480.08                       | Example from the problem           |
| 2        | 0          | 0           | 0          | 0           | 0                              | Same point                        |
| 3        | 90         | 0           | -90        | 0           | 20015.09                      | North Pole to South Pole             |
| 4        | 0          | 0           | 0          | 180         | 20015.09                      | Opposite sides of the equator       |
| 5        | 40.7128     | -74.0060    | 34.0522     | -118.2437   | 3935.73                       | New York to Los Angeles           |
| 6        | 0          | 90          | 0          | -90         | 20015.09                      | Halfway around the Earth on equator|
| 7        | 89.99      | 0           | 90         | 0           | 1.11                           | Very close to North Pole            |
| 8         | -89.99     | 180         | -90         | -180        | 1.11                           | Very close to South Pole, date line | // Crossing the date line
| 9 | 0 | 179.99 | 0 | -179.99 | 2.22 | Close to date line, opposite sides | // Another date line test



**Explanation of Corner Cases:**

* **Test Case 2:** Tests the scenario where both points are the same.
* **Test Case 3:** Tests the distance between the North and South Poles.
* **Test Case 4 & 6:**  Tests points on opposite sides of the Earth.
* **Test Case 7 & 8:**  Tests points very close to the poles to ensure accuracy with small distances.
* **Test Case 9**:  Tests what happens with points close to, and on opposing sides of the international dateline


**How to run the test cases (Manually):**

You would manually input the latitude and longitude values for each test case into the Java program and compare the outputted distance with the expected distance.

**Automated Testing (recommended):**

For proper testing, you should use a testing framework like JUnit. This allows you to write automated tests that verify the output of your `EarthDistance` class against the expected values for each test case.  This is much more efficient and reliable than manual testing.



This comprehensive set of test cases will help you thoroughly verify the correctness of your Java program.  Using a testing framework like JUnit is highly recommended to automate the testing process.
