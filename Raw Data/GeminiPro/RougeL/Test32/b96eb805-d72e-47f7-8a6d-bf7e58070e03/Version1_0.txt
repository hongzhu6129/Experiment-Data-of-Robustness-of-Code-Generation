```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CharacterCounter {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
        String inputString = scanner.nextLine();

        int letters = 0;

            if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
                letters++;
            } else if (Character.isWhitespace(c)) {
                spaces++;

**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Normal Input:**
   Input: `aa kiu, i swd skieo 236587.`
   Expected Output:
   ```
   Letters: 16
   Spaces: 5
   Numbers: 6
   Other characters: 2
   ```

2. **Empty String:**
   Input: `` (empty string)
   Expected Output:
   ```
   Letters: 0
   Spaces: 0
   Numbers: 0
   Other characters: 0
   ```

3. **Only Spaces:**
   Input: `     ` (five spaces)
   Expected Output:
   ```
   Letters: 0
   Spaces: 5
   Numbers: 0
   Other characters: 0
   ```

4. **Only Numbers:**
   Input: `1234567890`
   Expected Output:
   ```
   Letters: 0
   Spaces: 0
   Numbers: 10
   Other characters: 0
   ```

5. **Only Special Characters:**
   Input: `!@#$%^&*()`
   Expected Output:
   ```
   Letters: 0
   Spaces: 0
   Numbers: 0
   Other characters: 10
   ```

6. **Mixed Case with Unicode:**
   Input: `H�llo W�rld 123!`
   Expected Output:
   ```
   Letters: 10  (Note: Unicode letters are correctly counted)
   Spaces: 2
   Numbers: 3
   Other characters: 1
   ```

7. **String with Leading/Trailing Spaces:**
   Input: `   Hello World   `
   Expected Output:
   ```
   Letters: 10
   Spaces: 6
   Numbers: 0
   Other characters: 0
   ```

8. **String with Tabs and Newlines:**  (Important corner case)
   Input: `Hello\tWorld\n123`  (\t is tab, \n is newline)
   Expected Output:
   ```
   Letters: 10
   Spaces: 0       (Note: \t and \n are counted as "other")
   Numbers: 3
   Other characters: 2 
   ```


By testing with these cases, you ensure that the program correctly handles different types of input and accurately counts letters, spaces, numbers, and other characters.  The last case with tabs and newlines is particularly important because it demonstrates that whitespace characters other than just plain spaces are correctly categorized as "other."
