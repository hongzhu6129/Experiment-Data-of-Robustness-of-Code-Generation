**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **`java.time` API:** The code uses the modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8), which is significantly better than older date/time classes like `Date` and `Calendar`.
* **Clearer Formatting:** The `DateTimeFormatter` makes it very easy to specify the desired output format.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:**
    * **Valid Formats:** Tests with different valid format strings.
    * **Invalid Formats:** Tests for exceptions when invalid format strings are provided (using `assertThrows`). This is crucial for robustness.
    * **Corner Case (Leap Year):** Demonstrates a test case to handle leap years. A more robust approach would involve mocking or setting the system clock (which is complex and often avoided in unit tests).  The provided example illustrates the principle.
* **Junit 5:**  Uses JUnit 5 for testing, a common and preferred testing framework in Java.


This improved version provides better date/time handling, more robust error handling, and demonstrates good testing practices.  The comments explain the key aspects.  You'll need to add the JUnit 5 library to your project to run the tests.
