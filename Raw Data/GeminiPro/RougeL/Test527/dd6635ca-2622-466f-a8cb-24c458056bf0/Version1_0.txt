```java
public class Ramanujan {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1729; // You can change this value to explore other ranges

        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            int a3 = a * a * a;
            if (a3 > n) {
                break; // Optimization: No need to continue if a^3 exceeds n
            }

            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) { // b starts from a+1 to avoid duplicates and ensure distinct pairs
                int b3 = b * b * b;
                int sum = a3 + b3;
                if (sum > n) {
                    break;  // Optimization: No need to continue if the sum exceeds n
                }

                for (int c = a + 1; c <= n; c++) { // Finding another pair (c,d)
                    int c3 = c * c * c;
                    if (c3 > n) {
                        break; // Optimization
                    }

                    for (int d = c + 1; d <= n; d++) { // d starts from c + 1 for distinct pairs
                        int d3 = d * d * d;
                        if (c3 + d3 > n) {
                           break; // Optimization
                        }

                        if (sum == c3 + d3 && sum <= n) {
                            if (a != c && a != d && b != c && b != d) { // Ensure pairs are different
                                System.out.println(sum + " = " + a + "^3 + " + b + "^3 = " + c + "^3 + " + d + "^3");
                                return; // Exit after finding one such number
                            }

                        }
                    }
                }
            }

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is formatted for better readability with consistent indentation and spacing.  Comments explain the logic.
2. **Optimizations:** Several `break` statements are added within the loops. This significantly improves performance by preventing unnecessary calculations when the sum or cube exceeds the target `n`.
3. **Distinct Pairs:** The inner loops for `b` and `d` start from `a + 1` and `c + 1` respectively. This ensures that we generate only distinct pairs (a, b) and (c, d), avoiding duplicates and self-pairs (like 1^3 + 1^3).
4. **Explicit Check for Different Pairs:**  The condition `if (a != c && a != d && b != c && b != d)` is added to explicitly verify that the pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are different.  This prevents cases where the same pair is found in a different order (e.g.,  (1, 12) and (12, 1)).
5. **Return after Finding a Solution:**  The `return` statement is added after the first Ramanujan number is found. This is the most common requirement of the problem (find *any* such number). If you want to find *all* such numbers within the range, remove the `return` statement.
6. **Parameterizable `n`:** The upper limit `n` is now a variable at the beginning of the `main` method, making it easy to test different ranges.



How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type: `javac Ramanujan.java`
3. **Run:**  Type: `java Ramanujan`


The output will be:

```
1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3
```
