        System.out.println(num2 + " is a happy number: " + isHappy_number(num2)); // Output: false


        // Test cases from the prompt's original example (though the example code had errors)
        System.out.println("Is 7 a happy number? " + isHappy_number(7));  // Output: true

Explanation:

1. **`isHappy_number(int n)` function:**
   - Takes an integer `n` as input.
   - Uses a `HashSet` called `seen` to keep track of numbers encountered during the process. This helps detect cycles (unhappy numbers).
   - Enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `n` is not equal to 1 and `n` has not been seen before.
   - Inside the loop:
     - Adds the current `n` to the `seen` set.
     - Calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of `n`.
     - Updates `n` to the calculated sum.
   - After the loop, returns `true` if `n` is 1 (happy number), and `false` otherwise (unhappy number).

2. **`main` function:**
   - Provides example usage of the `isHappy_number` function with a few test cases.



Key improvements over alternative approaches:

- **Cycle Detection:** The use of a `HashSet` (or `Set` in general) is crucial for efficiently detecting cycles.  Without it, the code would enter an infinite loop for unhappy numbers.
- **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is structured clearly with meaningful variable names, making it easy to understand the logic.
- **Correctness:** The logic accurately implements the happy number algorithm.  The original example code in the prompt had some errors, which are corrected here.
