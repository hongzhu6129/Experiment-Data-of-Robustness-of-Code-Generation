```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class RoundFloat {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a float number: ");
        float num = scanner.nextFloat();

        float roundedNum = round_num(num);

        System.out.println("Rounded number: " + roundedNum);
        scanner.close(); 
    }

    public static float round_num(float num) {
        return Math.round(num);
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **`main` Method:**
   - The `main` method is the entry point of our Java program.  
   - It uses a `Scanner` to get float input from the user.
   - It calls the `round_num` method to perform the rounding.
   - Finally, it prints the rounded result.  It's crucial to close the `Scanner` using `scanner.close()` to release system resources.

2. **`round_num` Method:**
   - This method takes a `float` as input.
   - It uses `Math.round(num)` to round the float to the nearest integer.  `Math.round()` returns an `int`, which is then implicitly cast back to a `float`.
   - The rounded `float` value is returned.

3. **Rounding in Java:**
   - `Math.round()` follows standard rounding rules: If the fractional part is 0.5 or greater, it rounds up. Otherwise, it rounds down.

4. **Implicit Casting:**
   - When `Math.round()` returns an `int`, Java automatically converts it to a `float` when it's assigned to the `roundedNum` variable. This is known as implicit casting.

5. **User Input:**
   - The `Scanner` class is used to read input from the user. `scanner.nextFloat()` specifically reads a float value.

**Example Usage:**

```
Enter a float number: 3.14
Rounded number: 3.0

Enter a float number: 2.71
Rounded number: 3.0

Enter a float number: -1.5
Rounded number: -2.0 
```
