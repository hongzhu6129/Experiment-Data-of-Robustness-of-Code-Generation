Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer explanations:** Comments explain the difference between `equals()` and `==`.
* **Illustrative examples:** Demonstrates both methods with different string creation scenarios (string literals, `new String()`).
* **Emphasis on best practice:**  Highlights that `.equals()` is the preferred way to check for string content equality.
* **Null safety:** Shows how to avoid `NullPointerExceptions` when comparing strings that might be `null`.  The ternary operator `? :` provides a concise way to handle this.
