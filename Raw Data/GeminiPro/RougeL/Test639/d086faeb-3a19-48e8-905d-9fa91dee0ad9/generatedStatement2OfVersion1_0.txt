Key improvements and explanations in this code:

* **Method Clarity:**  Provides three distinct methods for converting to an array, each clearly labeled and explained.
* **Restores PriorityQueue:**  Because `toArray()` doesn't modify the original PriorityQueue, the code restores it between methods to demonstrate each approach accurately.  The iterative method consumes the queue, so restoring it is crucial for demonstrating that method too.
* **Generics:** Uses `Integer[]` for type safety and avoids unnecessary casting, except in method 2, which inherently returns an `Object[]`.
* **Efficiency:** Explains the efficiency difference between the `toArray()` methods. The first (with a pre-allocated array) is more efficient.
* **Iterative Method Explanation:**  Clearly notes that the iterative approach (using `poll()`) consumes/empties the PriorityQueue.
* **Clearer Output:** Uses `Arrays.toString()` for clean and readable output of the resulting arrays.
