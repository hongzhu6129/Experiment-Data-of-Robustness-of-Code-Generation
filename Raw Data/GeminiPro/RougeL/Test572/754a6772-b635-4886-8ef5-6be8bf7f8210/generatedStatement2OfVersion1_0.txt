This educational code provides:

- **Clear explanations:** Comments explain each step.
- **Demonstrations:** It shows how `trimToSize()` works and the effect on capacity and size.
- **Benefits and drawbacks:**  Discusses memory saving and potential reallocation costs.
- **Helper method:**  Shows how to get the capacity using reflection (for educational purposes).
- **`ArrayList.of()` (Java 19+):** Demonstrates a more modern way to create ArrayLists with precisely the required capacity, avoiding the need for later trimming.


This revised answer addresses the previous issues and follows the `public static void main(String[])` requirement.  It provides a more complete and instructive example of trimming ArrayList capacity.
