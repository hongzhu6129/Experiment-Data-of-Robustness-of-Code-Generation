Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles decimals and negative numbers:** The regular expression `-?\\d+(\\.\\d+)?` correctly identifies and extracts both integer and floating-point numbers, including negative values.
- **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block now handles potential `NumberFormatException` errors that might occur if a matched substring cannot be parsed as a number (e.g., if it's too large). This makes the code more robust.
- **Clearer Comments:**  Added more comments to explain the logic, especially the regular expression.
- **More Comprehensive Tests:**  The `main` method includes more test cases to demonstrate the handling of different input scenarios (decimals, negative numbers, no numbers).


This improved code provides a more complete and reliable solution to the problem of summing numbers within a string.
