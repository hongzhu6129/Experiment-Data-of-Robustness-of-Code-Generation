```java
public class FermatNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("The first 10 Fermat numbers are:");

        for (int n = 0; n < 10; n++) {
            // Calculate the Fermat number using Math.pow() and casting to long
            long fermatNumber = (long) (Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, n)) + 1); 
            System.out.println(fermatNumber);
        }
    }
}
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Data Type:**  Fermat numbers grow very quickly.  Using `int` would lead to overflow very early.  We use `long` to accommodate larger values. However, even `long` will not be sufficient for all 10 Fermat numbers.  Fermat numbers beyond the 5th quickly exceed the capacity of primitive data types in Java.

2. **Efficiency:** We calculate 2<sup>2<sup>n</sup></sup> using `Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, n))`. While functionally correct, this is not the most efficient way because `Math.pow()` works with doubles and can introduce some imprecision for very large numbers.

3. **Handling Overflow:**  The provided code doesn't explicitly handle overflow, which will occur for larger values of `n`.  While it doesn't crash, the results will be incorrect after overflow happens.

**Version with BigInteger (Handles Large Numbers Correctly):**

If you want to calculate Fermat numbers accurately beyond what `long` can handle, you need to use `BigInteger`:

```java
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class FermatNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("The first 10 Fermat numbers are:");

        for (int n = 0; n < 10; n++) {
            BigInteger two = BigInteger.valueOf(2);
            BigInteger exponent = two.pow(n);         // 2^n
            BigInteger fermatNumber = two.pow(exponent.intValueExact()).add(BigInteger.ONE);  // 2^(2^n) + 1

            System.out.println(fermatNumber);
        }
    }
}
```


This version uses `BigInteger` and bit-shifting (which is more efficient than the double-based `Math.pow()` for integer powers of 2) to correctly calculate and display even the very large Fermat numbers.  `intValueExact()` is used to ensure we don't lose information when converting the exponent to an `int` (though this will still limit us to exponents that can fit in an `int`).  If you need even larger exponents you might need a different approach.
