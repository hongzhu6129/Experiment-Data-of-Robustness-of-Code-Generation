```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ProductOfTwoNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        long num1 = scanner.nextLong(); // Using long to handle larger numbers

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        long num2 = scanner.nextLong();

        long product = num1 * num2;

        System.out.println("The product of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is: " + product);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input 1 | Input 2 | Expected Output | Notes                                   |

| 4        | 0       | 10      | 0              | Zero multiplied by a number           |
| 5        | 10      | 0       | 0              | A number multiplied by zero           |
| 6        | 0       | 0       | 0              | Zero multiplied by zero               |
| 7        | 2147483647  | 2  | 4294967294        | Integer overflow (positive)         |

**How to Run Test Cases:**

1. **Manual Testing:** You can run these test cases manually by entering the input values into the program and verifying the output against the expected output.

2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  A much better approach is to create automated tests using a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a simple example of how you could do this:

   ```java
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
   import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

   public class ProductOfTwoNumbersTest {

       @Test
       void testPositiveNumbers() {
           assertEquals(50, ProductOfTwoNumbers.calculateProduct(5, 10)); // Example of a JUnit test
       }

       // Add more @Test methods for other test cases

       // Helper method to make testing easier (not part of the original class)
       private static long calculateProduct(long num1, long num2) {
           return num1 * num2;
       }
   }
   ```

With JUnit, you can easily run all your test cases at once and quickly identify any issues. This is essential for ensuring the correctness of your code, especially as it becomes more complex.  You would typically put the `calculateProduct` helper function as a method *inside* the `ProductOfTwoNumbers` class itself�it's outside just to separate the example cleanly.  You also wouldn't need the `Scanner` in your production code as input would come through the `calculateProduct` method's parameters.
