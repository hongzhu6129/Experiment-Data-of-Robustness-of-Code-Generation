**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner and edge cases, to thoroughly test the program:

| Test Case | Input 1 | Input 2 | Expected Output | Purpose of Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 5 | 3 | 15 | Positive integers |
| 2 | -2 | 4 | -8 | One negative, one positive |
| 3 | -7 | -6 | 42 | Two negative integers |
| 4 | 0 | 10 | 0 | Multiplication by zero |
| 5 | 10 | 0 | 0 | Multiplication by zero |
| 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Both inputs are zero |
| 7 | 9223372036854775807 | 1 | 9223372036854775807 |  Long.MAX_VALUE * 1 (Edge case) |
| 8 | 9223372036854775807 | 2 | -2 | Long.MAX_VALUE * 2 (Overflow) |
| 9 | -9223372036854775808 | -1 | -9223372036854775808 | Long.MIN_VALUE * -1 (Edge Case) |
| 10 | -9223372036854775808 | -2 | 0 | Long.MIN_VALUE * -2 (Overflow) |
| 11 | 123456789 | 987654321 | 121932631112635269 | Large positive integers |


**How to Run Test Cases:**

1. **Manually:** You can run the program multiple times, entering each pair of input values and verifying the output against the expected output.

2. **Using a Testing Framework (Recommended):**  For more robust testing, especially as your programs become more complex, use a testing framework like JUnit. Here's a simple example of how you might use JUnit:
