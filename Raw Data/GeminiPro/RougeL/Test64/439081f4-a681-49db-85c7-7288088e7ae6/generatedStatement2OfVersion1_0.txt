Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles edge cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays and arrays with a single element.  These are important edge cases to consider for robustness.

2. **Clearer output:** The output messages are more descriptive, explaining the scenario for each case (empty, single element, or comparison result).

3. **Correct length check:** Uses `arr.length >= 2` to ensure there are *at least* two elements before trying to access `arr[0]` and `arr[arr.length - 1]`, preventing potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

4. **Maintains function use:**  The code continues to use a separate `function` as requested, keeping the comparison logic separate from the main method.  This is good practice for organization and reusability (if needed in a larger program).

5. **Concise and readable:** The code is straightforward and easy to understand, following best practices for clarity.
