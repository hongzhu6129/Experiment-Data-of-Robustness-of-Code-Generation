Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Checks for `null` or empty input strings and cases where the string length is not divisible by `n`. It prints appropriate messages instead of throwing exceptions.
* **Clearer output:**  The output now indicates which string is being split and into how many parts.
* **More comprehensive testing:** The `main` method now includes tests demonstrating the successful splitting,  cases where the string can't be evenly divided, and  `null` or empty string inputs.
* **Uses substring():**  Uses the `substring()` method for a more concise and efficient way to extract the parts of the string.
