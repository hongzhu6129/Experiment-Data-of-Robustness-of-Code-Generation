Key improvements in this code:

* **Handles Locale:** Uses `WeekFields.of(Locale.getDefault())` to correctly determine the first day of the week based on the user's locale.  Different locales have different starting days (e.g., Sunday or Monday).
* **Handles Week 53 Correctly:** Includes error handling to manage years that don't have a week 53. This prevents `DateTimeException` and provides a user-friendly message.
* **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted to clearly show the week number and the date range.
* **Uses TemporalAdjusters:** Uses `TemporalAdjusters.previousOrSame(DayOfWeek.MONDAY)` for a more concise and readable way to get the first day of the week.  It also handles edge cases correctly (e.g., if the current date is already a Monday).
* **Loop for All Weeks:** Iterates from week 1 to 53, ensuring that all possible weeks are considered.



This revised version provides a more robust and accurate solution for calculating and displaying the first and last days of each week of the year, taking into account locale and potential issues with week 53.
