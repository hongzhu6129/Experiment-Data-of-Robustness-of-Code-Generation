Key improvements and explanations:

* **Effective Swapping:**  The initial example attempted to swap using a method, but Java is pass-by-value.  The provided code now uses an array and a `swapInArray` function.  Since arrays are passed by reference (of the memory location), changes made inside the function affect the original array.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Includes positive, negative, zero, identical, and large number test cases to cover a wider range of scenarios and check for potential edge cases like integer overflow (although overflow is less likely with `int`).
* **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly labels each test case and the values of the variables after the attempted or successful swap.
* **Explanations in Comments:** Added more comments in the code to explain pass-by-value, pass-by-reference concepts, and the purpose of the different test cases.
