Key improvements in this version:

- **Case-Insensitivity:** Converts the input string to lowercase using `str.toLowerCase()` to handle "and", "And", "AND", etc. correctly.
- **Correct Counting:**  The `while` loop and the use of `indexOf` with the `fromIndex` parameter ensures that overlapping occurrences are not counted multiple times. The logic is now more robust and accurate.
- **Handles `null` and empty strings:** Includes a check at the start of `isAndTheEquality()` to handle these cases gracefully.  You can modify the return value (e.g., `return false` or `throw an exception`) depending on how you want to deal with invalid input.
- **Clearer `main()` method:**  Provides more test cases, including edge cases (null, empty string) to demonstrate the functionality. The output is also labeled for better understanding.
