        int resultB = (55 + 9) % 9;
        System.out.println(resultB); // Output: 1

        // c. 20 + -3*5 / 8  (Assuming 'h' was a typo for '+')
        int resultC = 20 + -3 * 5 / 8;
        System.out.println(resultC); // Output: 18 (integer division)


        // d. 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3

**Explanation of the calculations and output:**

* **a. `-5 + 8 * 6`**: Multiplication has higher precedence than addition, so `8 * 6` is evaluated first (48). Then, `-5 + 48` results in 43.

* **b. `(55 + 9) % 9`**: The parentheses ensure that `55 + 9` (64) is calculated first.  The modulo operator `%` gives the remainder of the division. `64 % 9` is 1 (9 goes into 64 seven times with a remainder of 1).

* **c. `20 + -3 * 5 / 8`**: Multiplication and division have the same precedence and are evaluated left-to-right.  So, `-3 * 5` is -15. Then, `-15 / 8` is -1 (because of integer division, the fractional part is discarded). Finally, `20 + -1` is 18.  If 'h' was intended to be something other than '+', please clarify.

* **d. `5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3`**:  Division, multiplication, and modulo have the same precedence and are evaluated left-to-right.  `15 / 3` is 5. Then, `5 * 2` is 10.  `8 % 3` is 2 (the remainder of 8 divided by 3). Finally, `5 + 10 - 2` results in 13.
