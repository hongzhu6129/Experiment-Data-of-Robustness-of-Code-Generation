**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles both increasing and decreasing ranges:**  The code now correctly handles cases where `ch1` is greater than `ch2`, printing characters in descending order.

2. **Clearer Output:**  Added `System.out.println()` at the end of the `print_Chars` method to separate the output of different calls, making it easier to read.

3. **Example Usages in `main`:**  Demonstrates how to call the `print_Chars` method with various inputs, including forward and backward printing.

4. **Uses `+=` and `-=`:**  The code uses `ch += n` and `ch -= n` for incrementing/decrementing the character within the loop, which is more concise than `ch = (char)(ch + n)` .

5. **Robustness (Optional - not strictly required by the prompt but good practice):**
   - You might want to add some input validation to handle edge cases or invalid input (e.g., a non-positive `n`).  This depends on the exact requirements of your task. Example:
