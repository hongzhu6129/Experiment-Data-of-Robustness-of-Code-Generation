3. **Character Encoding:** Although less of a corner case for this simple example, ensure the character encoding is correct (e.g., UTF-8) if you're using special characters in your face design in a more complex scenario.  An incorrect encoding could lead to incorrect output.


4. **Integration Tests (in a larger application):**  If `printFace()` is part of a larger system (e.g., a game UI),  you'd need integration tests to ensure it works correctly within that system.  For example, does calling `printFace()` at the right time in the game display the face as expected?


Even for a simple function, thinking about these aspects introduces you to testing methodologies that become essential in larger projects.  Automated testing, output comparison, and consideration of encoding or platform differences are fundamental to good software development practice.
