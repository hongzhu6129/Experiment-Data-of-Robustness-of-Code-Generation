        } else if (netIncome < 0) {
            System.out.println("You have a negative net income. Consider reviewing your expenses.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Your income and expenses are balanced.");

```


Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Prompts:**  More descriptive prompts guide the user on what to input.
* **Detailed Output Summary:**  A formatted summary makes the results easy to understand.
* **Net Income Analysis:**  Provides feedback based on whether the net income is positive, negative, or zero.
* **Resource Management:** Closes the `Scanner` using `input.close()` to prevent resource leaks.  This is good practice.
* **Error Handling (Basic):** Using `nextDouble()` assumes the user will input valid numbers. More robust error handling (e.g., using `try-catch` blocks) could be added if desired to handle invalid input gracefully.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `LivingExpensesCalculator.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac LivingExpensesCalculator.java`
3. **Run:**  After successful compilation, run the program using: `java LivingExpensesCalculator`

The program will then prompt you to enter your income and expense details.
