```java
public class RoundUpIntegerDivision {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numerator = 17;
        int denominator = 5;

        int result = (numerator + denominator - 1) / denominator; 

        System.out.println("Rounded up result: " + result);


        // More examples:
        demonstrateRounding(7, 3);  // Output: 3
        demonstrateRounding(10, 2); // Output: 5
        demonstrateRounding(1, 4);  // Output: 1
        demonstrateRounding(-5, 2); // Output: -2 (Rounds towards zero for negative numerator)

    }

    public static void demonstrateRounding(int numerator, int denominator) {
        int result = (numerator + denominator - 1) / denominator;
        System.out.println("Rounding " + numerator + "/" + denominator + ": " + result);
    }
}
```


**Explanation of the core logic:**

The formula `(numerator + denominator - 1) / denominator` effectively rounds up the result of integer division.  Here's why:

1. **Adding `denominator - 1`:** This ensures that even if the division is perfectly even, the result gets bumped up to the next integer if the numerator isn't a multiple of the denominator.  

2. **Integer Division `/`:** Integer division truncates any fractional part.


**Example Breakdown:**

Let's take `17 / 5`:

* Standard integer division: `17 / 5 = 3` (the remainder is discarded)

* Rounded up: `(17 + 5 - 1) / 5 = 21 / 5 = 4`

**Handling Negative Numerators:**

For negative numerators, be aware that this method rounds *towards zero*.  If you need to round "up" in the sense of away from zero (e.g., -5 / 2 should round to -3), you'll need to use a slightly different approach with `Math.ceil()`.  See the alternative solution below if this is your requirement.



**Alternative Solution using `Math.ceil()` (for rounding away from zero with negatives):**

If you need the rounding to behave differently with negative numbers (rounding away from zero), you'll need to use floating-point math and `Math.ceil()`:

```java
public class RoundUpIntegerDivision {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numerator = -5;
        int denominator = 2;

        double result = Math.ceil((double) numerator / denominator); // Cast to double for accurate division

        System.out.println("Rounded up result (away from zero): " + (int) result); // Cast back to int
    }
}
```
