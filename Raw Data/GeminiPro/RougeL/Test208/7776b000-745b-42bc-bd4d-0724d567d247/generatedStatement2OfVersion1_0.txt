Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Node Class:**  The `Node` class is defined to represent a node in the binary tree. It contains the data and pointers to the left and right children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):**
   - **Base Case:** If the `node` is `null` (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  The function recursively calculates the depth of the left and right subtrees. It then returns 1 + the maximum of the left and right depths.  This ensures we get the longest path from the root to a leaf.

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - A `BinaryTreeDepth` object is created.
   - A sample binary tree is constructed.  You can modify this to test with different tree structures.
   - `maxDepth()` is called with the root node, and the result (height/maximum depth) is printed to the console.


Key improvements over simpler solutions:

* **Handles null nodes:**  The base case `if (node == null)` correctly handles empty trees or subtrees, preventing `NullPointerExceptions`.
* **Clear recursion:** The recursive calls and the logic for choosing the maximum depth are easy to follow.
* **Standard practice:** Uses common naming conventions (e.g., `maxDepth`, `left`, `right`) and good code formatting, making it more readable.
