Explanation within `main` for clarity:

1. **Create a TreeMap:** We initialize a `TreeMap` which automatically stores keys in sorted order.
2. **Populate the TreeMap:**  We add some key-value pairs.
3. **Test Cases:** We define a few example keys (`key1`, `key2`, `key3`) to test the `getLeastKeyGreaterThanOrEqualTo` method.
4. **Call the method and print the result:**  We call our method with the `TreeMap` and the test key, then print the returned key.
5. **String Key Example:**  Shows how to use the method with a `TreeMap<String, Integer>`.  The key point is that the `getLeastKeyGreaterThanOrEqualTo` method is generic and works with any `Comparable` key type.

The core logic is in `getLeastKeyGreaterThanOrEqualTo`:

* **`treeMap.ceilingKey(key)`:** This built-in `TreeMap` method efficiently finds the least key greater than or equal to the given `key`. It returns `null` if no such key exists. This leverages the sorted nature of the `TreeMap` for optimal performance.



This revised answer directly addresses the prompt's requirement to use only the `main` method signature and provides a more robust and clear implementation.
