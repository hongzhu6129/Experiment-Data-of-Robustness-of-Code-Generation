Key improvements in this version:

1. **Handles unsorted arrays:** The `binarySearch` method now sorts the input array using `Arrays.sort(arr)` before starting the search.  This ensures that binary search works correctly even if the input isn't initially sorted.

2. **Overflow protection:** The midpoint calculation `int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;`  prevents potential integer overflow that could occur with `(low + high) / 2` if `low` and `high` were very large.

3. **Clearer output:** The `main` method now provides more informative output messages indicating whether the target element was found and its index if it was.

4. **Added test case:** The `main` method now includes a second test case demonstrating the output when the target element is *not* in the array.


This revised code provides a robust and complete solution for binary search in Java.
