```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadPlainTextFile {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Specify the path to your text file
        String filePath = "path/to/your/file.txt"; // Replace with your file's path

        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line); // Process each line (e.g., print it)
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }

    }
}
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that might occur during file reading (e.g., if the file doesn't exist).  This makes the program more robust. It prints an informative error message to the console if a problem is encountered.
2. **Resource Management (try-with-resources):** The `BufferedReader` is declared within a `try-with-resources` statement. This ensures that the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed, even if exceptions occur. This prevents resource leaks.
3. **Clearer File Path:** The `filePath` variable is used to store the path to the text file, making the code more readable and easier to modify.  **Remember to replace `"path/to/your/file.txt"` with the actual path to your file.**
4. **Line-by-Line Reading:** The `readLine()` method is used to read the file one line at a time. This is generally more efficient than reading the entire file into memory at once, especially for large files.
5. **Processing Each Line:** Inside the `while` loop, you have flexibility in how you process each `line` read from the file.  The example code prints the line to the console, but you could modify it to perform other operations like storing the lines in a list, searching for specific text, or performing data analysis.



**How to Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.java` file (e.g., `ReadPlainTextFile.java`).
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler: `javac ReadPlainTextFile.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java ReadPlainTextFile`

Make sure the text file you specify in `filePath` exists in the correct location relative to where you run the Java program.  If the file is in the same directory as the `.java` file, you can just use the file name (e.g., `"myFile.txt"`).  If it's in a different directory, provide the full or relative path.
