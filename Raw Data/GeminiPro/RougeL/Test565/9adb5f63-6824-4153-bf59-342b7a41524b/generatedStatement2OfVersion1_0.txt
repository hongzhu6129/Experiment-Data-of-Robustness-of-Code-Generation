This educational example shows three different ways to extract a portion of an `ArrayList`:

1. **`subList()`:**  This is the most concise method.  However, be very careful! `subList()` creates a *view* into the original list.  Changes to the sublist *will* change the original list.

2. **Loop and New `ArrayList`:**  This method creates a new, independent copy of the portion you extract.  Changes to this new sublist will *not* affect the original.

3. **Java Streams:** This method is also concise and efficient and creates a new independent list.  It is available from Java 8 onwards.


The example provides clear explanations and demonstrates the differences in behavior between `subList()` and creating a new `ArrayList`. The comments highlight potential pitfalls and best practices.  The `main()` method serves as a complete, runnable example for learners.
