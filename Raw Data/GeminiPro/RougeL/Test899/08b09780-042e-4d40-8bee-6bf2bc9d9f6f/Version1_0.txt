Key improvements:

* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `charCounts` is more descriptive than a single-letter name.
* **Comments:**  Explaining the logic improves readability.
* **Error Handling (sort of):** Although the problem states there will always be a unique character, returning -1 shows an awareness of potential edge cases. In a real-world scenario, you'd likely want to throw an exception if the assumption doesn't hold.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added examples in `main` to demonstrate the function's behavior with various inputs, including one where there are no unique characters to show what happens in that (not supposed to happen according to the problem) scenario.
* **Assumption Clarified:** Added a comment to explicitly mention the lowercase English alphabet assumption.  This is important for clarity and to avoid unexpected behavior with other characters.


This revised version is more robust, readable, and maintainable.  It adheres to the specified method signatures and addresses potential issues that might arise.
