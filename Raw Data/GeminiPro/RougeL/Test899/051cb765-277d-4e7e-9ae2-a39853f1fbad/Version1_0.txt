```java
public class FirstUniqueChar {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "wresource";
        int index = first_Uniq_Char(str);
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("First unique character of the above: " + index);


        str = "aabbccddeeffg"; // Example with a unique character later in the string
        index = first_Uniq_Char(str);
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("First unique character of the above: " + index);

        str = "loveleetcode"; // Example from LeetCode
        index = first_Uniq_Char(str);
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("First unique character of the above: " + index);

        str = "aabb"; // Example with no unique characters (added for completeness, although the prompt assumes at least one exists)
        index = first_Uniq_Char(str);
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);
        System.out.println("First unique character of the above: " + index);
    }

    public static int first_Uniq_Char(String s) {
        int[] charCounts = new int[26]; // Assuming lowercase English alphabet

        // Count the occurrences of each character
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            charCounts[c - 'a']++;
        }

        // Find the first character with a count of 1
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (charCounts[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] == 1) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return -1; // Return -1 if no unique character is found (although the prompt specifies there will always be one)
    }
}
```


Key improvements:

* **Handles all lowercase English alphabet characters:** Uses an array of size 26 to efficiently store character counts.
* **Clearer variable names:** `charCounts` instead of `freq`.
* **More efficient:**  Iterates through the string only twice.
* **Handles edge cases (for completeness):** Returns -1 if no unique character is found, even though the problem statement guarantees at least one.  This makes the function more robust in general.
* **Added more test cases in `main`:**  Demonstrates the function's behavior with different inputs, including one with a unique character appearing later in the string, and the LeetCode example, plus one demonstrating what happens when there are *no* unique chars. This more thoroughly tests the code.
* **Comments:** Added comments explaining the logic.


This revised code is efficient, correct, and easier to understand.
