Key improvements:

* **Case-insensitivity:** The `CountCharacters` method now converts the input string to lowercase to ensure that 'P' and 'p' are counted as the same character.
* **Clearer output:**  The output now explicitly states "Duplicate characters in..." and handles the case where there are no duplicates by printing "None." A newline has also been added for cleaner formatting.
* **Example with no duplicates:** Added `str4` to demonstrate the "None" output.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the purpose of the code sections.


This revised version addresses the issues in the previous responses and provides a more robust and clear solution to the problem.
