**Explanation of Corner Cases and Improvements:**

* **Single-Digit Restriction:**  The code now explicitly restricts input to single digits (0-9). This is important for two reasons: clarity of the problem (the original wording implies single-digit input) and to avoid potential integer overflow if larger numbers were used. The `if` condition enforces this restriction.
* **Negative Input:**  The code now handles negative single-digit input correctly by including it in the valid range in the `if` condition.
* **Input Validation:** The `try-catch` block handles `InputMismatchException`, ensuring that the program doesn't crash if the user enters non-numeric input.
* **Scanner Closure:**  The `finally` block ensures that the `Scanner` is closed even if an exception occurs. This is good practice for resource management.
* **Integer Overflow (If Restriction Removed):**  If you were to remove the single-digit restriction, you'd need to consider integer overflow. For very large values of `n`, `nnn` could exceed the maximum value that an `int` can hold.  You might use `long` to store the result or implement a check to prevent overflow.


This improved version is more robust and handles various scenarios, making it better suited for real-world use.
