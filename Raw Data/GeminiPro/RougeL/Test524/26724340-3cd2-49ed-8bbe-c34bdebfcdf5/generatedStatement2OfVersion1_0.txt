Key improvements and explanations:

* **Handles negative cubes:** The `isCube` method now correctly handles negative numbers.  We take the absolute value for the cube root calculation and then check if the cube of the potential root *matches the original sign* of the input `num`.
* **Efficiency:** The code now uses a binary search approach within `isCube`. This is significantly more efficient than a brute-force loop or using `Math.cbrt()` when dealing with larger numbers.
* **Clearer Testing:** The `testCube` helper method makes it easier to test with multiple input values.
* **User Input:** The code now takes user input from command line arguments. This makes it more interactive. It also includes error handling to ensure that the input is a valid integer. 
* **Comments and Readability:** Added comments throughout the code to explain the logic, improving readability.



This improved version is more robust, efficient, and provides better user interaction.
