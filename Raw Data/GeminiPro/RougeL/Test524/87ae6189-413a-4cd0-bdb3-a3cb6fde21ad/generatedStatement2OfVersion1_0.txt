Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Negative Cubes:** The code now correctly handles negative perfect cubes (e.g., -8, -27).  The `isCube` method takes the absolute value of the input if it's negative and checks if its cube root is an integer.  The cube root is then negated if the original number was negative.

2. **Helper Function:**  The `isCube` function makes the code more modular and reusable.

3. **Clearer Logic:** The logic in `isCube` is simplified and easier to understand.  

4. **Optional `checkCube` function:** This function is included to provide a more concise way to print the results of the cube check for multiple test cases in `main`. It's not strictly necessary, but it improves code readability.

5. **Test Cases:** I've included a few extra test cases within `main` to demonstrate the code's behavior with different inputs (positive, negative, zero).  You would typically read the input number from the user, but I've hardcoded them for this demonstration.

6. **Comments:** The code has comments explaining the important parts.
