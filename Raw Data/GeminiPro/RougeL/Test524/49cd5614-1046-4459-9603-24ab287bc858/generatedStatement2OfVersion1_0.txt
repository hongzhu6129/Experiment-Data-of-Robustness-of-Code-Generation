Key improvements:

* **Handles negative numbers:** The `isCube` method now correctly handles negative input values, as the cube of a negative number is also negative.
* **More efficient cube root check:** The code uses `Math.cbrt()` to calculate the cube root, which is more efficient and accurate than a loop-based approach, especially for larger numbers.
* **Rounding for precision:**  The cube root calculation can sometimes result in very small floating-point errors.  The `Math.round()` function addresses this by rounding the cube root to the nearest integer before checking if its cube equals the original number. This ensures accurate results for perfect cubes.
* **User Input Example:** Includes an example demonstrating how to take user input and gracefully handle invalid input (non-integer values) using a `Scanner` and `hasNextInt()`.
* **Resource Management:**  The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` after it's no longer needed to release system resources.  This is good practice, especially in larger applications.
* **Clearer comments and structure:** Improved comments and code structure enhance readability and maintainability.


This improved version is more robust, efficient, and handles a wider range of inputs correctly.
