```java
public class CubeChecker {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Input data (hardcoded for this example based on prompt)
        int number = 8;

        if (isCube(number)) {
            System.out.println("Number is a cube.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number is not a cube.");
        }


        // Example with user input (requires exception handling)
         java.util.Scanner scanner = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
         System.out.print("Input a number: ");

         if (scanner.hasNextInt()) {
             int userNum = scanner.nextInt();
             if (isCube(userNum)) {
                 System.out.println("Number is a cube.");
             } else {
                 System.out.println("Number is not a cube.");
             }
         } else {
             System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.");
         }
         scanner.close();
    }




    private static boolean isCube(int num) {
        // Handle negative numbers (their cubes are also negative)
        if (num < 0) {
            return isCube(-num); // Check the absolute value
        }

        // Efficiently check for cube using cbrt (cube root)
        double cubeRoot = Math.cbrt(num);
        return Math.round(cubeRoot) * Math.round(cubeRoot) * Math.round(cubeRoot) == num;
    }
}
```


Key improvements:

* **Handles negative numbers:** The `isCube` method now correctly handles negative input values, as the cube of a negative number is also negative.
* **More efficient cube root check:** The code uses `Math.cbrt()` to calculate the cube root, which is more efficient and accurate than a loop-based approach, especially for larger numbers.
* **Rounding for precision:**  The cube root calculation can sometimes result in very small floating-point errors.  The `Math.round()` function addresses this by rounding the cube root to the nearest integer before checking if its cube equals the original number. This ensures accurate results for perfect cubes.
* **User Input Example:** Includes an example demonstrating how to take user input and gracefully handle invalid input (non-integer values) using a `Scanner` and `hasNextInt()`.
* **Resource Management:**  The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` after it's no longer needed to release system resources.  This is good practice, especially in larger applications.
* **Clearer comments and structure:** Improved comments and code structure enhance readability and maintainability.


This improved version is more robust, efficient, and handles a wider range of inputs correctly.
