```java
public class CubeChecker {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Input data (hardcoded for this example, ideally would be read from user input)
        int number = 8;

        // Check if the number is a perfect cube
        if (isPerfectCube(number)) {
            System.out.println("Number is a cube.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number is not a cube."); 
        }
    }

    private static boolean isPerfectCube(int num) {
        // Handle negative numbers (cube root of a negative number is negative)
        if (num < 0) {
           return isPerfectCube(-num); // Check the absolute value
        }

        // Efficiently check for perfect cube using Math.cbrt (cube root) and casting
        double cubeRoot = Math.cbrt(num);
        return (int) cubeRoot == cubeRoot; // Check if cube root is an integer
    }
}
```


Explanation and Improvements:

1. **`isPerfectCube` Method:** A separate helper method `isPerfectCube` is created to encapsulate the cube-checking logic.  This makes the `main` method cleaner and more readable.

2. **Handling Negative Numbers:** The `isPerfectCube` method now correctly handles negative numbers.  The cube of a negative number is negative, so we just need to check the cube of the absolute value.

3. **Efficient Cube Root Calculation:** The code uses `Math.cbrt()` to calculate the cube root. This is more efficient than iterating or using `Math.pow()` with a fractional exponent.

4. **Integer Check:** The result of `Math.cbrt()` is a `double`.  We cast the cube root to an `int` and then compare it to the original `double` value. If they are equal, it means the cube root was a whole number (an integer), and therefore the original number is a perfect cube.

5. **Clearer Output:** The output message is more informative, stating whether the number "is" or "is not" a cube.

6. **Input (Ideally):**  In a real application, you wouldn't hardcode the input.  You would use the `Scanner` class to read the number from the user.  For example:

   ```java
   import java.util.Scanner;
   // ... rest of the code

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
       System.out.print("Input a number: ");
       int number = scanner.nextInt();

       // ... (rest of the code to check and print the result)
   }
   ```
