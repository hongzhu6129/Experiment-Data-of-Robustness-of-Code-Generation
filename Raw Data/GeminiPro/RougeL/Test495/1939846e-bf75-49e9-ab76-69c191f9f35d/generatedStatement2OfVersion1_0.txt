**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Method Signature:**  The `printMatrix` method now takes an integer `n` as input, specifying the size of the n-by-n matrix.

2. **Nested Loops for Matrix Traversal:** The code uses nested `for` loops to iterate through each row and column of the matrix (from 0 to n-1).

3. **Border vs. Inside Logic:** The `if` condition checks if the current cell is on the border of the matrix (first/last row or first/last column).  If it is, it prints "1 ". Otherwise (if the cell is inside the matrix), it prints "0 ". This creates the desired image effect.

4. **Newlines for Formatting:**  `System.out.println()` is used after each row to ensure the output is formatted correctly as a matrix.
