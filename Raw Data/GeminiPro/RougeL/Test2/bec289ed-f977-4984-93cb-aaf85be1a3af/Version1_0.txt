```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
        double num1 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
        double num2 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Sum: " + (num1 + num2));
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (num1 - num2));
        System.out.println("Product: " + (num1 * num2));

        if (num2 != 0) {  // Check for division by zero
            System.out.println("Quotient: " + (num1 / num2));
            System.out.println("Remainder: " + (num1 % num2));
        } else {
            System.out.println("Division by zero is not allowed.");
        }


        input.close(); // Close the scanner
    }
}

**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -5 | -2 | -7 | -3 | 10 | 2.5 | -1.0 or 1.0 (remainder behavior can vary with negatives) |
| 3. Zero and Positive | 0 | 8 | 8 | -8 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4. Positive and Zero | 12 | 0 | 12 | 12 | 0 | "Division by zero" | "Division by zero"|
| 5. Zero and Zero | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | "Division by zero" | "Division by zero" |
| 6. Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000 | 2 | 0 |
| 7. Decimal Numbers | 5.5 | 2.5 | 8 | 3 | 13.75 | 2.2 | 0 |
| 8. Negative and Positive | -10 | 5 | -5 | -15 | -50 | -2 | 0|
| 9. Positive and Negative | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2 | 0|
| 10. Integer Overflow (Potential) | Integer.MAX_VALUE | 1 | Overflow Result (handled by Java) | Overflow Result | Overflow Result |  Overflow Result | Overflow Result |



**Explanation of Corner Cases:**

* **Division by Zero (Test Cases 4 and 5):** Dividing by zero is undefined in mathematics. The program explicitly checks for this condition and prints an appropriate message.
* **Zero Operations (Test Cases 3, 4, and 5):**  Involving zero in operations can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not handled correctly. These test cases ensure that operations with zero produce the correct output.
* **Large Numbers (Test Case 6):**  Using large numbers helps test potential overflow issues, although Java handles integer overflow gracefully (it wraps around).
* **Decimal Numbers (Test Case 7):** Using floating-point numbers helps ensure that the program handles decimal arithmetic correctly.
* **Negative Numbers (Test Cases 2, 8 and 9):**  Operations with negative numbers need to be tested to ensure correct sign handling. The remainder operation's behavior with negative numbers can be a bit subtle, so it's important to test this.
* **Integer Overflow (Test Case 10):** Although Java handles integer overflow by wrapping around, it's still a good practice to test with extremely large values to see how the program behaves.


This comprehensive set of test cases helps verify the correctness and robustness of the `ArithmeticOperations` program.  You should run your Java code with these inputs and compare the actual output with the expected output to ensure that your program is working as intended.
