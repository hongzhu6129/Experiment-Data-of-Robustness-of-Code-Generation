   If `diff` returns nothing, the files are identical.  Otherwise, it will highlight the differences.  `expected_output.txt` would contain the exactly formatted poem.



**Corner Cases:**

This program has no real corner cases in the traditional sense (no input to validate or edge conditions to handle). However, here are a few things you might consider for more complex output formatting scenarios:

* **Unicode Characters:**  If the poem contained Unicode characters (e.g., accented letters, emojis), ensure they are printed correctly.  This might involve using a specific character encoding.
* **Very Long Lines:**  If the lines of the poem were extremely long, you might need to consider word wrapping or other formatting adjustments.
* **Different Output Streams:**  You could test printing to different output streams (e.g., `System.err` or a file) if that were a requirement of a more complex program using similar formatting techniques.


This revised answer provides a more complete testing strategy, acknowledging the simplicity of the current program while also suggesting more advanced techniques that would be relevant to similar but more complex output formatting tasks.
