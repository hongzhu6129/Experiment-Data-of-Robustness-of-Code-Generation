```java
public class DivideTwoNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int numerator = 50;
        int denominator = 3;

        if (denominator == 0) {
            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero.");
        } else {
            int result = numerator / denominator; // Integer division
            System.out.println(numerator + "/" + denominator + ": " + result);


            // For a more precise result (with decimals), use double or float:
             double doubleResult = (double) numerator / denominator;
             System.out.println(numerator + "/" + denominator + " (with decimals): " + doubleResult);

             //Illustrating Remainders (Modulo Operator)
             int remainder = numerator % denominator;
             System.out.println("Remainder of " + numerator + "/" + denominator + ": " + remainder);
             

        }
    }
}
```


Explanation and Educational Points:

1. **Integer Division:**  When you divide two integers (like `int numerator = 50;` and `int denominator = 3;`), Java performs *integer division*. This means any fractional part of the result is discarded. That's why `50 / 3` results in `16`, not `16.666...`.

2. **Floating-Point Division:** To get a result with decimals, you need to use floating-point data types like `double` or `float`.  Casting one of the operands to `double` (as shown in the example with `(double) numerator`) is enough to force floating-point division.

3. **Division by Zero:**  Dividing by zero is mathematically undefined and will cause a `ArithmeticException` in Java.  The code includes a check (`if (denominator == 0)`) to handle this potential error and prevent the program from crashing.

4. **Remainders (Modulo Operator):** The modulo operator `%` gives you the remainder of a division.  For example, `50 % 3` is `2` because 3 goes into 50 sixteen times with a remainder of 2.

5. **Outputting Results:** The `System.out.println()` method is used to display information on the console.  The `+` operator is used to concatenate (join) strings and numbers for clear output.


How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as a file named `DivideTwoNumbers.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type `javac DivideTwoNumbers.java`.  This creates a `DivideTwoNumbers.class` file.
3. **Run:** Type `java DivideTwoNumbers` in the terminal to execute the program. You'll see the output printed on the screen.


This improved example is more educational, demonstrating different aspects of division in Java and including good error-handling practices.
