Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clarity and Structure:** The code is organized into sections for the star part, the stripes, and the bottom stripes, making it easier to understand and modify.
* **Looping for Repetition:**  `for` loops are used effectively to repeat patterns instead of writing out each line individually.  This makes the code more concise and less error-prone.
* **Corrected "pct" anomaly:** While the "pct" seemed out of place, I've incorporated it into the code as specified in the prompt. If this was a typo and you intended a regular star row, you can simply remove the "pct " and adjust the loop counter accordingly.
* **Spacing and Alignment:** The code now prints the flag with the correct spacing between the stars and stripes, matching the desired output much more closely.


To compile and run this code:

1. Save the code as `AmericanFlag.java`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Compile: `javac AmericanFlag.java`
5. Run: `java AmericanFlag`


This will print the American flag pattern to your console. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or further improvements!
