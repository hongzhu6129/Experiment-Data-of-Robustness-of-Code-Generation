This improved version handles these points:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is now more straightforward and easier to understand.
* **Conciseness:** The logic is expressed more compactly.
* **Error Handling (for command-line input):**  The code includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters non-numeric input on the command line.  This makes the program more robust.
* **Command-Line Input:** The program now accepts the year as a command-line argument, making it more flexible. You can run it like this: `java LeapYearChecker 2023`



Explanation of the Leap Year Logic:

1. **Divisible by 4:**  A leap year is usually divisible by 4.
2. **Century Years (Divisible by 100):** However, if a year is divisible by 100, it is NOT a leap year...
3. **Exception for Years Divisible by 400:** ...UNLESS it is also divisible by 400.  So, years like 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years.
