**Test cases**

* **Normal case:** Input string: "Hello world", character to search for: 'o'
    * Expected output: "The character was found at index 4."
* **Character not found:** Input string: "Hello world", character to search for: 'z'
    * Expected output: "The character was not found in the string."
* **Empty string:** Input string: "", character to search for: 'a'
    * Expected output: "The character was not found in the string."
* **Character at the beginning of the string:** Input string: "apple", character to search for: 'a'
    * Expected output: "The character was found at index 0."
* **Character at the end of the string:** Input string: "banana", character to search for: 'a'
    * Expected output: "The character was found at index 5."
* **Character appears multiple times:** Input string: "Mississippi", character to search for: 's'
    * Expected output: "The character was found at index 0."
* **Character is case-sensitive:** Input string: "Hello world", character to search for: 'O'
    * Expected output: "The character was not found in the string."
