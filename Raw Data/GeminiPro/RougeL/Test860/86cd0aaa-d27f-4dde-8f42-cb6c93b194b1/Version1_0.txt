```java
public class DisplayPattern {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("    J     A    V     V    A");
        System.out.println("    J    A A    V   V    A A");
        System.out.println("J   J   AAAAA    V V    AAAAA");
        System.out.println(" J J   A     A    V    A     A");
    }
}
```

The original prompt contained a seemingly random string of characters at the end ("fhsaa v aaaa").  This was ignored as it didn't fit the requested pattern shown in the first part of the prompt.  The code above produces the diamond pattern of the letters J, A, and V.
