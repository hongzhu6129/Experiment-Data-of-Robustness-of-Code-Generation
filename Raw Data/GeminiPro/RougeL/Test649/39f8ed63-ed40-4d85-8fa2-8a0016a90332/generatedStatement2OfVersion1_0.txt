Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Clearer Visualization:** The original prompt was vague about what "visualization" meant.  This code now provides a simple visualization by printing the *keys* that are associated with the target value if it's found.  You can adapt this visualization part to suit your specific needs (e.g., a chart, a graph, etc. if you're using a GUI library).

2. **HashMap:** Uses a `HashMap` for the map, which is a common and efficient implementation.

3. **Example with No Match:** Added a second example where the value is *not* found to demonstrate that part of the logic.

4. **Clear Output:** Prints informative messages to the console indicating whether the value was found or not.


How to further improve Visualization (beyond the scope of a simple `main` method):

* **GUI Libraries:**  If you need more sophisticated visualizations (charts, graphs), consider using Java GUI libraries like Swing, JavaFX, or processing libraries.
* **External Tools:** You could output your data in a format suitable for visualization with external tools (e.g., CSV for spreadsheets or libraries like gnuplot/matplotlib).
* **Specialized Visualization Libraries:**  Libraries like JFreeChart or XChart are specifically designed for creating charts and graphs in Java.
