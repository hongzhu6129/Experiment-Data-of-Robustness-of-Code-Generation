Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly adheres to the specified `main` and `Saddleback` method signatures.

2. **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function with a sample matrix and target value, and it handles the case where the target is not found.  I've added a second example to illustrate this.

3. **Return an `int[]`:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int` array of size 2, containing the row and column indices of the target. If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`. This is a standard and convenient way to return multiple values.

4. **Saddleback Search Algorithm:**  The core logic of the saddleback (or staircase) search is implemented correctly.  It starts at the top-right corner and efficiently eliminates either a row or a column in each step.


5. **Comments and Readability:**  The code is well-commented to explain the logic and improve readability.
