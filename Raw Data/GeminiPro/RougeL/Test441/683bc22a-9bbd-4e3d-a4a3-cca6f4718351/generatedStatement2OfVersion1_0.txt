**Explanation:**

1. **Get Current Calendar Instance:** We create a `GregorianCalendar` object to represent the current date and time.

2. **Calculate Previous Date:**  We use `calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, -1)` to subtract one day from the current date, effectively getting the previous day.

3. **Get Minimum Values:** We use `calendar.getActualMinimum(field)` to get the minimum possible value for each field (YEAR, MONTH, WEEK_OF_YEAR, DAY_OF_MONTH). This represents the lowest possible value the calendar field can have, not the value of the previous day.

4. **Print Results:** The minimum values are printed to the console.

5. **Previous Day's Values (For Comparison):**  The code also demonstrates how to get the actual *values* for the previous day (year, month, week, day) so you can compare them to the minimums.  It's important to understand that the minimums are *not* necessarily the same as the previous day's values.  The minimum for day of month will always be 1, the minimum for month will always be 0 (January).


**Important Note about Week of Year:**  Be careful when interpreting `WEEK_OF_YEAR`. It's calculated based on the locale and calendar rules.  A week might start on Sunday or Monday depending on the locale, and the first week of the year might be partial. The minimum value for `WEEK_OF_YEAR` is often 1, but its actual interpretation depends on these factors.
