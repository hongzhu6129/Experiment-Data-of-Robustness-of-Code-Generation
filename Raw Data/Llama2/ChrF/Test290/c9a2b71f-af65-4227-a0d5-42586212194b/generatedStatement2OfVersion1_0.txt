Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using names like `makefactorial` and `calcuLexicoRank` (though not ideal) are at least closer to being descriptive compared to previous versions.

2. **ASCII Character Handling:** Using `count[256]` handles ASCII characters correctly.

3. **Cumulative Count Logic:** The cumulative count logic is now correctly implemented to handle duplicates properly.

4. **Correct Factorial Calculation:** The factorial calculation is fixed.


5. **More Comprehensive Testing:**  The `main` method now includes examples with different string lengths, duplicate characters, and all uppercase letters to ensure the solution handles various cases correctly, especially edge cases.



This improved version is far more robust and accurate in calculating lexicographic rank.  It also follows the requested method signature constraints.  While method names could be further improved (e.g., `calculateFactorial`, `calculateLexicographicRank`), the core logic is sound.
