Explanation of Improvements:

1. **Use of TreeMap:**  A `TreeMap` is the most suitable data structure for this problem. It automatically stores keys in sorted order, which is essential for efficiently finding the least key greater than or equal to a given key.

2. **ceilingKey() Method:** The `ceilingKey()` method of the `TreeMap` directly provides the desired functionality. It returns the least key greater than or equal to the given key, or `null` if no such key exists.

3. **Clearer Examples:** The provided examples demonstrate the behavior of `ceilingKey()` with various scenarios, including keys greater than, less than, and equal to existing keys in the map.

4. **Handling Null:** The code explicitly checks if `ceilingKey()` returns `null` to avoid `NullPointerExceptions` and provide informative output when no suitable key is found.

5. **Generics:** The examples now use generics (`TreeMap<Integer, String>`, `TreeMap<String, Double>`) to show how the code can be used with different data types for keys and values.


This revised version is more efficient, concise, and demonstrates good Java coding practices. It leverages the built-in functionality of the `TreeMap` to solve the problem directly.
