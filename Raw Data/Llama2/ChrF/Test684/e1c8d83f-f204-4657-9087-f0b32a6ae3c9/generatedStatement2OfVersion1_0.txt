**Explanation and How to Use:**

1. **Replace `path/to/your/file.txt`:**  Change this placeholder to the *actual* path of the text file you want to read on your system.  For example:
   -  `"C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\my_text_file.txt"` (Windows)
   -  `/home/yourname/documents/my_text_file.txt` (Linux/macOS)
2. **Compile and Run:** Compile the Java code (e.g., `javac ReadPlainTextFile.java`) and then run it (e.g., `java ReadPlainTextFile`).
3. **Output:** The program will print the contents of the text file to the console, line by line.
4. **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles potential `IOExceptions` that can occur if the file is not found or if there are other problems accessing it.  It prints an error message if an exception occurs.
5. **Try-with-resources:** The `try (BufferedReader reader = ...)` syntax ensures that the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed even if an exception is thrown, preventing resource leaks.
