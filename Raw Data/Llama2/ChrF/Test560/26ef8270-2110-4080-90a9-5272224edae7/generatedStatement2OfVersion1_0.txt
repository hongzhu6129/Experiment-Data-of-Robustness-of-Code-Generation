**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Output Formatting:**  The code formats the output to clearly show the time zone ID and its offset from UTC, such as `America/New_York : UTC-05:00`.  The formatting makes it easy to read and understand.

2. **Handles All Time Zones:** The `TimeZone.getAvailableIDs()` method returns *all* available time zone IDs recognized by Java. 

3. **UTC/GMT Consistency:**  The code uses `getRawOffset()` which provides the *raw* offset without considering Daylight Saving Time (DST). This gives a consistent UTC offset. This is generally preferred when listing all time zones as DST can change throughout the year.  If you needed to account for DST, you could use `getOffset(long date)` with the current time.


4. **Sorting:** The `Arrays.sort(availableIDs)` line sorts the time zone IDs alphabetically, which can make it easier to find a specific time zone in a long list. This is optional but helpful.

5. **Error Handling (Optional):**  While very unlikely, you could add error handling in case a time zone ID is invalid (though `TimeZone.getTimeZone()` is robust and usually handles invalid IDs gracefully).


**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `TimeZones.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it:
