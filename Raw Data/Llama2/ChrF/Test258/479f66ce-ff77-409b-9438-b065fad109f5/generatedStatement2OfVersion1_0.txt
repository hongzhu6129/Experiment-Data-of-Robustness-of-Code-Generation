**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **Operator Precedence:** Java follows standard operator precedence (order of operations).  Multiplication, division, and modulo (%) have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.  
   - In expression `a`, multiplication happens before addition.
   - In expression `c`, multiplication and division (having equal precedence) are evaluated from left to right before addition.
   - In expression `d`, division, multiplication, and modulo are done before addition and subtraction.

2. **Integer Division:**  When dividing integers in Java, the result is also an integer.  Any fractional part is truncated (discarded).  This is why `-3 * 5 / 8` evaluates to -1 (not -1.875).

3. **Modulo Operator (%):** The modulo operator gives the remainder of a division. `8 % 3` is 2 (because 8 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2).

4. **Parentheses:** You can use parentheses to control the order of operations.  In expression `b`, the parentheses ensure that the addition is done before the modulo operation.

5. **Printing Results:**  `System.out.println()` is used to display the results to the console.  Concatenating the string explanation with the integer result using the `+` operator makes the output clear.


This example demonstrates basic arithmetic operations in Java and highlights important concepts like operator precedence and integer division.  It's a good starting point for learning how to work with numbers in Java.
