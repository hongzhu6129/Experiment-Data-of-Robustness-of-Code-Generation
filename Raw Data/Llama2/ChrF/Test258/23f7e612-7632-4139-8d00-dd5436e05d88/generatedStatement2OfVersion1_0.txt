**Explanation of the Calculations and Integer Division:**

* **Integer Division:** In Java, when you divide two integers (like `-15 / 8`), the result is also an integer.  The fractional part is truncated (discarded), not rounded. So, `-15 / 8` results in `-1`.

* **Calculation c:**
   - `-3 * 5 = -15`
   - `-15 / 8 = -1` (integer division)
   - `20 + -1 = 19`

* **Calculation d:**  Follows standard order of operations (multiplication, division, modulo from left to right, then addition and subtraction from left to right).
   - `15 / 3 = 5`
   - `5 * 2 = 10`
   - `8 % 3 = 2`
   - `5 + 10 - 2 = 13`


**Key Points for Educational Purposes:**

1. **Operator Precedence:** Java follows standard operator precedence (PEMDAS/BODMAS - Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, and Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

2. **Integer Division:**  Emphasize the difference between integer division and floating-point division.  If you want a floating-point result, make at least one of the operands a floating-point number (e.g., `15.0 / 3`).

3. **Modulo Operator:**  The modulo operator (`%`) gives the remainder of a division.


This improved explanation clarifies the integer division aspect, which is crucial for understanding why the results are as they are.  It also highlights important concepts like operator precedence.
