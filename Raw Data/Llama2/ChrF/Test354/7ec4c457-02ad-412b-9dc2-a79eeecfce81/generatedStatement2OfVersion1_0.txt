Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes `try-catch` blocks to handle potential `NumberFormatException` errors. This is crucial because if the input string cannot be parsed into the desired numeric type, the program would crash without error handling. The `try-catch` prevents this and provides informative error messages.
* **Clearer Output:**  The output now clearly labels each converted value (e.g., "Integer:", "Float:", etc.), making it easier to understand the results.
* **Example with Invalid Input:** An example with an invalid input string (`"123a45"`) is included to demonstrate how the error handling works.  This shows the user what happens when the conversion fails.
* **Comments:**  Comments are added to explain the different parts of the code, making it more readable and maintainable.





This revised version addresses the potential problems and provides a more robust and user-friendly solution.
