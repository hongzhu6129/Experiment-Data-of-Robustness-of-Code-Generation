Key improvements:

* **Correct Star Pattern:**  Handles the alternating 6-star and 5-star rows correctly.
* **Clearer Formatting:** Uses nested loops to make the code structure more readable and easier to understand.
* **Consistent Spacing:** Ensures proper spacing between stars and stripes using `System.out.print(" ");`
* **Added "pct":** Includes the "pct" as requested in the middle.
* **Correct Stripes Section:** Prints the solid stripes section accurately.


This improved version provides a much more accurate representation of the American flag with the requested "pct" addition.
