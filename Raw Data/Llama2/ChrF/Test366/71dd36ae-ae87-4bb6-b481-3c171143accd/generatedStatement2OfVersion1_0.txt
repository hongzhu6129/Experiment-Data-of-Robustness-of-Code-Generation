This improved version provides:

* **Correct Star Pattern:**  The stars are now arranged in the staggered pattern of the US flag's canton.
* **Correct Proportions:**  The canton and stripes have more realistic proportions.
* **Clearer Code:** Using nested loops makes the logic for creating the pattern easier to understand.
* **Full Flag:** Includes all 13 stripes.


To compile and run this code:

1. Save it as `AmericanFlag.java`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Compile: `javac AmericanFlag.java`
5. Run: `java AmericanFlag`


You should see the American flag printed in your console. It might not be perfectly proportioned due to character spacing, but it will be much closer to the correct representation.
