Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles even length strings:**  The code now correctly checks for "abc" in the middle of even-length strings. It considers the two possible middle positions and checks if "abc" exists starting at either of them.
* **Clearer logic:** The `if` conditions are more structured and easier to follow.
* **Handles edge cases:** The code now explicitly handles `null` input and strings shorter than 3, preventing potential `NullPointerException` or `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` errors.
* **More comprehensive testing:** The `main` method includes a wider range of test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the solution, including null, short strings, odd and even length strings, and cases where "abc" is present and absent.
