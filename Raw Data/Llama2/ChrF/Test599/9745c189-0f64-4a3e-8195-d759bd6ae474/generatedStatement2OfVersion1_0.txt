Explanation:

1. **String inputString = ...;**:  We declare a string variable `inputString` and initialize it with the sample string.
2. **String lowercaseString = inputString.toLowerCase();**: This is the core part. We use the built-in `toLowerCase()` method of the `String` class to convert the entire string to lowercase. The result is stored in the `lowercaseString` variable.
3. **System.out.println(...);**:  We print the original and the lowercase string to the console to demonstrate the conversion.

**Important additions:**

* **Null and Empty String Handling:** The improved code demonstrates how to safely handle situations where the input string might be `null` or empty. This prevents `NullPointerException` errors.
* **Command-line Arguments:** The code now also shows how to process command-line arguments (if provided) and convert them to lowercase.  This makes the program more versatile.


How to compile and run from the command line:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `LowercaseString.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile:
