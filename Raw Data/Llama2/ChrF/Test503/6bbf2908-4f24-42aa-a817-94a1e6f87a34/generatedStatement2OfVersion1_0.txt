Key improvements:

* **Handles empty arrays correctly:** Added a check at the beginning to handle cases where the input array is empty.
* **Clearer variable names:** Changed `k` to `uniqueCount` to be more descriptive.
* **Concise comments:** Improved the comments to explain the logic better.
* **Comprehensive main method:** Added more test cases to the `main` method, including empty arrays and single-element arrays, for more thorough testing.
*  Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to cleanly print the relevant portion of the modified array in the `main` method.


This revised version addresses the potential issues and provides a more robust and understandable solution.
