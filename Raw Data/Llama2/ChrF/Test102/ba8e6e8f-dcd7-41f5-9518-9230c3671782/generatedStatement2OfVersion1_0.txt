Explanation:

1. **TreeSet:**  We use a `TreeSet` because it automatically stores elements in sorted order (natural ordering for the element type or a custom Comparator if provided), making it efficient for finding the greater than or equal to element.

2. **ceiling() Method:**  The `ceiling(E e)` method of the `TreeSet` class is key here.  It returns the least element in this set greater than or equal to the given element, or `null` if there is no such element.

3. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to create a `TreeSet`, add elements, and then use `ceiling()` to find the desired element. The examples show cases where the target element exists in the set, is less than the smallest element, and is greater than the largest element.  I've included an example with Strings to illustrate how natural ordering works with `TreeSet`.
