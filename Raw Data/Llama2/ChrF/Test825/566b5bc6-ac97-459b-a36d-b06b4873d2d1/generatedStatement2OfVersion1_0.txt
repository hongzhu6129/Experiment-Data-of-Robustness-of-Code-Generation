Key improvements in this revised version:

* **Handles edge cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays and the case where the target element is the first element of the array.
* **Clearer variable names:** More descriptive variable names (like `n` for array length) improve readability.
* **Concise code:** The code has been slightly simplified while maintaining clarity.
* **Added Test Cases:** Includes test cases demonstrating the function's behavior with elements that are present, absent, and also an empty array scenario.


This version addresses the potential issues identified in the previous responses and provides a more robust and complete solution.
