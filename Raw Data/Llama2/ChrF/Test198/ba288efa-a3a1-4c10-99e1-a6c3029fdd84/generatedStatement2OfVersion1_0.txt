Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` inputs, returning 0 in both cases.
- **Clearer variable naming:** `uniqueIndex` makes the purpose of the variable more explicit.
- **Comprehensive testing in `main`:** The `main` method now includes test cases for empty, null, single-element, and multi-element arrays with duplicates, demonstrating the robustness of the `removeDuplicates` function.
- **Output formatting:** The output in `main` now clearly displays the new length and the modified array (up to the new length), making it easier to understand the results.
- **Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`:** This ensures that only the relevant part of the array (up to the new length) is printed, avoiding printing garbage values that may exist beyond the new length.



This revised code provides a more complete and robust solution to the problem, adhering to the specified method signatures and handling edge cases effectively.
