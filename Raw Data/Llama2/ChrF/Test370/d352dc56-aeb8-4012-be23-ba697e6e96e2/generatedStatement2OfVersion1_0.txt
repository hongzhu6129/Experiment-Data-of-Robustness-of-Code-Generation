Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Pivot Selection:** The pivot is now explicitly calculated as the middle element using `array[lowerIndex + (higherIndex - lowerIndex) / 2]`.  This is generally a safer approach than always picking the first or last element, especially if the input might be partially sorted.
* **Comments explaining the logic:**  Added comments to clarify the purpose of the `while` loops and the recursive calls.
* **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `QuickSort` class and prints the sorted array.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** The `sort` method now correctly handles `null` or empty input arrays.
* **Improved Readability and Style:** Minor formatting and naming adjustments make the code easier to read.
* **Correctness:** The core quick sort logic is now more robust and accurate.


This refined version provides a more complete and understandable implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm.
