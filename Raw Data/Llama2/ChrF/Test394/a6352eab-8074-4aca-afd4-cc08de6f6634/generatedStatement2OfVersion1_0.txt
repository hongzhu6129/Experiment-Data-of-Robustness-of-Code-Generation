Explanation:

1. **Get Current Date:**  `Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();` creates a `Calendar` object representing the current date and time in the default locale and time zone.

2. **Extract Values:**  We use `calendar.get()` with different `Calendar` constants (e.g., `Calendar.YEAR`, `Calendar.MONTH`) to extract the year, month, week of the year, and day of the month. Note: `Calendar.MONTH` is 0-indexed (January is 0, February is 1, etc.), so we add 1 to get the typical month number.

3. **Print Values (Optional):**  The code includes `System.out.println()` statements to display the individual values, which can be helpful for debugging and understanding the output.

4. **Find Maximum:** `Math.max()` is used to find the maximum value among the four extracted values. We use nested `Math.max()` calls to compare them pairwise.

5. **Print Maximum:**  The final `System.out.println()` displays the calculated maximum value.
