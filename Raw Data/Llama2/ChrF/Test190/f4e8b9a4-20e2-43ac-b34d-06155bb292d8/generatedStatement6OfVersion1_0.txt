3. **Inside `main`:**
   - The `main` method first checks if exactly one command-line argument (the value of `n`) is provided. It handles incorrect usage by printing an error message.
   - It then uses `Integer.parseInt()` to convert the string argument to an integer.  A `try-catch` block handles potential `NumberFormatException` if the input is not a valid integer.
   - Finally, it calls the `printMatrix` method to generate and print the matrix.

4. **Inside `printMatrix`:**
   - The `printMatrix` method takes the integer `n` as input.
   - It uses nested loops to iterate through the rows and columns of the matrix (from 0 to n-1).
   - Inside the inner loop, it prints the value of each matrix element.  In this example, it prints `(i * n + j + 1)`, which generates a sequence of numbers from 1 up to n*n. You can easily modify the value being printed here to display other patterns or data as required.  
   - `System.out.println()` is used after each row to create the matrix structure.
