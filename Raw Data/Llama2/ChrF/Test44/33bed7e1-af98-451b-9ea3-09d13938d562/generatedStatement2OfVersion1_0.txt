**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **User Input:** The `main` method now uses a `Scanner` to get input from the user for the investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years.  This makes the code more interactive and useful.

2. **Clear Prompts:** Added prompts to tell the user what kind of input is expected.

3. **Error Handling (Optional but Recommended):**  While not strictly required by the prompt, in real-world code, you would add error handling (e.g., using `try-catch` blocks) to handle invalid input (like non-numeric values or negative numbers) gracefully.

4. **Formatted Output:** The output is formatted using `printf` to display the future value with two decimal places, making it look more professional.

5. **Closing the Scanner:** Added `input.close()` to release the `Scanner` resource after use. This is good practice to prevent resource leaks.


6. **`futureInvestmentValue` Method:** This method calculates the future investment value correctly using the formula:
