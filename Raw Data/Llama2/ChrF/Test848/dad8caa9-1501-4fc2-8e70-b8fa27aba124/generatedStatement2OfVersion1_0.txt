How to run with command-line arguments:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StringConcatenation.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac StringConcatenation.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with arguments like this: `java StringConcatenation "First String" " Second String"`  (Make sure to put strings in quotes if they contain spaces).


This revised answer provides two standard concatenation methods (+ operator and concat()) and demonstrates how to handle strings passed as command-line arguments within the `main` method. It also includes clear explanations and instructions.
