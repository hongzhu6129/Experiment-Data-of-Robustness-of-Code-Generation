Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles edge cases:** The code now correctly handles the cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning 0 as the sum of proper divisors in those cases.

2. **Efficiency with square root optimization:**  Iterating only up to the square root of `n` significantly improves efficiency, especially for large numbers.  The explanation for why this works is included in the code comments.

3. **Avoids duplicate divisors for perfect squares:** The `if (i * i != n)` check prevents adding the same divisor twice when `n` is a perfect square (e.g., for 25, we add 5 only once).

4. **Clearer comments:**  The comments explain the logic and the optimization used, making the code easier to understand.

5. **Long return type:**  The `proper_Divs_Sum` method now returns `Long` to handle potentially large sums of divisors.


Example Usage in `main` Demonstrated:

The `main` method now demonstrates how to use `proper_Divs_Sum` and print the result. I've also included the classic example of amicable numbers (220 and 284) to further illustrate how to use the function.
