Key improvements in this version:

- **Clarity and Readability:** Improved variable names (e.g., `current`, `next`) and comments enhance understanding.
- **Error Handling:** Added a check for `null` or empty input `intervals`.
- **Correct Merging Logic:** Ensures that overlapping intervals are correctly merged, even if the next interval's end is less than the current interval's end (e.g. [1,7], [5,6] merges to [1,7]).
- **Adding Last Interval:** The final `current` interval is correctly added to the `merged` list after the loop.
- **Object-Oriented:** Encapsulates the intervals within an `Interval` class.
- **Comparator:** Uses a `Comparator` with the `compare` method for sorting, making the sorting logic more concise and readable.


This revised code provides a robust and well-structured solution for merging overlapping intervals.
