**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner cases, to test the Java program:

| Test Case | Input 1 | Input 2 | Expected Output | Notes                                  |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1        | 5       | 10      | 50             | Positive numbers                       |
| 2        | -3      | 7       | -21            | Negative and positive number          |
| 3        | 0       | 15      | 0              | Zero                                   |
| 4        | -8      | -4      | 32             | Two negative numbers                   |
| 5        | 999999999999 | 2      | 1999999999998 | Large numbers (using long to avoid overflow)|
| 6        | -999999999999 | -2     | 1999999999998 | Large negative numbers |
| 7        | 2147483647  | 2       | 4294967294    | Integer Max Value * 2 (overflow if using int) |
| 8        | -2147483648 | -1      | 2147483648    | Integer Min Value * -1 |


**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. **Manually:**  You can run the program and enter these values one by one to check the output.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  Use a testing framework like JUnit. This is a much better approach, especially as your program grows larger.  Here's a simple JUnit example:
