Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Input:** The code now uses `Scanner` to get integer input from the user.  It prompts the user to enter the two integers.

2. **Comparison Logic:**  It uses `if-else if-else` statements to compare `number1` and `number2`.

3. **Output:**  The output now matches the requested format, displaying the comparison results with the appropriate symbols (=, <, <=, !=, >, >=).  I've added the `!=`, `>=` comparisons, and the second `<` and `>` comparisons based on the example in the prompt since a full comparison usually includes these.

4. **Resource Management:**  The `input.close();` line is added to close the `Scanner` and release the resources it uses.  It's good practice to close resources when you're finished with them.

5. **Clarity:** The code is formatted for better readability.
