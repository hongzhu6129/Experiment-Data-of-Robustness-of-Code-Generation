Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Stability:** The code now iterates backward in the final loop to maintain stability. This ensures that elements with the same value appear in the sorted output in the same order as they appeared in the input.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:**  Added tests and modified the code to explicitly handle edge cases:
   - Empty array: Returns immediately without doing anything.
   - Single element array:  Also returns without unnecessary operations.
   - Array with duplicate values: Now sorts correctly, maintaining stability.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** More descriptive variable names like `range`, `count`, and `output` improve readability.

4. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the different stages of the algorithm.

5. **Test Cases in `main`:** Included various test cases in the `main` method (including edge cases) to demonstrate the correctness of the implementation.

6. **`printArray` Helper Function:**  Added a `printArray` function for convenient output in `main`.


This revised code is a more robust and understandable implementation of Counting Sort.  It follows the specified method signatures and provides better error handling and clarity.
