**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FileSize.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using the command: `javac FileSize.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code with the file path as an argument: `java FileSize /path/to/your/file.txt`  (Replace `/path/to/your/file.txt` with the actual path to the file).


**Explanation:**

* **`main` method:**
    * Takes the file path as a command-line argument.
    * Creates a `File` object.
    * Checks if the file exists and is a regular file.
    * Calls the helper methods to get the file size in different units and prints the results.
* **`filesize_in_Bytes` method:**
    * Gets the file size in bytes using `file.length()`.
    * Returns the size as a formatted string.
* **`filesize_in_kiloBytes` method:**
    * Gets the file size in bytes.
    * Divides by 1024 to convert to kilobytes.
    * Returns the size as a formatted string (two decimal places).
* **`filesize_in_megaBytes` method:**
    * Gets the file size in bytes.
    * Divides by (1024 * 1024) to convert to megabytes.
    * Returns the size as a formatted string (two decimal places).


**Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes basic error handling to check if the file path is valid and points to a file.
* **Formatting:** The output is formatted to two decimal places for kilobytes and megabytes for better readability.
* **Clearer Instructions:**  The instructions on how to compile and run are more explicit.


This improved version is more robust and user-friendly.  It also provides a better learning experience by demonstrating good coding practices like error handling and formatted output.
