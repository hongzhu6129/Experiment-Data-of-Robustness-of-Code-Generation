**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes error handling for incorrect input.  It checks if exactly three arguments are provided and uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the inputs are not valid integers.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** The variable names are more descriptive (`num1`, `num2`, `num3` instead of `a`, `b`, `c`).

3. **Helper Function:** The logic for checking the difference is extracted into a separate `checkDifference` method. This improves code readability and organization.

4. **Absolute Difference:** The code uses `Math.abs()` to calculate the absolute difference between the numbers, ensuring that the order of subtraction doesn't affect the result.  This is crucial for correctly interpreting the "20 or more less" condition.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CheckDifference.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler:  `javac CheckDifference.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with three integer arguments: `java CheckDifference 15 20 25`  (This will output `false` as in your example).  You can change the input numbers to test different cases.


**Example Usage and Output:**

* `java CheckDifference 15 20 25`  Output: `false`
* `java CheckDifference 10 30 20`  Output: `true` (because 10 is 20 less than 30-20 = 10 +20)
* `java CheckDifference 5 10 65`  Output: `true` (because 65 is more than 20 greater than 10-5 = 5 +20 )
