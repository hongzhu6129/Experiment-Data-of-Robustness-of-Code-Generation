Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly adheres to the specified method signatures: `public static void main(String[])` and `private static int[] Saddleback(int[][], int, int, int)`.

2. **Saddleback Search Implementation:** The `Saddleback` method correctly implements the saddleback search algorithm. It starts from the top-right corner and efficiently eliminates either a row or a column in each step based on the comparison with the target.

3. **Return Value:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` containing the row and column indices of the target if found.  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}` to indicate this.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` method, including handling cases where the target is found and not found. It also provides a clear example of a sorted 2D array.

5. **Comments and Readability:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the logic and steps within the `Saddleback` method.  Variable names are descriptive (e.g., `m`, `n`, `row`, `col`, `target`).


This improved version addresses the prompt's requirements, provides a working solution, and is well-structured for clarity and understanding.
