Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Case-Insensitive Counting:** The `CountCharacters` method now converts the input string to lowercase using `str.toLowerCase()`. This ensures that 'P' and 'p' are considered the same character.

2. **Clearer Output:**  The `showDuplicates` method now handles the case where there are no duplicates by printing "No duplicates found."  It also prints the original string for clarity.

3. **Focus on Letters:** The code only counts and reports duplicates of letters (a-z). Other characters are ignored. This is implemented by checking  `if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z')` in `CountCharacters`.

4. **Efficiency:** Using an `int[]` array (charCounts) for counting is a very efficient way to track character frequencies.

5. **Modularity:**  The code is now well-organized into separate methods (`CountCharacters`, `showDuplicates`, `main`) which makes it more readable, maintainable, and reusable.

6. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates the function with various example strings, including cases with and without duplicates.



This improved version provides a more robust and clear solution for counting and printing duplicate characters in a string while adhering to the required method signatures.
