**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Positive Number:**
   - Input: 7
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 7 from 7x1 to 7x10.

2. **Zero:**
   - Input: 0
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 0 (all results will be 0).  This is a corner case.

3. **Negative Number:**
   - Input: -5
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of -5 from -5x1 to -5x10.

4. **Large Positive Number:**
   - Input: 12345
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 12345 from 12345x1 to 12345x10.  Tests handling of larger numbers.

5. **Large Negative Number:**
   - Input: -98765
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of -98765 from -98765x1 to -98765x10.

6. **One:**
   - Input: 1
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 1 (which is essentially just counting from 1 to 10).


**How to run the test cases (manually):**

1. Compile the Java code: `javac MultiplicationTable.java`
2. Run the compiled code with each input value: `java MultiplicationTable`  (Then enter the input number when prompted).
3. Verify that the output matches the expected output for each test case.


**Automated Testing (JUnit Example - Optional but recommended):**

For more robust testing, you can use a testing framework like JUnit. Here's an example:
