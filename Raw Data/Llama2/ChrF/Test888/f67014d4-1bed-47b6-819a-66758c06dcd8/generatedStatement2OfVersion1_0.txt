**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner/edge cases:

1. **Positive Number:**
   - Input: 7
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 7 from 7x1 to 7x10.

2. **Zero:**
   - Input: 0
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 0 (all results will be 0).  This is a corner case.

3. **Negative Number:**
   - Input: -5
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of -5 from -5x1 to -5x10.

4. **Large Positive Number:**
   - Input: 10000  (or any other large number)
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 10000. Tests for potential overflow issues (though Java's `int` type can handle this range).

5. **Large Negative Number:**
   - Input: -10000 (or any other large negative number)
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of -10000.

6. **One:**
   - Input: 1
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 1 (results will be 1 to 10).  This is a base case.

7. **Ten:**  (As specifically requested in the prompt)
   - Input: 10
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 10.


**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. **Manual Testing:**  You can run the program multiple times, entering each test case input manually and verifying the output against the expected output.

2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  For more robust testing, use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a basic example of how you might write a JUnit test:
