**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The code now uses `Math.abs(n)` to handle negative integers correctly.  The sum of digits should be the same regardless of the sign.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `sum` instead of `s` improves readability.

3. **Test Cases:** The `testCases()` method demonstrates how to write basic assertions to check the correctness of the `function` method. This is crucial for ensuring your code works as expected for different inputs.  I've included several test cases, including:
   - Positive numbers
   - Zero
   - Negative numbers
   - Large numbers
   - Single-digit numbers
   - Numbers containing zero
   - `Integer.MAX_VALUE`
   - `Integer.MIN_VALUE` (handled carefully due to two's complement representation)

**How to Run Test Cases:**

To enable assertions, you need to compile and run the Java code with the `-ea` (enable assertions) flag:
