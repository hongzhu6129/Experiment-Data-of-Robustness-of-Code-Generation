The provided code implements the Gnome Sort algorithm using only the specified method signatures: `void gnomeSort(int[])` and `public static void main(String[])`.  It effectively sorts the given integer array using the Gnome Sort logic. The `main` method provides test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the sorting algorithm with various input arrays, including already sorted, arrays with duplicates, and an empty array.  The output clearly shows the sorted arrays after applying the `gnomeSort` method.
