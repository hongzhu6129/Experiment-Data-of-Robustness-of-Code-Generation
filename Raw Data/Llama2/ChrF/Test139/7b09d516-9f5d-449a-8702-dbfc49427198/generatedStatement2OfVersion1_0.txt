Key improvements:

- **Clearer Explanation:** Added comments to explain the different methods and their usage.
- **Java 8 Lambda:** Demonstrated the more concise lambda expression approach for creating the comparator.
- **Custom Object Example:**  Included an example of how to use a `PriorityQueue` with custom objects (a `Person` class) and prioritize based on a specific property (age), which is a very common use case.
- **Output Clarity:**  Improved the output to clearly show the elements being polled from the queue and the resulting order.
- **Method Signatures Followed:**  The code adheres to the requested `public static void main(String[] args)` signature.
