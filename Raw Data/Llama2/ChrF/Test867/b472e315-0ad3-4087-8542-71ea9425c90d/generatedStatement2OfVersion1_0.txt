Explanation:

1. **Argument Handling:** The `main` method first checks if two file paths are provided as command-line arguments.  If not, it prints usage instructions.
2. **Try-with-Resources:** It uses try-with-resources to ensure that the `BufferedReader` objects are closed automatically, even if exceptions occur.
3. **Reading Lines:** It reads the files line by line using `BufferedReader.readLine()`.
4. **Comparison Loop:**  The `while` loop continues until either both files reach the end or a difference is found.
5. **Null Checks:** Inside the loop, it checks if either `line1` or `line2` is `null` (indicating the end of a file).
6. **String Comparison:**  `line1.compareTo(line2)` compares the two lines lexicographically.  This method returns:
    - 0 if the strings are equal.
    - A negative value if `line1` is lexicographically less than `line2`.
    - A positive value if `line1` is lexicographically greater than `line2`.
7. **Result:** The `comparisonResult` is stored, and the loop breaks if a difference is found.
8. **Output:** After the loop, the program prints the result based on the final `comparisonResult`.
9. **Error Handling:** The `catch` block handles potential `IOExceptions` during file reading.



To compile and run:

1. Save the code as `CompareFilesLexicographically.java`.
2. Compile: `javac CompareFilesLexicographically.java`
3. Run:  `java CompareFilesLexicographically file1.txt file2.txt` (Replace `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` with the actual file paths.)
