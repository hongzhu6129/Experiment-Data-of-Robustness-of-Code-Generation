**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`removeString(String, String)` Method:**
   - Uses the built-in `replace()` method which is the most efficient way to remove all occurrences of a substring.
   - Includes a null check to handle cases where either the main string or the string to remove is null. This prevents `NullPointerExceptions`. You can modify this to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if nulls are not allowed.


2. **`main(String[])` Method:**
   - Provides several test cases to demonstrate different scenarios:
     - Removing a substring that appears multiple times.
     - Removing a substring that doesn't exist.
     - Handling null and empty strings.
   - The output clearly shows the original string and the result after removal.


3. **Key improvements over using a loop and `substring()`:**
   - **Efficiency:** `String.replace()` is highly optimized compared to manually iterating and concatenating substrings, especially for larger strings and frequent removals.
   - **Simplicity and Readability:**  The code is much cleaner and easier to understand using `replace()`.
   - **Correctness:**  The loop and substring approach can easily introduce errors if not handled carefully (off-by-one errors, etc.).  `replace()` takes care of all these details for you.


4. **Handling Edge Cases (Nulls/Empty Strings):**
    - The provided code demonstrates how to handle `null` inputs.  You can choose to return the original string, return `null`, or throw an exception as appropriate for your requirements.
    - The code also shows how to handle empty strings (`""`). Removing an empty string does nothing, while removing from an empty string also results in an empty string.  These are standard behaviors.
