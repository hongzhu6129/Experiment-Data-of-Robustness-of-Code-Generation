Here's how this code works within the `main` method constraints:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n`:  Represents the total number of coins available. You can change this value to test with different inputs.
   - `k`: Keeps track of the current row number (0-indexed).
   - `coinsUsed`:  Tracks the total number of coins used so far.

2. **Looping and Row Creation:**
   - The `while (coinsUsed <= n)` loop continues as long as we haven't used up all the coins.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `k++`:  Increment the row number.
     - `coinsInRow = k`: The number of coins in the current row is equal to the row number.
     - **Conditional Check:** `if (coinsUsed + coinsInRow <= n)`: Checks if we have enough coins to create a complete row.
       - If yes: Print `k` coins (represented by 'O') followed by a newline.
       - If no (not enough coins for a full row): Print the remaining coins and then exit the loop.

3. **Output:** The code prints the walkway shape row by row, with each row having `k` coins (where `k` is the row number) until we run out of coins.
