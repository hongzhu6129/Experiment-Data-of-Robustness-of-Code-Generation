 Only use the method signatures public static void sort(int[]), public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the Selection Sort Algorithm.\nWikipedia says "In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs less efficiently than the similar insertion sort". \n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n Avoid using Solution as the class name.
