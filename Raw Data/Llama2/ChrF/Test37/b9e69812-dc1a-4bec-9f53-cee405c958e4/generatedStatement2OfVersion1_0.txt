Key improvements in this revised version:

* **Generics:** The `insertElement` method now uses generics `<T>`, making it more flexible and able to handle LinkedLists of any type, not just Strings.
* **Error Handling/Robustness:** Handles edge cases like out-of-bounds or negative index gracefully:
    * **Negative index:** Inserts at the beginning of the list.
    * **Index beyond the size:** Appends the element to the end of the list. 
* **Clearer Example:** The `main` method provides multiple examples showing normal insertion, out-of-bounds insertion, and negative index insertion, demonstrating how the method behaves in different situations.
* **Conciseness:** The code is now more concise and readable.


This version addresses all the previous shortcomings and provides a more complete and practical solution for inserting elements into a LinkedList in Java.
