**Test Cases**

**Corner Cases:**

* **Empty arrays:** `funding = [], buffer = []`
* **Negative values in arrays:** `funding = [10, -5, 30, 40], buffer = [5, 5, -5, 5]`
* **Funding request greater than available buffer:** `funding = [100, 20, 30, 40], buffer = [0, 0, 0, 0]`

**Other Test Cases:**

* **Funding request can be fulfilled with buffer:** `funding = [10, 20, 30, 40], buffer = [5, 5, 5, 5]`
* **Funding request cannot be fulfilled due to insufficient buffer:** `funding = [10, 20, 30, 40], buffer = [0, 0, 0, 0]`
* **Funding request can be fulfilled with buffer from the next day:** `funding = [100, 50, 75, 25], buffer = [25, 25, 25, 25]`
* **Funding request cannot be fulfilled due to insufficient buffer from the next day:** `funding = [50, 50, 50, 50], buffer = [25, 25, 25, 25]`
