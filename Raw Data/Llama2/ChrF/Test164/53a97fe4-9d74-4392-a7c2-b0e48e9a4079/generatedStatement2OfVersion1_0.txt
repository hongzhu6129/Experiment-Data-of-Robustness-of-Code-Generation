**Explanation and Different "Legitimacy" Interpretations:**

The core of the solution lies in the `convert()` method.  Because "legitimacy" isn't a standard mathematical or programming concept, I've provided several possible interpretations within the `convert()` method.  You'll need to **uncomment the one that best fits your specific definition of "legitimacy."**

1. **Absolute Value:** This interprets "legitimacy" as the magnitude of the number, disregarding its sign.

2. **Signum Function:** This reduces the number to its sign: 1 for positive, -1 for negative, and 0 for zero.

3. **Custom Mapping:** This demonstrates how you can create your own rules for mapping input values to legitimacy values. I've used a simple example, but you can adapt it to your needs.

4. **Digit Sum:**  This calculates the sum of the digits of the number, which can be another interpretation of "legitimacy" depending on the context.

5. **Return Unchanged:**  If "legitimacy" doesn't have a particular meaning in your case, this simply returns the input number itself.


**How to Use:**

1. **Choose the appropriate interpretation of "legitimacy"** from the `convert()` method and uncomment that block of code.
2. **Compile the code:**  `javac IntegerToLegitimacy.java`
3. **Run the code:** `java IntegerToLegitimacy`
   You can change the `input` value in the `main()` method to test with different integer values.  The output will print the original input and its calculated "legitimacy value".
