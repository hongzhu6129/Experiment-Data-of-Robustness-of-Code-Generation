Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct Star Pattern:**  Accurately reproduces the alternating 6-star and 7-star rows in the flag's canton.
* **Simplified Code:** Uses more efficient looping and printing logic.
* **pct Argument:** Includes the special `pct` argument logic as requested.  If you run the program with the command-line argument `pct` (e.g., `java AmericanFlag pct`), it will place "pct" as specified.  If you run it without any arguments, it prints the standard flag.


To compile and run:

1. Save the code as `AmericanFlag.java`.
2. Compile: `javac AmericanFlag.java`
3. Run with "pct": `java AmericanFlag pct`
4. Run without "pct": `java AmericanFlag`


This revised code should produce the desired American flag output, both with and without the "pct" placement.
