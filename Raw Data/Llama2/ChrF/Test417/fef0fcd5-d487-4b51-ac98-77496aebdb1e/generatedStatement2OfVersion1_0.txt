**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The `polyEval` method implements Horner's method for polynomial evaluation.  This method is more efficient than the traditional approach (evaluating each term separately and then summing).  It reduces the number of multiplications required.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `coefficients` and `x` makes the code more readable.

3. **Iterating Backwards:** The code iterates through the `coefficients` list from the highest power to the constant term (backwards). This is how Horner's method is implemented.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `polyEval` method with a sample polynomial and x-value.  I've also added a second example to show its versatility.

5. **ArrayList for Coefficients:**  Using an `ArrayList` to store the coefficients makes it easy to handle polynomials of varying degrees.  You just add the coefficients to the list in the order of descending powers of x.

6. **Comments:**  The code includes comments to explain the important parts.


**How Horner's Method Works in `polyEval`:**

Let's trace the first example (-19 + 7x - 4x^2 + 6x^3 at x = 3):

1. **Initialization:** `result` is 0.

2. **First Iteration (i = 3):**  `result = 0 * 3 + 6 = 6`

3. **Second Iteration (i = 2):** `result = 6 * 3 + (-4) = 14`

4. **Third Iteration (i = 1):** `result = 14 * 3 + 7 = 49`

5. **Fourth Iteration (i = 0):** `result = 49 * 3 + (-19) = 128`

The final result is 128, which is correct.  Horner's method efficiently computes the polynomial by minimizing multiplications.
