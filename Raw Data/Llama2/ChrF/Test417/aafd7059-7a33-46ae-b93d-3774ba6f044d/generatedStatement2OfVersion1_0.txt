**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The provided method `polyEval` implements Horner's method (or Horner's scheme), which is an efficient way to evaluate polynomials.  It reduces the number of multiplications required compared to a naive approach.

2. **Clarity and Comments:**  The code includes comments explaining the purpose of the code and the example usage.  This makes it more understandable.

3. **Generality:** The `polyEval` method works for polynomials of any degree (as determined by the size of the `coefficients` list).

4. **Error Handling (Optional):**  For a more robust solution, you might want to add error handling to `polyEval` to check for an empty `coefficients` list:
