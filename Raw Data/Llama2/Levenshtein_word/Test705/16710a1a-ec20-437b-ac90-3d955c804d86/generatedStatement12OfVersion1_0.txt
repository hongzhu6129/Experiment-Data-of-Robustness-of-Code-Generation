**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. **Manual Testing:**  You can run the Java program and manually enter each test case input.  Visually compare the output with the expected output.

2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  A better approach is to use a testing framework like JUnit.  You would write separate test methods for each case, asserting that the actual output of `printMultiplicationTable()` matches the expected output.  This makes testing much more efficient and reliable, especially for regression testing (making sure future changes to the code don't break existing functionality).
