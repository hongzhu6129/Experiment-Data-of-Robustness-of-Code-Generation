This script runs the Java program for each input, captures the last line of the output (which contains the result of `num x 11`), extracts the numerical value, and compares it with the expected output.  Make sure to compile your Java code (`javac MultiplicationTable.java`) before running the script.


This comprehensive testing approach ensures your program's correctness across a range of scenarios. Using a proper testing framework like JUnit is highly recommended for more complex projects.
