4. **Large Positive Integer:**  (Tests potential overflow if you were using `byte` or `short`, but `int` handles this fine)
   - Input: 12345
   - Expected Output:  Multiplication table of 12345 up to 12345 x 10 = 123450

5. **Large Negative Integer:** (Similar overflow check, but `int` is fine)
   - Input: -12345
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of -12345 up to -12345 x 10 = -123450



**How to Run Test Cases (Manually):**

1.  Compile the Java code: `javac MultiplicationTable.java`
2.  Run the code from your terminal: `java MultiplicationTable`
3.  Enter the test input when prompted.  Visually compare the output with the expected output.


**Automated Testing (Recommended):**

For more thorough and efficient testing, especially if you modify the code later, use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a simple JUnit 5 example:
