4. **Large Positive Number:**  (To test potential overflow issues, though Java's `int` type handles this well)
   - Input: `2147483647` (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
   - Expected Output:  (Check that the output is correct mathematically; there shouldn't be overflow exceptions)


5. **Large Negative Number:**
   - Input: `-2147483648` (Integer.MIN_VALUE)
   - Expected Output: (Similar check as above)


**How to Run Test Cases:**

You can either:

* **Manually:** Run the program multiple times, entering each test input.  Compare the output with the expected output.
* **Automated Tests (Recommended):**  Use a testing framework like JUnit. This is a much more robust and efficient way to test.  Here's a simple JUnit example:
