**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Command-line Arguments:** The code now takes input as command-line arguments.  This is a more standard way to provide input to Java programs run from the terminal/console.  To run it, you would compile the code (e.g., `javac TwentyLess.java`) and then execute it with the three numbers as arguments (e.g., `java TwentyLess 15 20 25`).
2. **Error Handling:** The code includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters non-integer input. This makes the program more robust.
3. **Clearer Logic:** The `isTwentyLess` method is now more concise and directly checks the conditions using `Math.abs()` to handle both positive and negative differences.
4. **Adherence to the Prompt:**  The solution now strictly adheres to the `public static void main(String[] args)` signature requirement. The helper function `isTwentyLess` is private.


**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `TwentyLess.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac TwentyLess.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled program with three integer arguments: `java TwentyLess 15 20 25`  (Replace 15, 20, and 25 with your desired inputs).
