**Explanation and How to Run:**

1. **Command-line Arguments:** This program expects you to provide the two double values as command-line arguments when you run it.
2. **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles potential errors:
   - `NumberFormatException`: If the input arguments are not valid doubles (e.g., you enter text).
   - `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`: If you don't provide enough arguments (fewer than two).
3. **Input Parsing:** `Double.parseDouble()` converts the string arguments from the command line to double values.
4. **Range Check:** The core logic is in the `boolean result` line. It checks if both `num1` and `num2` are strictly greater than 0 and strictly less than 1 using the logical AND operator (`&&`).
5. **Output:** The program prints `true` if both numbers are within the range and `false` otherwise.


**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CheckRange.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:
