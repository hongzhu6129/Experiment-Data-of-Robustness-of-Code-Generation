Key improvements and explanations in this code:

* **Clearer Comments:**  The comments explain the logic, purpose of variables, and the algorithm's steps thoroughly. This is crucial for an educational piece of code.
* **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` input, making it more robust.
* **Illustrative `main` Method:** The `main` method includes multiple test cases (including edge cases and a case with no duplicates) to demonstrate the function's behavior in various scenarios.
* **Output Formatting:** The output is formatted using `Arrays.toString` (and `Arrays.copyOfRange` to only print the relevant part of the array) to provide a clear and readable representation of the results.


This improved version provides a much better educational experience for anyone learning about removing duplicates from a sorted array.
