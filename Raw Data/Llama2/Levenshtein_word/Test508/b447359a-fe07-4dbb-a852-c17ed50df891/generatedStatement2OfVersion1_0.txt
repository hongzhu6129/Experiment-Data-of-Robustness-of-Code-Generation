Explanation:

1. **Import LinkedList:**  `import java.util.LinkedList;` imports the necessary class for working with linked lists.

2. **main Method:** The `main` method is the entry point of the program.

3. **Create Linked Lists:** Two linked lists are created: `list1` (initially empty) and `list2` (populated with elements).

4. **checkEmpty Method:** This method takes a `LinkedList` of any type (`<?>` is a wildcard) as input. Inside the method, `list.isEmpty()` is used to check if the list is empty.  The appropriate message is printed to the console.

5. **Calling checkEmpty:**  The `checkEmpty` method is called with both `list1` and `list2` to demonstrate the check on both an empty and a non-empty list.

6. **Alternative Approach (Directly in main):** The examples with `list3` and `list4` show how you can use `list.isEmpty()` directly within the `main` method without needing a separate `checkEmpty` method. This is often more concise if you only need to check emptiness in a single place.
