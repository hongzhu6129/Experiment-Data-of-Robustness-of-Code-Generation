Key comparison methods demonstrated:

1. **`equals()`:** Checks if two lists are identical (same elements in the same order).
2. **Sorting and then using `equals()`:**  Checks if lists have the same elements regardless of the original order. Useful if order doesn't matter.
3. **Sorting and then using equals() for frequency comparison:**  Checks if two lists have the same elements with the same frequencies regardless of the order. (Useful if the lists might contain duplicates).
4. **`containsAll()`:** Checks if one list contains all the elements of another list (order doesn't matter in the second list, but all must be present in the first).


This revised example provides a more comprehensive illustration of ArrayList comparison techniques.  It addresses different comparison scenarios and clearly explains the nuances of each method.
