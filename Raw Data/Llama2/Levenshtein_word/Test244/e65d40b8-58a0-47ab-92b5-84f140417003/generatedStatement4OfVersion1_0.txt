3. Verify that the output matches the "Expected Output" in the table.



**Key Improvements in this Code:**

* **Using `long`:**  This handles potential integer overflow if the product of the two numbers is larger than the maximum value of an `int`.
* **Error Handling (Optional):** For even more robust code, you could add error handling to check if the user input is actually a valid number (using a `try-catch` block).
* **Clear Prompts:** The code provides clear prompts to the user.
* **Resource Management:** The `input.close()` line closes the `Scanner` to release resources.


This improved code and comprehensive set of test cases ensures that the program functions correctly for a wide range of inputs, including critical edge cases.
