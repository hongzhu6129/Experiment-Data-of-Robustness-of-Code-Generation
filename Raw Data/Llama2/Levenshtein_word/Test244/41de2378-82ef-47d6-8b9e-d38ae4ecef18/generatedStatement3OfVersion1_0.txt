   This JUnit example shows how you can automate the process of testing various inputs and asserting (checking) that the output is what you expect.  You would need to add the JUnit library to your project.




By using a variety of test cases, including edge cases and overflow scenarios, you can ensure that your program is robust and handles a wide range of inputs correctly. Using a testing framework like JUnit makes this process much more efficient and manageable.
