**Explanation:**

Since the program is successfully compiling and running using a Java compiler and runtime environment, it inherently proves that Java is installed.  The code then accesses and prints various system properties related to the Java installation using `System.getProperty()`, providing details about the version, vendor, and other relevant information.  This confirms not only that Java is present but also reveals specific details about the installation.
