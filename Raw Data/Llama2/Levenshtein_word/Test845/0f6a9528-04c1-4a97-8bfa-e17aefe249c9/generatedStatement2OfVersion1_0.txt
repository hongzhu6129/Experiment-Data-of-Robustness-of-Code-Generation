**Explanation:**

The core of this solution relies on the `System.getProperty()` method. This method retrieves system properties, including information about the Java installation.  If Java is installed,  `System.getProperty("java.version")` (and the other properties) will return a string representing the version information. If Java isn't installed, it will return `null`.  We can then use this to determine if Java is present.  

The code prints out several key Java properties to give more detailed information about the installation.  The final `if/else` block provides a simpler "yes/no" answer to the question "Is Java installed?"


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code above as `CheckJavaInstallation.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler:
