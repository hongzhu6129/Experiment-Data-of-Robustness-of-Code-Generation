This code fulfills the prompt's requirements by:

1. **Using only `public static void main(String[] args)`:** The entire logic resides within the main method.
2. **Checking for Java installation:** It utilizes `System.getProperty()` to retrieve Java-related system properties.  If these properties are accessible, it implies Java is installed. The output mirrors the sample information provided in the prompt.
3. **Java 1.8 compatibility:** The code is compatible with Java 1.8 (and later versions).


**How to run the code:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CheckJavaInstallation.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac CheckJavaInstallation.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code using: `java CheckJavaInstallation`


The output will display the Java version, runtime version, home directory, vendor, vendor URL, and classpath, confirming that Java is installed and providing details about the installation.  It will also explicitly state "Java is installed on this system."
