**How to Run the Test Cases (Manually):**

1. Compile the Java code: `javac CharacterCounter.java`
2. Run the program: `java CharacterCounter`
3. Enter the input string when prompted and verify the output against the expected output.



These test cases cover a good range of scenarios and will help ensure that your `CharacterCounter` program is robust and correctly handles different types of input.  You could automate these tests using a testing framework like JUnit, which is the standard for Java testing.  Let me know if you'd like to see how to do that.
