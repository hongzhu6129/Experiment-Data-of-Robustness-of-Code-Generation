**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **In-Place Modification:** The `removeElement` method modifies the original array `nums` directly.  This is more efficient than creating a new array.  The elements not equal to `val` are moved to the beginning of the array.

2. **`k` as a Counter and Index:**  The variable `k` serves two purposes:
   - It keeps track of the number of elements that are *not* equal to `val`. This is the new length of the array.
   - It acts as the index where the next element that's not equal to `val` should be placed.

3. **Clearer Output:** The `main` method now prints both the original array and the new length. I've also added an optional part in the `main` method that shows how to create a new array containing only the updated elements if you need to work with a separate array.

4. **Conciseness and Efficiency:**  The code avoids unnecessary temporary variables or complex logic, making it more efficient and easier to understand.
