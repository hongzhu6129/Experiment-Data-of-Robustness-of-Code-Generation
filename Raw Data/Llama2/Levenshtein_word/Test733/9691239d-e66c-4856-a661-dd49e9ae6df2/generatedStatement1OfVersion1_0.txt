**Java Program to Find the Missing Number in a Given Array**

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array containing numbers from 0 to n, where n is the size of the array, find the missing number in the array.

**Algorithm:**

1. Create a sum variable and initialize it to 0.
2. Iterate through the array and add each element to the sum variable.
3. Calculate the expected sum of the array using the formula: (n * (n + 1)) / 2.
4. Subtract the actual sum from the expected sum to get the missing number.

**Java Code:**
