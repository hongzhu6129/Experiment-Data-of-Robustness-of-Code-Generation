The requested pattern in the problem description "jj aaa v vaaaj j aa v v a aj fhsaa v aaaa" seems to be a typo or misinterpretation of the typical "JAVA" pattern. This code produces the standard JAVA pattern as seen in many introductory programming texts.  If you did intend a different pattern, please provide a clearer description or visual representation.
