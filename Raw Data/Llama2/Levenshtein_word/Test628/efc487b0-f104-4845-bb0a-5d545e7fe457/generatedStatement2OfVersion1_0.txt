Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays and null inputs, returning 0 in both cases.
- **In-place modification:** The `removeDuplicates` method modifies the original array in place, as requested.
- **Clearer variable names:** The variable `uniqueIndex` more accurately reflects its purpose.
- **Comprehensive testing:** The `main` method includes several test cases to demonstrate the functionality with different inputs.
- **Output formatting:** The output in the `main` method now clearly shows the modified array and its new length.
- **Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`:** This is essential to avoid printing the unmodified portion of the array after the unique elements.


This revised code provides a more robust and complete solution to the problem.
