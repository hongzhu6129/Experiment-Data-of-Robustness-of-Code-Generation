Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Used `charCounts` instead of just `counts` for better readability.
2. **Comments:** Added comments to explain each section of the code.
3. **Assumed Lowercase:** The code assumes lowercase English alphabet characters for simplicity.  If you need to handle uppercase or other characters, you'll need to adjust the `charCounts` array size and character indexing.
4. **Test Cases in `main`:** Added more test cases in the `main` method to demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs. including edge cases.
5. **Return -1 (for completeness):**  Although the problem statement guarantees at least one unique character,  I added a `return -1`  at the end for completeness (good practice in general).  This will make the code more robust if the input doesn't adhere to the stated constraint.
6. **Efficiency:** The code is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the string because it iterates through the string twice at most (once to count characters, and once to find the first unique character).  The space complexity is O(1) (constant) because the `charCounts` array has a fixed size of 26 regardless of the string's length.
