Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:**  The code now explicitly checks for `null` arrays and arrays of different lengths, returning 0 in those cases. This makes it more robust.
* **Clearer variable names:** `diff` is used to store the absolute difference, making the code easier to follow.
* **`Math.abs()`:** Uses `Math.abs()` to calculate the absolute difference, ensuring correct comparison even if `arr2[i]` is greater than `arr1[i]`.
* **Example usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `countDifferences` method with several examples, including edge cases, to show how it works.
* **Comments:** Added a few more comments to explain key parts of the logic.
