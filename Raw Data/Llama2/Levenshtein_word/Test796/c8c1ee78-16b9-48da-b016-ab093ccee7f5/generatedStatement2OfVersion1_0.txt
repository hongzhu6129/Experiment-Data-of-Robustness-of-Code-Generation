Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Names:** `leftDepth` and `rightDepth` improve readability.
* **Simplified Conditional:** The `if/else` is more concise.
* **Comprehensive Testing:**  The `main` method includes test cases for an empty tree and a skewed tree, demonstrating the code's robustness.  This is *crucial* for verifying correctness.
* **Comments:** Explanatory comments make the code easier to understand.


This revised code provides a more robust and understandable solution for calculating the maximum depth of a binary tree.  The added test cases are especially important for demonstrating that it handles various tree structures correctly.
