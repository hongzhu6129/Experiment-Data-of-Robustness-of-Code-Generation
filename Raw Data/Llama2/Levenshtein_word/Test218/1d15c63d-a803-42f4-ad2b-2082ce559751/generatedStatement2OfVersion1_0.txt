Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays and single-element arrays. These are considered to satisfy the condition (vacuously true) because there are no adjacent pairs to check.

2. **Clearer Logic:** The `if` condition inside the loop is simplified. It now directly checks if *neither* of the adjacent elements is equal to `num`. This makes the logic easier to understand.

3. **Comments and Explanation:** Added comments to clarify the purpose of the code and the logic within the `checkAdjacent` method.

4. **Test Cases:** Included a variety of test cases in `main` to demonstrate the behavior of the code with different inputs, including edge cases.  This helps in verifying that the function works correctly.
