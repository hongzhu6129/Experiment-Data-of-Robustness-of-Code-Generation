**Educational Paper: Checking Well-Repetition in Discrete Sequences**

**Introduction**

In the realm of discrete mathematics, the concept of well-repetition plays a significant role. A sequence is said to be well-repetition if every element of the sequence appears at least twice. Determining whether a given sequence is well-repetition is crucial in various fields, such as computer science, pattern recognition, and signal processing.

This paper presents an efficient algorithm for checking well-repetition in discrete sequences using Java. The algorithm employs a hash table to keep track of the frequency of each element in the sequence, enabling efficient retrieval and comparison of counts.

**Algorithm**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty hash table and iterate through the sequence, adding each element as a key with an initial count of 0.

2. **Frequency Tracking:** As the sequence is traversed, increment the count associated with each key in the hash table.

3. **Checking Well-Repetition:** After processing the entire sequence, iterate through the hash table. If any key has a count less than 2, the sequence is not well-repetition. Otherwise, the sequence is well-repetition.
