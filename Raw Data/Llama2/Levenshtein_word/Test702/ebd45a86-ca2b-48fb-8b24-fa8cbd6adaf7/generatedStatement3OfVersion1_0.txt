This makes testing more systematic and repeatable, especially as your program becomes more complex.  Remember to add the JUnit library to your project if you choose this approach.


Key Improvements in the code:

* **`input.close()`:** Closing the `Scanner` prevents resource leaks.
* **`3.0` instead of `3`:** Ensures floating-point division for more accurate results.
* **Test Cases:**  Provides comprehensive testing to validate correctness.
* **JUnit Example:** Shows how to automate tests for better development practices.
