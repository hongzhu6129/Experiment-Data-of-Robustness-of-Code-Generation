Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles empty strings and `null` input.
* **Clearer return value:** Returns the null character (`\0`) for empty/null input, which is a more standard way to indicate no result.
* **More efficient:** Uses `getOrDefault` for slightly better performance with the `HashMap`.
* **Comprehensive testing:** Includes tests in `main` to demonstrate handling of different inputs, including edge cases.


This revised code provides a more robust and complete solution to the problem.  It's also better styled and easier to understand.
