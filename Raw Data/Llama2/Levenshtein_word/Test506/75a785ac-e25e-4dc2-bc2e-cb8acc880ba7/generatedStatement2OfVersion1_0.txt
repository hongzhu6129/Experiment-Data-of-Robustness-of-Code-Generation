Key improvements in this version:

- **Clarity and Readability:** The code is now more concise and easier to understand. Comments explain the logic.
- **Efficiency:** Using `StringBuilder` for string manipulation is more efficient than repeated string concatenation, especially for larger column numbers.
- **Correctness:** The `n--` adjustment ensures accurate conversion for all inputs, including edge cases like 26, 52, etc.
- **Comprehensive Testing:**  The `main` method provides several test cases to verify the functionality for different input values, including larger ones.


How it works:

1. **`StringBuilder`:** We use a `StringBuilder` to build the column title character by character.
2. **Modulo and Integer Division:** Inside the `while` loop, we calculate the remainder (`n % 26`) to get the current character's index (0-25). We then convert this index to a character by adding 'A'.
3. **Prepend Character:**  We use `sb.insert(0, ch)` to insert the calculated character at the *beginning* of the `StringBuilder`. This is crucial because the column title is built from right to left.
4. **Integer Division:** We divide `n` by 26 to move to the next character position.
5. **Repeat:** The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.



This revised version addresses the efficiency concerns and edge cases of the previous version, providing a more robust and correct solution.
