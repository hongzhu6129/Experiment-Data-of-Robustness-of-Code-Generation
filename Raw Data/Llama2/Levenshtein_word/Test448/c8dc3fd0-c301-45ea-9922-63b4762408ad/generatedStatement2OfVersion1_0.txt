Improvements in this version:

- **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle `NumberFormatException` if the user inputs an invalid binary string. This makes the code more robust.
- **Resource Management:** Closes the `Scanner` using `scanner.close()` to prevent resource leaks.
- **Clear Explanation:**  Provides an educational explanation of the binary-to-hexadecimal conversion process with a step-by-step example, making the code more suitable for a learning exercise.
- **Uppercase Hex Output:** Uses `toUpperCase()` to ensure the hexadecimal output is in uppercase (which is the more conventional representation).
- **Clear Prompts and Output:**  Improves user prompts and output messages for better readability.
