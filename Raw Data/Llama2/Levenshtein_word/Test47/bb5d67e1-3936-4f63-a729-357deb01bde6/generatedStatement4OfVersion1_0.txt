   Then check the content of `face.txt`.

4. **Integration Test (If part of a larger system):** If `printFace()` is a component of a larger program, create integration tests that verify how this face printing integrates and interacts with the other components.  For example, imagine a game where different faces are printed based on events � you'd test those scenarios.


**Corner Cases (N/A):**

There aren't true corner cases for this simple example.  "Corner cases" usually arise where input values can cause unexpected behavior.  This program takes no input.  However, if we were to generalize the program to print different types of faces (happy, sad, etc.) based on an input parameter, then you would have corner cases like:

* **Invalid Input:**  What if the input is not one of the recognized face types?  How should the program handle this?
* **Null Input:** What if the input parameter is null?
* **Boundary Conditions:** (If the input were numerical, representing face size, for instance), what are the maximum and minimum allowable sizes?
