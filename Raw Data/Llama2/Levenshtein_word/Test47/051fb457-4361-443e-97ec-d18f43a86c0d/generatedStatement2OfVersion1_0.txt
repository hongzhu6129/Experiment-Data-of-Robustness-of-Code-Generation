**Test Cases:**

1. **Standard Face:**  Input: `":|"`. Expected Output: A face with a neutral expression.
2. **Happy Face:** Input: `":)"`.  Expected Output: A face with a happy expression.
3. **Sad Face:** Input: `":("`. Expected Output: A face with a sad expression.
4. **Empty Face (Corner Case):** Input: `""`.  Expected Output: A face with empty parentheses. This tests how the program handles an empty string.
5. **Single Space Face (Corner Case):** Input: `" "`. Expected Output: A face with a space between the parentheses. This checks handling of whitespace.
6. **Null Face (Corner Case):** Input: `null`. Expected Output: A default face.  This is crucial for robustness.  The program should not crash with a `NullPointerException`.
7. **Winking Face:** Input: `":-)"` Expected Output: A face with a winking happy expression
8. **Other expression:** Input: `":-("` Expected Output: A face with a more pronounced sad expression.
9. **Big Grin** Input: `":D"` Expected Output: A face with a wide grin.




**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Handles `null` input:**  The code now explicitly checks for `null` input and provides a default face in that case, preventing a `NullPointerException`.
* **Clearer Output:** Consistent spacing and formatting makes the faces look better.
* **More Test Cases:** Added corner cases (empty string, single space, and `null`) to ensure the program is robust.  Also added tests for other kinds of facial expressions to show flexibility.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the purpose of the code and the test cases.


This improved version is more robust, handles edge cases correctly, and produces more consistent output.  The comprehensive test cases demonstrate its functionality and help verify its correctness.
