Key improvements:

* **Input Validation:**  Checks if the start year is greater than the end year and handles it gracefully.
* **Clearer Prompts:** Uses more descriptive prompts for user input.
* **Resource Management:** Closes the `Scanner` to release resources.
* **Correct Calculation:**  Iterates from the start year *up to* (but not including) the end year to count the days correctly.
* **Concise Code:** Uses the ternary operator in `number_of_days` for a more compact representation.
* **Adherence to specified method signatures.** This code adheres to the requirement to only use `main`, `number_of_days`, and `is_Leap_Year`.
