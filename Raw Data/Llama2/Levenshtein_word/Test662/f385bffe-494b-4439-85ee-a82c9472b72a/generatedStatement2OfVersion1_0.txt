Key explanations:

1. **`Collections.reverseOrder()`:** This is the simplest and most recommended way to create a max `PriorityQueue`. It provides a ready-made `Comparator` that reverses the natural ordering of elements.

2. **Custom `Comparator` (Lambda):**  You can use a lambda expression to define a custom `Comparator`. `(a, b) -> b - a` reverses the natural ordering (which is `a - b`).

3. **Custom `Comparator` (Separate Class):**  This method is more verbose but demonstrates the underlying mechanism clearly. You create a class that implements the `Comparator` interface and override the `compare()` method.

4. **Strings Example:**  The example with strings demonstrates how `Collections.reverseOrder()` works with non-numeric types.  Strings are ordered lexicographically (alphabetical order) by default.  `reverseOrder()` reverses this to give reverse alphabetical order.


This educational example provides multiple approaches, making it easier for learners to understand how to create a max `PriorityQueue` in Java.  It's important to emphasize that using `Collections.reverseOrder()` is generally the preferred method due to its conciseness and clarity.
