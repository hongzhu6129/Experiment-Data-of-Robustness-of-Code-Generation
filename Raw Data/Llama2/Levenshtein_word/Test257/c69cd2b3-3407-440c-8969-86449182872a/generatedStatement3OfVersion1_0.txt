**Explanation of changes and improvements:**

* **Methods for Calculation:** The code now uses separate methods (`calculatePerimeter` and `calculateArea`) to improve code organization and reusability.
* **Scanner for Input (Optional):**  The code includes a `Scanner` to get user input for the radius.  You can comment this out and hardcode the radius if you prefer. Remember to close the scanner after use with `input.close();`
* **Test Cases:**  Comprehensive test cases are provided to ensure the code works correctly under different conditions.
* **Error Handling:** The code demonstrates how to handle invalid input (negative radius) by either throwing an exception or returning `Double.NaN`. Choose the approach that best suits your needs.
* **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted to clearly label the perimeter and area.



This improved version is more robust, organized, and easier to test.  Remember to choose the error-handling approach (exception or `NaN`) that best fits your overall program design.
