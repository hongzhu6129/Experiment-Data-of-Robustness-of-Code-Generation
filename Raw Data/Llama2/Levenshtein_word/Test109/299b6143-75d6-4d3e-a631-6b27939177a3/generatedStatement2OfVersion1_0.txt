Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Sophisticated Object:**  The code now includes a `SophisticatedObject` class as a placeholder for your real-world complex objects. This demonstrates how to search based on object properties. Replace this with your own class and adjust the search methods accordingly.

2. **Helper Search Methods:**  The `searchByName` and `searchById` methods encapsulate the search logic, making the `main` method cleaner and more readable. This is good practice for code organization.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly indicates whether an object was found or not, and it prints the properties of the found object.

4. **Generic List:**  Using `List<SophisticatedObject>` makes the code more adaptable to different List implementations (ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.).

5. **Error Handling (Null Check):** The search methods return `null` if the object is not found, and the `main` method handles this `null` case to prevent `NullPointerExceptions`.

6. **Comments and Explanations:** Added more comments and explanations throughout the code for better understanding.


How to Adapt for your own "Sophisticated" Object:

1. **Replace `SophisticatedObject`:** Replace the `SophisticatedObject` class with your own class definition.
2. **Modify Search Methods:** Update the `searchByName`, `searchById` (or create new search methods like `searchByOtherProperty`) to access the relevant properties of *your* sophisticated object.
3. **Adjust `main` method:**  Update the `main` method to create instances of *your* objects and call the appropriate search methods.
