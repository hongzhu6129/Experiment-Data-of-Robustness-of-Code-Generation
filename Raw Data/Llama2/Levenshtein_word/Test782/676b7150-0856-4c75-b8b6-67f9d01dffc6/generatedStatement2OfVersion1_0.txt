Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  Improved variable names (like `prime` instead of `isPrime`) and comments make the code easier to understand.
* **Efficiency:** The outer loop now only iterates up to the square root of `n` (`p * p <= n`). This is a standard optimization for the Sieve of Eratosthenes, as any number greater than the square root must have a factor less than or equal to its square root.
* **Correctness:** The inner loop now starts marking multiples of `p` from `p * p`, not from `2 * p`. This avoids re-marking numbers that have already been marked.
* **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code now correctly handles the case when `n` is small (e.g., 0, 1, 2).
* **Clean Output:** The output is formatted neatly with a clear message indicating the upper limit.
