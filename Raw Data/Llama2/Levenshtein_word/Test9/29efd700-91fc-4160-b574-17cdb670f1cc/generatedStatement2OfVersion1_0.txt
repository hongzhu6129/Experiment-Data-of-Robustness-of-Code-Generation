**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Node Class:**  A `Node` class is defined to represent the nodes of the binary tree. Each node holds an integer value (`data`) and references to its left and right children.

2. **Recursive `maxDepth` Function:**
   - **Base Case:** If the `root` is `null` (empty tree or end of a branch), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  Recursively calculate the depth of the left subtree (`leftDepth`) and the right subtree (`rightDepth`).
   - **Return Maximum + 1:**  The maximum depth of the current node's subtree is the maximum of its children's depths, plus 1 (to account for the current node).

3. **`main` Method with Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates how to create a binary tree, call the `maxDepth` function, and print the result.  I've included multiple tree examples, including an empty tree case, to show how the code handles various scenarios.

4. **Clearer Comments:** I've added comments to explain the logic within the code.


This improved version is more concise, efficient, and easier to understand. It adheres to the specified method signatures while correctly calculating the maximum depth of a binary tree.
