**Test cases:**

* **Empty string:** ""
* **String with only one character:** "a"

* **String with empty spaces:** "a b c"
* **String in different case:** "ABC"
* **String with special characters:** "!@#$$%^&"

**Corner cases:**

* **String with only one character:** The program should return the character itself.
* **String with all characters the same:** The program should return the entire string.
* **String with repeated characters:** The program should return the longest substring that contains only the applicable characters sequence.
* **String with non-alphabetic characters:** The program should ignore the non-alphabetic characters.
* **String with empty spaces:** The program should ignore the empty spaces.
* **String in different case:** The program should ignore the case of the characters.
* **String with special characters:** The program should ignore the special characters.
