**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **HashSet for Cycle Detection:** The `isHappy_number` method uses a `HashSet` called `seen` to store the numbers encountered during the process.  This efficiently detects cycles. If a number is already in `seen`, it means we're in a loop, and the number is not happy.

2. **Clearer Loop Condition:** The `while` loop condition `n != 1 && !seen.contains(n)` is more concise and easier to understand. It continues as long as the number is not 1 and we haven't encountered it before.

3. **Helper Function:** The `sumOfSquaresOfDigits` function is a separate helper function to calculate the sum of the squares of digits, making the code more organized and readable.

4. **Main Method with Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `isHappy_number` function with a couple of example numbers. It also includes the test cases provided in the original prompt, so you can see the correct outputs.


This improved version is more efficient, easier to read, and handles potential infinite loops correctly. It also adheres to the requested method signatures.
