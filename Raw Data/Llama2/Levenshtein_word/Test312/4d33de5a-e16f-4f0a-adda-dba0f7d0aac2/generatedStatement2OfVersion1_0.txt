**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Efficiency:** The code includes optimizations to avoid unnecessary calculations:
   - `if (a3 > n) break;`: Stops the outer loop if `a^3` exceeds `n`, as no sum can be less than or equal to `n`.
   - `if (sum > n) break;`: Stops the inner loop if `a^3 + b^3` exceeds `n`.
   - `if (c3 > sum) break;`: Stops the innermost loop if `c^3` exceeds the current sum.

2. **Duplicate Avoidance:** The inner loop for `b` starts from `a + 1` to avoid checking duplicate pairs (e.g., 1^3 + 2^3 is the same as 2^3 + 1^3).

3. **Integer Cube Root Check:** The code now accurately checks that the cube root (`d`) is a positive integer using `Math.round(Math.cbrt(d3))` and `d*d*d == d3 && d>0`. This avoids issues with floating-point precision that can arise when calculating cube roots directly.


4. **Clarity:** Variable names and comments are improved for better readability.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. Compile: `javac Ramanujan.java`
3. Run: `java Ramanujan`


This improved version is more efficient, accurate, and easier to understand. You can change the value of `n` to search for Ramanujan numbers up to a different limit.
