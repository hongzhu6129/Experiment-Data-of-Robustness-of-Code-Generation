**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Node Class:**  A `Node` class is defined to represent the structure of a binary tree node.  It has `data`, `left` (left child), and `right` (right child) members.

2. **Recursive `maxDepth()`:** The core logic resides in the `maxDepth()` method:
   - **Base Case:** If the `root` is `null` (empty tree or we've reached the end of a branch), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  We recursively calculate the depth of the left subtree (`leftDepth`) and the right subtree (`rightDepth`).  The maximum of these two depths + 1 (for the current node itself) is the maximum depth of the tree rooted at the current node.

3. **`main()` Method with Test Cases:** The `main()` method creates a sample binary tree and calls `maxDepth()` to demonstrate the functionality. I have included three test cases: a general binary tree, an empty tree, and a skewed tree to ensure the code handles various scenarios correctly.

4. **Clearer Output:**  The output now clearly indicates "Height of tree is: " to make the results easy to interpret.


This revised version is more robust, well-commented, and demonstrates good coding practices, making it easier to understand and maintain.
