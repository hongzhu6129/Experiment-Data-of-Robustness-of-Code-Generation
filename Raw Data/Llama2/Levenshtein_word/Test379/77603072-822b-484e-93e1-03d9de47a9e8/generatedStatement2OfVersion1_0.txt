**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Empty and Null Arrays:** The code now explicitly handles cases where the input array is `null` or empty, preventing potential `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` errors.

2. **In-Place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` method modifies the input array in-place. It overwrites duplicate elements with unique ones, effectively shrinking the array from the beginning.

3. **Returns Updated Length:** The method correctly returns the length of the updated array (the number of unique elements).

4. **Clearer Main Method:** The `main` method provides multiple test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs, including edge cases like empty and `null` arrays.  It also uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant part of the modified array (up to the updated length). This avoids displaying the "garbage" values that remain beyond the updated length.
5. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic, especially the crucial parts of the algorithm.



This improved version addresses the issues present in earlier responses, providing a robust and efficient solution that aligns with best coding practices.
