This code efficiently generates Hamming numbers by maintaining separate indices (i2, i3, i5) for multiples of 2, 3, and 5, respectively. In each iteration, it finds the smallest of the next multiples and adds it to the `hamming` array.  The indices are then updated accordingly to avoid duplicates and ensure that the next multiples are calculated correctly.
