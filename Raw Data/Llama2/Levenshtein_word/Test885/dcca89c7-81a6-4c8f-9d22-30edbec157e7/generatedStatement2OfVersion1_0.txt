**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Positive Numbers:**
   - Input: 10, 20, 30
   - Expected Output: 20.0

2. **Negative Numbers:**
   - Input: -10, -20, -30
   - Expected Output: -20.0

3. **Mixed Positive and Negative Numbers:**
   - Input: -10, 20, 30
   - Expected Output: 13.333333333333334

4. **Zeroes:**
   - Input: 0, 0, 0
   - Expected Output: 0.0

5. **Large Numbers:**
   - Input: 1000000, 2000000, 3000000
   - Expected Output: 2000000.0


6. **Small Numbers (Close to zero):**
   - Input: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
   - Expected Output: 0.2

7. **Combination of Integer and Decimal Input (though the program takes integers, it's good to validate handling with user input):**  If a user enters decimal numbers, the `nextInt()` method will throw an `InputMismatchException`. You might want to enhance the program to handle this more gracefully by using `nextDouble()` and casting to `int` if needed or providing an error message to the user.

8. **Integer Overflow (Corner Case):**  
   - Input: Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE
   - This will likely result in an incorrect average due to integer overflow during the sum calculation. Using `long` for the sum would mitigate this but may still have limitations.



**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You can either manually enter the inputs when prompted by the program or modify the `main` method to automatically run these tests:
