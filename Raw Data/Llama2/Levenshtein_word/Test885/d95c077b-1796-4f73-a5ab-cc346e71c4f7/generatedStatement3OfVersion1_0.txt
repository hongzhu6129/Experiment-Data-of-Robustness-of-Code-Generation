Make sure you have JUnit set up in your project to run these tests.  The assertions (`assertEquals`) check if the actual result from `calculateAverage` matches the expected value.


This provides a more robust approach to verifying the correctness of your `AverageCalculator` program. Remember to test thoroughly, including edge and corner cases, to ensure your program is reliable and works as expected in all situations.
