**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Honeycomb Number Definition:** Honeycomb numbers are defined by the formula  `n^3 - (n-1)^3`.  The provided prompt incorrectly referred to cube numbers (n*n*n).  This code uses the correct honeycomb formula.

2. **Efficient Check:** The code efficiently checks for honeycomb numbers by iterating through possible 'n' values.  It calculates the honeycomb number for each 'n' and compares it with the input.

3. **Early Exit:**  The code includes early exit conditions:
   - If a match is found, the program prints "Number is a honeycomb." and immediately exits using `return;`.
   - If the calculated honeycomb number becomes greater than the input `num`, it means the input is not a honeycomb number, so it prints "Number is not a honeycomb." and exits. This prevents unnecessary calculations.

4. **Clear Output:** The output messages clearly state whether the input number is a honeycomb number or not.

5. **User Input:** The code uses `Scanner` to take user input, making it interactive.
