Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The `isCube` method now correctly handles negative numbers. The cube of a negative number is also negative. The logic is simplified by recursively calling `isCube` with the absolute value if the input is negative.

2. **More Efficient Calculation:** Instead of iterating to find the cube root, the code uses `Math.cbrt()` to directly compute the cube root.  This is a much more efficient approach.

3. **Integer Cube Root Check:** The code rounds the cube root to the nearest integer using `Math.round()` and then checks if the cube of this integer root is equal to the original number.  This robustly handles cases where `Math.cbrt()` might return a value very close to an integer due to floating-point limitations.

4. **Clearer Output:** The output messages are more informative ("Number is a cube" or "Number is not a cube").

5. **`main` Method for Testing:** The provided `main` method demonstrates how to use the `isCube` method with sample input.  You would typically replace the hardcoded value with user input if you were building a full application.
