**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Input Handling:** The code now checks if a command-line argument is provided. If not, it prints a helpful message and exits gracefully.  It also includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the input is not a valid integer.
2. **Cube Root Calculation:** It uses `Math.cbrt()` to calculate the cube root directly. This is more efficient and accurate than iterating through possible cube roots.
3. **Rounding:** `Math.round()` is used to round the cube root to the nearest integer. This addresses the issue of floating-point precision when dealing with cube roots of large numbers.
4. **Clear Output:** The output messages are more informative ("Number is a cube" or "Number is not a cube").
5. **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block prevents the program from crashing if the user enters non-numeric input.


**How to run from the command line:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CubeChecker.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:
