**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The `isCube` method now correctly handles negative numbers.  The cube of a negative number is negative, so we check the absolute value and adjust the result accordingly.

2. **Efficiency:** Instead of iterating or using floating-point arithmetic with `Math.pow`, we calculate the integer cube root efficiently using `Math.cbrt` and round it to the nearest integer. This avoids potential precision issues with floating-point calculations.

3. **Clarity and Readability:** The code is well-commented and uses descriptive variable names.

4. **Testability (though not asked for):**  The core logic is separated into the `isCube` function, making it easier to test independently.  (While this question asked for only `main`, good practice is to separate logic for future development.)

**How to get user input within `main`:**

If you need actual user input, you can use the `Scanner` class:
