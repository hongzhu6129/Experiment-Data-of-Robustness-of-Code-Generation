**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Output:** The code now prints the numbers 1 through `n` for each row in the matrix, making the output more visually representative of a matrix.
2. **`main` method for demonstration:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `printMatrix` method with different values of `n`.
3. **Handles n = 0:** The code correctly handles the case where `n` is 0 (prints nothing, representing an empty matrix). 
4. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the purpose of the `printMatrix` method and the example usage in `main`.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Solution.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Compile the code using the Java compiler:
