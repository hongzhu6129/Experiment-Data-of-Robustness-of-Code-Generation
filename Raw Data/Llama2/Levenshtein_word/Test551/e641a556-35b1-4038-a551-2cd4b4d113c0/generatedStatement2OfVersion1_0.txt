**Explanation using TreeMap:**

* **TreeMap:** `TreeMap` in Java is a sorted map implementation based on a red-black tree.  This is the most efficient way to solve this problem because it maintains the keys in sorted order, allowing for quick retrieval of the least key greater than or equal to a given key.

* **ceilingKey(K key):**  The `ceilingKey()` method of the `TreeMap` class directly returns the least key greater than or equal to the given `key`. If no such key is found, it returns `null`.  

This approach is significantly more efficient than manually iterating through a collection, especially for large datasets, as the `TreeMap`'s underlying tree structure provides logarithmic time complexity for the `ceilingKey()` operation.
