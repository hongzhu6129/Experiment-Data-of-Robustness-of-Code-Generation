**Test Cases and Corner Cases:**

1. **Empty File:** `/home/students/abc.txt` (Create an empty file named abc.txt). Expected output: 0 bytes.

2. **Regular File:** `/home/students/test.txt` (Create a file with some content).  Expected output: The actual size of the file in bytes.

3. **Non-existent File:** `nonexistent_file.txt`. Expected output: An error message indicating the file was not found and a size of -1.

4. **Empty File Path:** `""`. Expected output:  An error message (most likely an InvalidPathException) and -1.

5. **Null File Path:** `null`.  Expected output:  A `NullPointerException` caught by the try-catch block, an error message, and -1.

6. **Very Large File:** `/path/to/very/large/file.txt`. (If possible, create a very large file, several GBs, to test how the `Files.size()` method handles it.  This tests for potential integer overflow issues if you were using older, less robust file size methods).

7. **Directory (Not a File):** `/path/to/a/directory` (Create a directory). Expected output: An error message (likely a `IOException: Is a directory`) and -1.  This is important to test because attempting to get the "size" of a directory doesn't make sense in the same way as a file.

**Key Improvements in this Code:**

* **Error Handling:**  Uses a try-catch block to handle `IOExceptions`, which can occur if the file doesn't exist, there are permissions issues, or other I/O problems arise.
* **Returns -1 on Error:** The function returns -1 to clearly indicate that there was an error in getting the file size.  This makes it easier for the calling code to handle errors.
* **Uses `Files.size()`:**  Uses the `Files.size()` method from the `java.nio.file` package. This method is generally more efficient and robust for getting file sizes, especially for large files, compared to older approaches.
* **Clearer Output:** The output now includes the file path along with the size or error message, making it easier to understand the results of each test case.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Covers a good range of scenarios, including corner cases like empty paths, null paths, and directories.


Remember to replace the example file paths with valid paths on your system and create the necessary files and directories for testing.
