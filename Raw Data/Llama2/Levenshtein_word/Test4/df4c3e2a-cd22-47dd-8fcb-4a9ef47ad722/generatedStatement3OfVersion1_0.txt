3. **Closing the Scanner:** It's good practice to close the `Scanner` when you're finished with it to release system resources.  I've added `scanner.close();`.

4. **Clearer Variable Names (Minor):** While `str1` is okay, a more descriptive variable name like `inputString` or `userString` would improve readability.


**How to Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.java` file (e.g., `FirstThreeChars.java`).
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler: `javac FirstThreeChars.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code: `java FirstThreeChars`

The program will then prompt you to enter a string.
