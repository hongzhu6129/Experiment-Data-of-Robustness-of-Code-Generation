Key improvements in this version:

- **Clearer Interval Class:** The `Interval` class is now self-contained and more readable.
- **Comparator for Sorting:** Uses a `Comparator` with `Collections.sort()` for cleaner sorting logic based on start times.
- **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes checks for `null` or empty input lists.
- **Correct Merging Logic:** Ensures correct merging even when an interval completely encompasses another (e.g., [1, 5] and [2, 3]).
- **Adds Last Interval:**  Correctly adds the last processed interval to the `mergedIntervals` list after the loop.
- **Example Usage in `main`:** Demonstrates how to use the `merge` function.
- **toString() method in Interval:** Provides a convenient way to print the intervals.



This revised code adheres to the specified method signatures and provides a more robust and understandable solution to the merging intervals problem.
