Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `prime` instead of `p` for the boolean array makes the code more readable.
* **Concise Comments:** Comments are streamlined to explain the logic without being overly verbose.
* **Efficient Prime Collection:** The prime numbers are collected into an array directly after the sieve is complete, avoiding unnecessary iterations.
* **Output Formatting:** A newline character is added at the end of the output for cleaner presentation.
* **Example Usage:** The `main` method provides a clear example of how to use the `generatePrimes` function.


This revised code is more efficient, readable, and adheres to best practices, making it a better solution overall.
