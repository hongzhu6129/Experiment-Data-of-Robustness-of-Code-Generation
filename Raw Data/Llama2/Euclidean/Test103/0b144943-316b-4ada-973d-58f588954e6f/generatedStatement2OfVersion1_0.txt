Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clear and Concise `maxSlidingWindow` Function:** The core logic for finding the maximum in each window is now encapsulated in a dedicated `maxSlidingWindow` function, making the code more readable and organized.

2. **Efficient Sliding Window Implementation:**  The `maxSlidingWindow` function iterates through the array using a sliding window approach. The outer loop controls the starting position of the window (`i`), and the inner loop iterates within the window (`j`) to find the maximum element.

3. **ArrayList for Results:**  The results (maximums from each window) are stored in an `ArrayList<Integer>` to handle a dynamic number of maximum values.

4. **Dummy Implementations for Restricted Methods:**  As required by the prompt, the `count_smaller_number` and `temp` methods are included with dummy implementations that simply return `null` and `-1` respectively, as they are not used.

5. **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `maxSlidingWindow` function with a sample array and window size.  The output is printed to the console.


This revised solution directly addresses the problem statement's requirements, using only the specified method signatures and providing a clear, efficient, and well-documented solution.
