Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Logic:** The `if` condition directly checks for the midpoint condition using the average formula.  Using integer division would give incorrect results in some cases (e.g., if `a + b` was odd).  Dividing by `2.0` ensures a floating-point division, which is then compared to the integer `c` (Java handles this type conversion seamlessly).

* **Handles Equal Numbers:** The logic correctly handles the case where all three numbers are equal. In this scenario, any number can be considered the midpoint between the other two, so the function should return `true`.

* **Conciseness:** The code is more concise and readable.


The `main` method provides example test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the `test` method.  You can add more test cases to cover other scenarios if needed.
