Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:** It correctly handles `null` and empty arrays to avoid `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
* **Clearer logic:** The comparison logic is separated into a helper function, making the `main` method more readable.
* **More test cases:** Includes tests with empty, single-element, and `null` arrays to demonstrate robustness.
* **Concise and efficient:**  The code is more compact and avoids unnecessary checks.


This improved version addresses potential issues and provides a more robust and reliable solution.
