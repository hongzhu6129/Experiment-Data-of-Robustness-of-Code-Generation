**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles empty arrays and single-element arrays correctly.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueCount` is used instead of `j`  to make the code more readable.

3. **In-Place Modification:**  The `removeDuplicates` function modifies the input array `nums` in-place to store the unique elements at the beginning.

4. **Returns the Length:** The function returns the length of the updated array (the number of unique elements), which is the required output according to the problem description.

5. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** The `main` method includes several test cases, including edge cases (empty and single-element arrays), to demonstrate the function's correctness.

6. **Output Clarity:** The `main` method now uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` and `Arrays.toString` to print only the relevant part of the modified array (the unique elements) to avoid showing the leftover duplicate values.


This improved version is more robust, efficient, and adheres better to common Java coding practices.  It correctly addresses the problem description's requirements and provides more informative output.
