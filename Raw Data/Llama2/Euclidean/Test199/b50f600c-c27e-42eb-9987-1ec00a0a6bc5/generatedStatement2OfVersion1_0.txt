This improved code provides two ways to replace elements:

1. **Using `set(index, element)`:**  This is the simplest way if you know the index of the element you want to replace.  The code now includes a check to make sure the index is valid to prevent `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. **Using a `ListIterator`:**  This method is more flexible if you want to replace an element based on its value rather than its index.  It also allows you to replace multiple occurrences if needed (just remove the `break` statement in the loop).  The example shows how to replace the first occurrence of a specific book title.
