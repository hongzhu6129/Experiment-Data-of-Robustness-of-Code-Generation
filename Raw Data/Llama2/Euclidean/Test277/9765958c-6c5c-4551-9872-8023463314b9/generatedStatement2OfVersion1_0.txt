Key improvements and explanations:

* **JUnit Tests:**  The code now includes comprehensive JUnit tests to verify the correctness of the `getArea()` and `getPerimeter()` methods.  This is crucial for robust code.
* **Corner Cases:** The tests cover important corner cases:
    * Zero length and zero width.
    * Negative length and width (although you might want to throw an exception in these cases in production code).
    * A square (a special case of a rectangle).
* **Large Number Test:** A test case with large numbers helps check for potential overflow problems.
* **Clearer Output:** The `main` method now produces more descriptive output for each rectangle example.
* **Error Handling (Optional):** In a real-world application, you should consider adding error handling (e.g., throwing exceptions) if the length or width provided to the constructor are negative or zero, as these are usually considered invalid inputs for a rectangle.



How to run the tests:

1. **IDE:** If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you can right-click the `RectangleTest` class and select "Run 'RectangleTest'".
2. **Command Line:**  Compile and run from the command line:
