Key improvements:

- **Clearer Comments:** Added more explanatory comments within the `removeDuplicates` method to clarify the logic.
- **Comprehensive `main` method:** Included test cases with different scenarios (duplicates, empty array, null array, already unique array) to demonstrate how the function works.
- **Output Formatting:**  The `main` method now prints the updated array length and the actual updated array using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid showing the unmodified portion of the original array.
- **Handles Edge Cases:** The code correctly handles empty and null input arrays.
- **Efficiency:**  The algorithm is efficient (O(n) time complexity) as it iterates through the array only once.



This improved version is more educational, robust, and clearly demonstrates the functionality of the `removeDuplicates` method.
