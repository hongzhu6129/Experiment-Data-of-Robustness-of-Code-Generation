Key improvements and explanations:

1. **HashSet for Cycle Detection:**  The `HashSet` called `seen` is crucial.  It stores the numbers encountered during the process. If we encounter a number that's already in `seen`, we know we're in a cycle, and the number is not happy.  This prevents infinite loops.

2. **Clearer Loop Condition:** The `while` loop condition `n != 1 && !seen.contains(n)` is concise and expresses the two stopping conditions: reaching 1 (happy) or entering a cycle (unhappy).

3. **Efficient Digit Extraction:** The inner `while` loop efficiently extracts digits using the modulo operator (`%`) and integer division (`/`).

4. **Concise Return:**  The final `return n == 1;` is straightforward and directly answers whether the number is happy.

5. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `isHappy_number` function and prints clear output. I've added examples with both happy and unhappy numbers.


This improved version addresses the potential infinite loop issue, uses a `HashSet` efficiently, and is more readable and maintainable.
