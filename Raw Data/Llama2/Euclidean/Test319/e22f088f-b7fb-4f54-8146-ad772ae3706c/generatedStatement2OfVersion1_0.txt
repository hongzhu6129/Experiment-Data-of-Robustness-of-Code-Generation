**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Kadane's Algorithm:** The core logic employs Kadane's algorithm, which is an efficient dynamic programming approach to find the subarray with the minimum (or maximum) sum in O(n) time complexity.

2. **Handles Empty or Null Input:** The code now includes a check for `null` or empty input `ArrayList`.  This prevents `NullPointerException` or `IndexOutOfBoundsException` and allows you to define a specific return value (0 in this case) or throw an exception as needed.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** Variable names like `minSoFar` and `currentMin` enhance readability and make the logic easier to follow.

4. **Example Usage in `main()`:** The `main()` method provides several test cases demonstrating how to use the `min_SubArray()` method with different inputs, including single-element arrays.  The outputs for these examples are also provided in the comments.

5. **Detailed Comments:** Comments are added to explain the steps and logic within the `min_SubArray()` method, making the code more understandable.


This improved version is more robust, efficient, and easier to understand and maintain. It effectively finds the minimum sum subarray using Kadane's algorithm and handles edge cases appropriately.
