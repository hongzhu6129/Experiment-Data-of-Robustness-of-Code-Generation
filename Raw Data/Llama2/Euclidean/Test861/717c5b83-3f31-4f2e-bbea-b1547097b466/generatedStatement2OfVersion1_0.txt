This code directly addresses the prompt's requirement of using only the `public static void main(String[])` signature for the program entry point.  It neatly separates the printing logic into a helper function `printBooleanArray` within the same class, avoiding cluttering the `main` method. This approach improves code organization and readability.  The `printBooleanArray` method iterates through the 2D array using enhanced for loops (for-each loops) and prints 't' or 'f' based on the boolean value.
