This code demonstrates two ways to add elements from one `PriorityQueue` to another:

1. **`addAll()` method:** This is the most concise and efficient method.  It adds all elements from the first queue (`pq1`) to the second queue (`pq2`), maintaining the priority order in `pq2`.

2. **Iterative method:** This method iterates through the first queue and adds each element individually to the second queue. This is less efficient than `addAll()` but helps illustrate the process.

The code also includes an important note explaining how to effectively *move* all elements if that's the desired outcome (by clearing the source queue after adding its elements to the destination). The example uses integers, but `PriorityQueue` can work with any comparable data type (or you can provide a custom `Comparator`).
