        int[] arr1 = {20, 5, 20, 10, 20}; // Valid
        int[] arr2 = {20, 20, 5, 20, 10}; // Invalid (adjacent 20s)
        int[] arr3 = {20, 5, 10, 20}; // Invalid (only two 20s)
        int[] arr4 = {20, 5, 20, 20, 20}; // Invalid (too many 20s and adjacent)
        int[] arr5 = {1,2,3,4,5};  // Invalid (no 20s)

        System.out.println("Array 1: " + check20s(arr1));
        System.out.println("Array 2: " + check20s(arr2));
        System.out.println("Array 3: " + check20s(arr3));
        System.out.println("Array 4: " + check20s(arr4));

        boolean adjacent = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == 20) {
                count++;
                if (i > 0 && arr[i - 1] == 20) {
                    adjacent = true;
                    break; // No need to continue if adjacent 20s are found
                }

Explanation:

1. **`check20s(int[] arr)` method:**
   - Takes an integer array `arr` as input.
   - Initializes `count` to track the number of 20s and `adjacent` to track if any 20s are next to each other (both initially false).
   - Iterates through the array:
     - If an element is 20, increment `count`.
     - If an element is 20 AND the previous element was also 20, set `adjacent` to `true` and `break` the loop (no need to continue checking).
   - Returns `true` if and only if `count` is exactly 3 AND `adjacent` is `false` (meaning no adjacent 20s were found).  Otherwise, it returns `false`.

2. **`main(String[] args)` method:**
   - Creates several test arrays to demonstrate different scenarios.
   - Calls `check20s()` for each array and prints the result.


Key improvements in this version:

- **Clarity and Readability:** The code is well-formatted and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive (`count`, `adjacent`).
- **Efficiency:** The loop breaks early if adjacent 20s are found, avoiding unnecessary iterations.
- **Correctness:** It accurately handles all the required conditions (exactly three 20s, no adjacent 20s).
- **Testability:**  The `main` method provides clear test cases to verify the function's behavior.
