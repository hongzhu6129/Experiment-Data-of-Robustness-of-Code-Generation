**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input | Expected Output |
|---|---|---|
| Positive Even | 10 | 10 is even. |
| Positive Odd | 7 | 7 is not even (odd). |
| Zero | 0 | 0 is even. |
| Negative Even | -8 | -8 is even. |
| Negative Odd | -15 | -15 is not even (odd). |
| Large Positive Even | 2147483646 (Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1)  | 2147483646 is even. | // Corner case: near maximum positive integer
| Large Negative Even| -2147483648 (Integer.MIN_VALUE) | -2147483648 is even. | // Corner case: minimum negative integer
| Large Positive Odd | 2147483647 (Integer.MAX_VALUE)  | 2147483647 is not even (odd). | // Corner case: maximum positive integer
| Large Negative Odd | -2147483647 | -2147483647 is not even (odd). |


**How to run the tests (using JUnit - optional but recommended):**

1. **Add JUnit to your project:** If you are using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, it usually has built-in support for adding JUnit.  If not, you can add the JUnit dependency to your project's build file (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven).

2. **Create a test class:**
