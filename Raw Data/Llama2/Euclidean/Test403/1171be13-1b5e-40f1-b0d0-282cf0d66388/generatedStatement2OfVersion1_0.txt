**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Input Handling:** The code now checks if exactly one argument is provided. It also includes error handling using a `try-catch` block to catch `NumberFormatException` if the input is not a valid integer.

2. **Negative Number Handling:** The `isCube` method now correctly handles negative numbers.  The cube of a negative number is negative.

3. **Efficiency (Binary Search):** The most significant improvement is the use of a binary search algorithm to find the cube root.  This is much more efficient than a simple brute-force loop, especially for larger numbers.  The complexity is O(log n) instead of O(n^(1/3)).

4. **Long for Cube Calculation:** The `cube` variable is now of type `long` to prevent potential overflow when calculating the cube of larger integers.  This is crucial for correctness.

5. **Clearer Output:** The output messages are more informative, indicating whether the number is a cube or not.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CubeChecker.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Compile using the command: `javac CubeChecker.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the program with an integer argument:  `java CubeChecker 8` (or any other number you want to test).



This revised version addresses the shortcomings of previous responses and provides a robust and efficient solution for checking if a number is a perfect cube.
