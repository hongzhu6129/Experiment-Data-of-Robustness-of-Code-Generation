Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Use of 1.0:** The prompt specifically requests to use `1.0` instead of `1` to ensure floating-point division is performed.  This is crucial for accuracy when calculating the approximations.

2. **Clear Output:** The code now prints the results of both approximations with descriptive labels, making the output easier to understand.

3. **Educational Enhancement:**  The added loop and print statements within the loop demonstrate how the value approaches pi as more terms are added to the series.  This provides a better understanding of the underlying mathematical concept.

4. **Correct Series Formula:** The original question had a typo in the formula (a "+" where there should have been a "-").  The corrected code uses the alternating signs:  1 - (1/3) + (1/5) - (1/7) + ...  

5. **Comments:**  Comments have been added to further explain what the code is doing, making it more educational.
