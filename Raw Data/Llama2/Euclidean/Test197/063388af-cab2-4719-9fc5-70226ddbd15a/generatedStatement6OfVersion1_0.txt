   Replace `/path/to/your/file.txt` or `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual path you want to check.

**Key Improvements in this version:**

* **Uses `java.nio.file`:**  This is the modern and preferred way to handle files and paths in Java. It's more robust and efficient than the older `java.io.File` for simple checks like this.
* **Handles Exceptions:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions, such as an invalid path being provided. This prevents the program from crashing and provides a more user-friendly error message.
* **Clearer Output:** The output messages are more informative, indicating whether the path is a directory, a file, or neither.
* **Input Validation:** Checks if a command-line argument has been provided and prints a helpful message if not.

If you must use `java.io.File`, here's the equivalent code:
