**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Coordinates:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -70
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0 
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

4. **Opposite Sides of the Earth (Antipodes):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 110  (180 degrees opposite longitude)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)


5. **Points near the International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 10
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 10
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Distance:  A small distance (because these points are close despite the longitude difference)


6. **Invalid Input (Error Handling - Optional):**
   - lat1: "abc"  (non-numeric)
   - lon1: 10
   - lat2: 20
   - lon2: 30
   - Expected:  Your program should handle this gracefully (e.g., print an error message and exit or prompt for valid input).  Consider adding `try-catch` blocks to handle `InputMismatchException`.



**How to Run Tests:**

You can manually enter these values into your program or, for more automated testing, you could write a separate test class using a testing framework like JUnit.  A simple approach without JUnit would be to create a method to calculate distance and call it with different test values, comparing the result to the expected value.
