**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` inputs, returning 0 in both cases. This makes the function more robust.

2. **Clearer Variable Naming:**  `uniqueIndex` is used instead of just `i` or `j` to clearly indicate the purpose of this variable � tracking the index of the last unique element.

3. **In-Place Modification:** The function modifies the original `nums` array in place, which is a common practice and often more efficient than creating a new array. The unique elements are placed at the beginning of the `nums` array.

4. **Concise Return:**  Returns `uniqueIndex + 1` which directly represents the new length.

5. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** The `main` method provides multiple test cases, including edge cases (empty and null array), demonstrating how the function behaves in different scenarios.  The output is also improved to show both the new length and the modified array (up to the new length) for clarity. It uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid printing the elements beyond the new length.


This revised version is more robust, efficient, and easier to understand due to the clear variable naming, improved error handling, and the illustrative test cases in `main`.
