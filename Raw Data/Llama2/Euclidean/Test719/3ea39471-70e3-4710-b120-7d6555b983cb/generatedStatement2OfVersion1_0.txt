**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Output:** The output now labels each minimum value, making it easier to understand.

2. **"Earliest Date" Clarification:**  The original prompt was slightly ambiguous. There's no "minimum earlier date" field in `Calendar`.  A calendar has a range.  I've demonstrated how to obtain the earliest representable date using `Long.MIN_VALUE`. This gives you the absolute earliest time the `Calendar` class can handle.

3. **`GregorianCalendar`:** Using `GregorianCalendar` is more specific than just `Calendar` and is often what's intended when working with dates.

4. **`Calendar.ERA`**:  I've included `Calendar.ERA` as it is related to representing earlier years (like BCE/BC or CE/AD equivalents) and is a true "minimum" value that the calendar can represent.  Most modern calendar systems won't represent dates prior to 1 CE/AD using negative years. They will use the era instead (e.g. 1 BCE).


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `MinimumCalendarValues.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac MinimumCalendarValues.java`
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program using: `java MinimumCalendarValues`


The output will display the minimum values for the specified fields.
