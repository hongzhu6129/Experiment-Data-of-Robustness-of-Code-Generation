This code takes the binary number as a String input.  We use `Integer.parseInt(binaryNumber, 2)` to convert the binary string to its integer equivalent. The `2` specifies that the input string is in base 2 (binary). Then,  `Integer.toHexString(decimalEquivalent)` converts the integer to its hexadecimal string representation.  The `.toUpperCase()` is added to make the output consistent (e.g., "D" instead of "d").  The `try-catch` block handles potential `NumberFormatException` if the input is not a valid binary string.


If you need to handle very large binary numbers that exceed the capacity of `int`, you would need to use `BigInteger`:
