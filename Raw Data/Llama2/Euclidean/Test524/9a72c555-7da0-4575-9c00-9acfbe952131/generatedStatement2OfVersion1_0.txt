**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner and edge cases:

1. **Lower Boundary (1):**  Check if 1 is correctly *not* printed in any of the lists (it's not divisible by 3, 5, or both).

2. **Upper Boundary (100):** Verify that 100 is printed in the list of numbers divisible by 5, but not in the lists for 3 or both.

3. **Divisible by 3 only:**  Test with a number like 9, ensuring it appears in the list for 3 but not 5 or both.

4. **Divisible by 5 only:** Test with a number like 25, ensuring it appears in the list for 5 but not 3 or both.

5. **Divisible by both 3 and 5:**  Test with a number like 15 or 30, verifying it's printed in all three lists (3, 5, and both).

6. **Numbers around multiples of 15:** Test numbers like 14, 15, and 16 to ensure the program correctly handles the transition around numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.  This helps confirm the logic for "both" isn't accidentally including neighboring numbers.

7. **Zero (if applicable):** While the problem specifies 1 to 100,  if you modified the code to include 0, test 0 as it's divisible by all integers.  (In the current code, 0 isn't checked).


**How to Run Tests (Manually):**

You can visually inspect the output of your program against the expected output based on the test cases.

**How to Automate Tests (Example with JUnit):**  (More advanced, but recommended for larger projects)
