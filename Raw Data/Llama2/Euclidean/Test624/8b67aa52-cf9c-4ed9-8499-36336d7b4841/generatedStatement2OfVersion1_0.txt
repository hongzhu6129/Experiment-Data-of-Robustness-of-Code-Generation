Key improvements in this version:

* **Input Validation:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle `DateTimeParseException`.  This prevents the program from crashing if the user enters dates in the wrong format. It provides a helpful error message instead.
* **Clearer Prompts:** The prompts to the user are more explicit about the expected date format.
* **Scanner Closed:** The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` to release resources.
* **Concise Output:** The output focuses on years and months as requested, making it easier to read.  The days are commented out, but you can uncomment that line if you need them.
* **Modern Date/Time API:** It uses the `java.time` package (introduced in Java 8), which is the recommended way to work with dates and times in modern Java.  It's much better than the old `Date` and `Calendar` classes.
