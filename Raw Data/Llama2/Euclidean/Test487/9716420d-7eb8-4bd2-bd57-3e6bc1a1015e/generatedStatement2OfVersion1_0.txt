Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer `prime_cell` logic:**  The `prime_cell` function now directly returns an integer (0 for false, 1 for true) representing the prime status condition. This makes the code easier to follow.

2. **Boolean Array:**  The 2D array `a` is now of type `boolean`, storing true/false values directly, making the code more consistent and readable.

3. **Correct Indexing:** Array indices in Java start from 0, not 1.  The loops now iterate from 0 to `m-1` and `prime_cell` is called with `i+1` and `j+1` to use the correct row and column values from 1 to `m`.

4. **Simplified Boolean Assignment:** The assignment of the boolean values in the main loop is simplified to  `a[i][j] = (prime_cell(i + 1, j + 1) == 1);`. This makes the code easier to understand.


5. **Example Output handling:** The `main` function now includes a sample `m` value and prints the output in the requested format.  You can modify `m` to test different array sizes.  A newline is added at the end of printing for better output formatting.

6. **Conciseness and Efficiency:** The `prime_cell` function could be further optimized by checking for divisibility only up to the square root of the number, but the current version is clearer for understanding the core logic.



This revised version addresses the issues of the previous response and provides a clear, correct, and easy-to-understand solution.
