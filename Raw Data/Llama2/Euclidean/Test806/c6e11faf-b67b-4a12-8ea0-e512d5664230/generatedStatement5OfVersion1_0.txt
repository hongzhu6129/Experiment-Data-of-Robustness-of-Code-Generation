This JUnit test demonstrates how to capture and verify the program's output programmatically, which is much more robust and automated than manual inspection.  This is a better approach for more complex Java programs.



This provides a more comprehensive approach to testing, covering typical output verification and some considerations for edge cases related to output stream behavior and name variations.  For this simple example, basic output inspection is sufficient, but the more robust testing methods are valuable as your Java code becomes more complex.
