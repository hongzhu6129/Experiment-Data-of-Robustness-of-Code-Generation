Key Improvements and Explanations:

1. **Clearer Comments:** Added more descriptive comments explaining the logic and purpose of each section of the code.  Includes an example of how the method works.
2. **Handles Edge Cases:**  Added explicit checks for `null` or empty input arrays to make the code more robust.
3. **In-Place Modification:**  Emphasizes that the function modifies the input array `nums` directly and explains what that means for the user.
4. **Main Method with Examples:**  The `main` method demonstrates the usage of `removeDuplicates` with several different example arrays, including edge cases like an empty array and `null`. This provides clear and practical illustrations.
5. **Output Formatting:** Improved the output in the `main` method to clearly display the original array, the new length, and the unique elements after duplicate removal. This makes the results easy to understand.
6. **copyOfRange for Output:**  Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange()` in the main method to print only the relevant part (the unique elements) of the modified array, preventing any confusion caused by printing the entire array which might still contain duplicate values in later indices.
