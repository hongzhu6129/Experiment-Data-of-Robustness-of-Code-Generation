Key Improvements:

* **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and null arrays without throwing exceptions.
* **Clearer Pivot Selection:**  The pivot is explicitly calculated as the middle element using `left + (right - left) / 2`. This is safer than `(left + right) / 2` to avoid potential integer overflow for very large arrays.
* **Improved Comments:** Comments have been added to better explain the logic, especially the conditions in the `while` loops within `quickSort`.
* **Console Output:**  `Arrays.toString()` is used in the `main` method to print the sorted array in a user-friendly format, making it easier to verify the correctness.
* **Example Usage:** Added examples in `main` to demonstrate how to use the `sort` method with different types of input (including empty and null arrays).


This revised version is more robust, easier to understand, and provides a clearer demonstration of the Quick Sort algorithm.
