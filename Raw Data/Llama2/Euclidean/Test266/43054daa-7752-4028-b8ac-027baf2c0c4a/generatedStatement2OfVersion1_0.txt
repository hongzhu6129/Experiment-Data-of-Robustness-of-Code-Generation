Explanation:

1. **`main` Method:**
   - Takes input for the three sides of the triangle using a `Scanner`.
   - Calls `is_Valid` to check if the triangle is valid.
   - If valid, calls `area_triangle` to calculate and print the area.
   - If invalid, prints an error message.
   - Closes the `Scanner` to release resources.

2. **`is_Valid` Method:**
   - Takes three `double` values (sides of the triangle) as input.
   - Implements the triangle inequality theorem: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.
   - Returns `true` if the triangle is valid, `false` otherwise.

3. **`area_triangle` Method:**
   - Takes three `double` values (sides of the triangle) as input.
   - Calculates the semi-perimeter `s`.
   - Uses Heron's formula to calculate the area: `sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))`.
   - Returns the calculated area.


Key improvements in this version:

- **Input Validation:**  The `is_Valid` method ensures that the input forms a valid triangle before attempting to calculate the area.
- **Heron's Formula:**  Uses Heron's formula, which is suitable for calculating the area of a triangle given its three sides.
- **Clear Error Handling:** Provides a user-friendly error message if the input is invalid.
- **Resource Management:** Closes the `Scanner` to prevent resource leaks.
- **Comments:** Includes comments to explain the logic.


This improved version is more robust and provides a better user experience.
