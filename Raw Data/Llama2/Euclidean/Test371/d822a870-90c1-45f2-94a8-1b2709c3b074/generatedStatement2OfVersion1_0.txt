Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Method Demonstrations:**  Shows both `toArray()` methods: one with a pre-allocated array (more efficient) and one without (requires casting).  Highlights the recommended approach.
* **Illustrates PriorityQueue Order:** Shows how elements are removed from the `PriorityQueue` based on priority (natural ordering by default), emphasizing the difference between the array representation and the queue's behavior.
* **Custom Comparator Example:**  Includes an example of creating a `PriorityQueue` with a custom `Comparator` (reverse order in this case) to show how to handle different ordering requirements.
* **Concise and Focused:** Keeps the code focused on the core conversion process and relevant explanations.
* **Best Practice:**  Emphasizes the importance of pre-allocating the array when using `toArray()` for better performance.
