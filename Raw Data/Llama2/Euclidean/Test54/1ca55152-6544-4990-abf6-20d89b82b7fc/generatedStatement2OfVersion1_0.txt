Here's how it works:

1. **`main` Method:**
   - Takes the number to be checked (you can modify this to take input from the user if needed).
   - Calls the `checkPronic` method.
   - Prints the result ("Pronic Number" or "Not a Pronic Number").

2. **`checkPronic` Method:**
   - Takes an integer `num` as input.
   - Handles negative numbers (they can't be pronic).
   - Iterates from 0 up to the square root of `num`. This is an optimization because if `n * (n+1) == num`, then `n` must be less than or equal to the square root of `num`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `i * (i + 1)` is equal to `num`. If it is, the number is pronic, and the method returns `true`.
   - If the loop finishes without finding a match, the number is not pronic, and the method returns `false`.
