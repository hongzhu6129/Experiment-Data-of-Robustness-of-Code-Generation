**Explanation:**

1. **Input and Sum Calculation:** The program takes an integer input (e.g., 12345), calculates the sum of its digits (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15), and prints the sum.

2. **Digit-by-Digit Printing:** It then iterates through the digits of the sum (15). In each iteration:
   - `print_number()` is called to convert the current digit (e.g., 5, then 1) into its English word equivalent ("five", "one").
   - A space is added after each word (unless it's the last digit).

3. **`print_number()` function:**  This function takes an integer digit as input and uses a `String` array (`englishDigits`) to map the digit to its English word representation.  It then prints the word.  There's also a basic check to handle any invalid input (digits outside the 0-9 range), although this is unlikely to occur in the context of this program.


Key improvements in this revised version:

- **Handles negative numbers:** The code uses `Math.abs()` to correctly handle negative inputs.
- **Clearer output formatting:** Spaces between English words and a newline at the end make the output more readable.
- **Handles unexpected digits:** The `print_number()` function now has a check to print "Invalid digit" if an unexpected input is encountered (though the code's logic minimizes this possibility).
