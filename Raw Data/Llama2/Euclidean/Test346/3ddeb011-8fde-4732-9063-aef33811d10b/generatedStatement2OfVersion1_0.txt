**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **Variables:**  We use `int` to declare integer variables `num1`, `num2`, and `sum`.  Variables store values.  We initialize `num1` and `num2` with the numbers we want to add.
2. **Arithmetic Operator:**  The `+` operator performs addition.
3. **Printing Output:** `System.out.println()` displays the result on the console. The `+` operator is also used for string concatenation (joining strings together).
4. **Comments:**  Lines starting with `//` are comments.  They explain the code but are ignored by the compiler. Good comments are crucial for readable code.
5. **Command-line arguments (more advanced):**  The `args` array in `main(String[] args)` holds any command-line arguments the user provides when running the program.  The example code shows how you can use this to get numbers from the user, but also includes error handling (`try-catch`) in case the user enters non-numeric data, demonstrating more robust coding.


**To compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SumOfTwoNumbers.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run: `javac SumOfTwoNumbers.java`
3. **Run:**  `java SumOfTwoNumbers` (or to provide command-line input: `java SumOfTwoNumbers 5 7`)


This revised response provides a clear and concise solution to the original problem while also incorporating more educational elements within the context of the `main` method.
