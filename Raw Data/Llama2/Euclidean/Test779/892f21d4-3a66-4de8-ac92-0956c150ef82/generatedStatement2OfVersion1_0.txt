Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is now structured to be easier to follow, with better variable names and comments.
2. **Efficiency Optimizations:**
   - The `break` statements inside the loops prevent unnecessary calculations when `a3` or `sum` exceeds `n`.  This significantly speeds up the process.
3. **Correctness:** The code now correctly handles the condition "two (or more) different ways" by using nested loop logic and correctly identifies only the sums which can be represented as sums of cubes.
4. **Output Formatting:** The output clearly displays the Ramanujan numbers and their representations as sums of cubes.
5. **Flexibility:** The `n` variable at the beginning lets you easily change the search limit.


How to run:

1. Save the code as `RamanujanNumbers.java`.
2. Compile: `javac RamanujanNumbers.java`
3. Run: `java RamanujanNumbers`


This improved version will efficiently find and print Ramanujan numbers (as defined in the problem description) up to the specified limit.
