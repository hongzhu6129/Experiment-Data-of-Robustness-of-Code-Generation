Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Readability:** Variable names are more descriptive (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` instead of `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`).
2. **Correctness:** The inner loops now start from `c+1` and `a+1` respectively to avoid duplicate pairs and correctly find numbers expressible as sums of two cubes in *two or more different ways*.
3. **Efficiency:**
   - **`break` statements:** Added `break` statements inside loops to avoid unnecessary calculations when the sum exceeds `n` or after a solution is found while checking for multiple representations.
   - **Start `b` from `a + 1`:** Ensures we don't check the same pair twice (e.g., (1, 2) and (2, 1)).
   - **`count` variable:**  Clears up the logic by counting how many ways a sum can be expressed.




This revised code is more accurate, efficient, and easier to understand, making it a better solution to the Ramanujan number problem.
