3. **Comprehensive Testing in main():** The `main` method now includes tests for both a present and a non-present element, demonstrating how to handle the `-1` return value (element not found).
4. **Comments and Explanations:** Added comments to explain the logic within the `ternary_search` method.
5. **Return -1 for Element Not Found:** The method now explicitly returns `-1` if the target element is not found in the array. This makes it easier for the calling code to handle this case.


This revised code is more robust, readable, and demonstrates proper handling of the case where the element is not found.  It also uses best practices for calculating the midpoints in the ternary search to avoid potential integer overflow.
