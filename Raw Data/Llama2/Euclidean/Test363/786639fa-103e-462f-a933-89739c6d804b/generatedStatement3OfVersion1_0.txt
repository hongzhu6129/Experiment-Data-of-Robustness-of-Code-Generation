4. **Very Large Radius:**
   - Input: radius = 1000000 (or any large number)
   - Expected Output: Calculate and verify the extremely large perimeter and area to check for potential overflow issues (though `double` can handle very large numbers).

5. **Small Radius:**
   - Input: radius = 0.0001 (or any small number)
   - Expected Output: Verify calculations for very small values to ensure precision.

6. **Boundary Case (close to the maximum double value):**
   - Input: radius = Double.MAX_VALUE (or a value close to it).
   - Expected Output:  Test how the program behaves with extremely large values.  It's important to check for potential `Infinity` or `NaN` results, which can occur with floating-point arithmetic.
