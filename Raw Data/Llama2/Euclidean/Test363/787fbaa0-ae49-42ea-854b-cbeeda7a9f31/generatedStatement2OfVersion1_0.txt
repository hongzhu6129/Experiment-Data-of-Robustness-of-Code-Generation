Key improvements and explanations:

* **Test Cases:**  The `CircleCalculatorTest` class uses JUnit 5 to provide a range of test cases, including:
    * **Zero Radius:** Checks the boundary case where the radius is 0.
    * **Given Example:**  Tests the provided example values (radius 7.5).
    * **Radius of 1:** A simple case for basic verification.
    * **Larger Radius:** Tests with a radius of 5.
    * **Negative Radius:**  Added tests to handle invalid input (negative radius), expecting an `IllegalArgumentException`.  While the current `calculateArea` and `calculatePerimeter` don't explicitly throw exceptions, these tests demonstrate how to handle them *if* such validation was added to those methods.  It's good practice to handle invalid inputs defensively.
    * **Very Large Radius:** Tests with extremely large numbers to check for potential overflow or precision issues.

* **JUnit 5:**  Uses the modern JUnit 5 testing framework, which is more powerful and flexible.
* **Assertions:**  Uses `assertEquals` for precise value comparisons (with a delta for floating-point comparisons if necessary) and `assertThrows` to verify exception handling.
* **Clearer Output:**  The `main` method now prints the results more clearly.



How to run the tests (assuming you have JUnit 5 set up in your project):

1. **IDE:** Most IDEs (IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans) have built-in support for running JUnit tests.  Right-click on the test class or method and select "Run".

2. **Command Line (with Maven):** `mvn test`


If you want to add the exception handling for negative radius input as the test cases suggest, modify the `calculateArea` and `calculatePerimeter` methods:
