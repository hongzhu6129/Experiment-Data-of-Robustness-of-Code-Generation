Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is better structured and includes helpful comments explaining the purpose of each method and section.
* **Efficiency (isPalindrome):**  The `isPalindrome` method is more efficient. Converting to a string, reversing, and comparing is generally faster for this purpose, especially for larger numbers.
* **Input Handling:** The `main` method uses a `Scanner` to get user input, making it more interactive and user-friendly.  Also closes the `Scanner` afterwards.
* **Error Handling (Optional):**  You might consider adding input validation to `main` (e.g., checking for negative numbers or non-integer input) to make it more robust.
