**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clear Method Signatures:** The code adheres to the specified method signatures `main` and `Saddleback`.

2. **Saddleback Search Algorithm:** The `Saddleback` method efficiently searches the matrix. It starts from the top-right corner.  If the current element is smaller than the target, it moves down (to a larger element). If the current element is larger than the target, it moves left (to a smaller element). This leverages the sorted nature of the rows and columns.

3. **Return int[]:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` containing the row and column index of the target.  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`. This makes it clear whether the search was successful.

4. **Example Usage in main:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` method with a sample matrix and target value. It handles the case where the target is not found and prints an appropriate message.

5. **Conciseness and Clarity:** The code is more concise and readable, focusing on the core logic of the Saddleback search.

6. **Correctness:** The algorithm is correct for matrices where each row and column is sorted in ascending order.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. Save the code as `SaddlebackSearch.java`.
2. Compile: `javac SaddlebackSearch.java`
3. Run: `java SaddlebackSearch`


This improved version addresses the previous issues and provides a robust and efficient implementation of the Saddleback search algorithm.
