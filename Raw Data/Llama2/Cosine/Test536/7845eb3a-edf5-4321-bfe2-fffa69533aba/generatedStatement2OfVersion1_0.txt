Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly adheres to the requested method signatures: `public static void main(String[])` and `private static int[] Saddleback(int[][], int, int, int)`.

2. **Return an `int[]`:** The `Saddleback` function returns an `int[]` of size 2 to store the row and column index.  If the element is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.  This makes it easy for the `main` method to check if the element was found.

3. **Saddleback Search Implementation:** The core saddleback search algorithm is implemented correctly. It starts from the top-right corner and efficiently eliminates either a row or a column in each step.

4. **Boundary Checks:** The `while` loop condition `row < m && col >= 0` ensures that we stay within the bounds of the 2D array.

5. **Example Usage and Testing in `main`:**  The `main` method now provides a clear example of how to use the `Saddleback` method, including handling cases where the target is not present in the array.


This revised version addresses the prompt's requirements more effectively, provides better structure, and includes more robust error handling.
