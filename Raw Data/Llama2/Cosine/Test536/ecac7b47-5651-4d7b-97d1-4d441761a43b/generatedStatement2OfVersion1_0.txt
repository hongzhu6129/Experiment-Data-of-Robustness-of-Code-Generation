Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly adheres to the requested `main` and `Saddleback` method signatures.
* **Return an Array:**  The `Saddleback` function returns an `int[]` to store the row and column index.  This is better practice than relying on global variables.  If the element isn't found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.
* **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to call `Saddleback` and interpret the results. It also includes an example where the target element is *not* present.
* **Comments and Readability:**  The code includes comments to explain the logic and the purpose of different sections, enhancing readability.
* **Error Handling (Not Found):** The code explicitly handles the case where the target element is not found in the array, returning `{-1, -1}` and printing a "not found" message.





This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and follows best practices for function design and error handling.
