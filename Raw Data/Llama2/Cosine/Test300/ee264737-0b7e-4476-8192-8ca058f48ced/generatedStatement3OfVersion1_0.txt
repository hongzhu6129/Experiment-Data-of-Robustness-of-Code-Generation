**Key improvements and explanations:**

* **Handles Null and Empty Inputs:** The `multiplyBinary` method now explicitly handles `null` and empty string inputs, returning "0" in those cases.  You could modify this to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if you prefer to treat these as errors.

* **Clearer Conversion Methods:** The `binaryToDecimal` and `decimalToBinary` methods are more concise and readable.

* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The test cases now cover normal multiplication, multiplication by zero, and the crucial corner cases of `null` and empty string inputs. It also tests with larger numbers, which previously could cause issues.

* **JUnit 5:**  The test cases are using JUnit 5, a standard and powerful testing framework for Java. You'll need to add the JUnit 5 dependency to your project to run these tests.



This improved version provides better error handling, clarity, and more robust testing to ensure the `multiplyBinary` function works correctly in various scenarios.  Using a good testing framework like JUnit is highly recommended for any serious Java development.
