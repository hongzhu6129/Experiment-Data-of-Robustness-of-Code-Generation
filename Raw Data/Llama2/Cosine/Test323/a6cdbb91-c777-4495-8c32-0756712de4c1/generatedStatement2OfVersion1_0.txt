**Test Cases:**

| Input (n) | Expected Output | Notes                                      |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 12345      | 15              | Positive multi-digit number              |
| 0          | 0               | Zero                                       |
| 9          | 9               | Single-digit number                       |
| -123       | 6               | Negative number (absolute value is used) |
| 1000       | 1               | Number with zeros                         |
| 9999       | 36              | Large number                             |
| Integer.MAX_VALUE | 1                | Maximum positive integer. Demonstrates handling overflow (2147483647 sums to 29 but if the sum variable is an int, it might wrap around). Ideally, change `sum` to `long` if you need to handle this edge case. |
| Integer.MIN_VALUE | 1                | Minimum negative integer (absolute value: 2147483648) demonstrates possible overflow - see above.|



**Explanation of Corner Cases:**

* **Zero:**  Handles the case where the input is 0.
* **Single Digit:**  Correctly calculates the sum when the input is a single digit.
* **Negative Number:** The code now uses `Math.abs()` to handle negative numbers appropriately.
* **Large Numbers:** Tests the ability to handle numbers with multiple digits and potentially large sums.
* **Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE:**  These cases are important because they check for potential overflow. If your program doesn't handle very large numbers correctly, the sum might become inaccurate due to integer overflow. Using `long` for the `sum` variable is recommended if you expect inputs in this range.




**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You can manually enter these test cases into the console when prompted by the program. For a more automated approach, consider using a testing framework like JUnit, where you can write unit tests to verify the correctness of your `functionOne` method for each test case.  This is good practice in software development. Example JUnit test:
