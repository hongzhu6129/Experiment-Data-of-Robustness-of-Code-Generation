**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Efficiency:**  The original linked code has nested loops that go up to `N`. While it works, it's inefficient for larger `N`. This version iterates up to the cube root of `n`, improving performance significantly.
2. **Avoiding Duplicates:** The code uses `b = a + 1` and `d = c + 1` in the inner loops to avoid finding the same pairs of cubes in a different order (e.g., 1^3 + 12^3 and 12^3 + 1^3).
3. **Clarity:** The code is more readable with better variable names and comments.
4. **Early Exit:** The `return;` statement exits the program after the first Ramanujan number is found, as requested by the prompt ("find *any* number"). If you want to find all such numbers within the given range, remove the `return` statement.
5. **Flexibility:**  You can easily change the value of `n` to search within a different range.

**How it Works:**

The code iterates through possible pairs of cubes (a^3 + b^3) and (c^3 + d^3) and checks if their sums are equal while ensuring that the pairs themselves are different (a != c and a != d). When such a number is found, it prints the result and exits.  The starting point of the inner loops (b = a + 1 and d = c + 1) is crucial for avoiding duplicate pairs and improving efficiency.
