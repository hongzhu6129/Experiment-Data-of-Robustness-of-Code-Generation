Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` input arrays. This robustness prevents `NullPointerExceptions` and ensures proper functionality in all scenarios.

2. **Clearer variable naming:**  `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than a simple `j`, making the code easier to understand.

3. **Concise return:** `uniqueIndex + 1` directly calculates the new length.

4. **Comprehensive `main` method:**  Includes multiple test cases (including edge cases) to demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs, and prints the updated array (up to the new length) along with the length for better verification. Using `Arrays.copyOfRange` ensures that only the relevant portion of the array (without the duplicates) is printed.



This improved version adheres strictly to the given method signatures, effectively removes duplicates from a sorted array in-place, handles edge cases, and is well-documented.
