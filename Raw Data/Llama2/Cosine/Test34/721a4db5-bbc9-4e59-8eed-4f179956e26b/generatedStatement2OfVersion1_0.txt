Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  Improved variable names (like `nowInKolkata`) and comments make the code easier to understand.
* **Flexibility:** The `formatOffset` method handles both positive and negative offsets correctly using the absolute value for both minutes and in the formatting of the hours. It now also correctly pads with leading zeros to ensure a consistent format like "+05:30" or "-08:00".
* **Demonstrates Different Scenarios:** The code now shows how to get the offset from a `ZonedDateTime`, a fixed `ZoneOffset`, and even from parsing a date string containing an offset, providing a more complete example.
* **Correctness:**  The main issue, the incorrect sign handling, is fixed in  `formatOffset`.



This revised code is much more robust, readable, and effectively demonstrates how to extract and format zone offsets in Java.
