**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DateTimeBefore.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac DateTimeBefore.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled program: `java DateTimeBefore` (This will use the default 2 hours and 30 minutes)
4. **Run with arguments:** `java DateTimeBefore 5 15` (This will subtract 5 hours and 15 minutes)



**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Uses `java.time`:**  The modern `java.time` API (Java 8 and later) is used, which is much preferred over older date/time classes.
* **Clearer Output:** The date and time are formatted for better readability using `DateTimeFormatter`.
* **Handles User Input (Basic):**  The code now includes a basic way to take hours and minutes as command-line arguments, demonstrating how to incorporate user input within the limitations of the `main` method.  More robust input handling would usually involve using a `Scanner` if you were outside of `main`.
* **Error Handling (Basic):** Added a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user provides non-integer input.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the code.


**For More Advanced Input:**

If you needed more sophisticated user input (handling invalid formats, prompts, etc.), you would typically create separate methods and use a `Scanner` object. The `main` method would then call these methods. However, the question specifically asked to only use the `main` method signature.
