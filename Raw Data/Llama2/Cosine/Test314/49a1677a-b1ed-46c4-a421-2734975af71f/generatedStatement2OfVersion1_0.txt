Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Clearer Helper Function:** The `containsDigit7` function makes the logic more readable and maintainable.
* **Comprehensive Comments:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each part.
* **Test Cases in `main`:**  Several test cases demonstrate how the function works with different inputs.  This helps in verifying correctness.
* **Edge Case Handling:**  The code includes a test case for `n=0` to show how such a boundary condition is managed.



This improved version adheres strictly to the requested method signatures while also providing a more robust and understandable solution.
