Key improvements in this revised answer:

* **Clarity and Explanation:** Added comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code and the output.
* **Efficiency:**  Clearly recommended `Arrays.equals()` as the preferred and more efficient method for array comparison.
* **Manual Comparison (for learning):**  Included a `compareArraysManually()` method to demonstrate the logic behind array comparison if someone wants to understand how it works internally.  It's emphasized that `Arrays.equals()` is generally better for real-world use.
* **Multiple Test Cases:**  Added more test cases with different arrays to demonstrate the different scenarios (equal arrays, unequal arrays, arrays of different lengths).
