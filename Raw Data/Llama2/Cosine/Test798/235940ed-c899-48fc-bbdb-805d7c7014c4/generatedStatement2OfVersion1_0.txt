Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Node Class:** The `Node` class is defined to represent the nodes of the binary tree.

2. **Recursive `maxDepth()`:**  The `maxDepth()` function recursively calculates the depth of the tree.  The base case is when `node` is `null` (empty subtree), returning 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls `maxDepth()` on the left and right subtrees, takes the maximum of the two depths, and adds 1 (for the current node).

3. **Illustrative `main()` Method:**  The `main()` method provides examples of how to create a binary tree and use the `maxDepth()` function to calculate its height. The second example in `main()` demonstrates checking if the tree's depth exceeds a specific value (5 in this case).

4. **Handling exceeding depth in `main()`:** The main method demonstrates how you can compare the calculated `maxDepth()` with a target depth and print appropriate messages if the maximum depth exceeds a specified value.


This improved code addresses the prompt's requirements accurately and provides a robust and understandable solution for calculating the depth of a binary tree and checking if it exceeds a given depth.
