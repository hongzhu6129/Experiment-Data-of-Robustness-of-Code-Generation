**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Nanosecond Precision:** Using `System.nanoTime()` provides higher precision than `System.currentTimeMillis()`. While the final result is displayed in microseconds, using nanoseconds for measurement ensures greater accuracy, especially for very short execution times.

2. **Clearer Output:** The code now clearly labels the output as "microseconds" to avoid ambiguity.  It also includes an example calculation (sum of numbers) so you can see it in action.

3. **Millisecond alternative shown:** The less precise but sometimes useful millisecond-based timing is included for comparison.

4. **Correct Conversion:**  The nanosecond to microsecond conversion is accurately done by dividing by 1000.


**How to Use:**

1. Replace the example code (calculating the sum) with the code you want to measure.
2. Compile and run the Java program.  The output will show the execution time of your code in microseconds.


**Important Notes:**

* The measured time might vary slightly on each run due to factors like system load, garbage collection, etc.  It's often a good idea to run the code multiple times and take an average.
* For extremely short code segments, the overhead of calling `System.nanoTime()` might be noticeable. In such cases, consider running the code segment multiple times in a loop and dividing the total time by the number of iterations to get a more accurate measurement per iteration.
