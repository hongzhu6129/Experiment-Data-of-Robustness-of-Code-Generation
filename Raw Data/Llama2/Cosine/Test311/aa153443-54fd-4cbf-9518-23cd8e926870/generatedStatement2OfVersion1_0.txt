**Explanation and Corrections:**

The original prompt had a couple of errors:

1. **Incorrect Formula:** The provided formula had a `+ (1/9)` which should have been `- (1/7)`.  The Leibniz formula for pi alternates signs strictly.
2. **Inconsistent Terms:** The prompt mentioned using terms up to 1/11 in both approximations, then added 1/13 to the second.  While it's fine to have different approximations, the description should be clear.

The code above corrects these issues:

* It uses the correct alternating signs (`-`, `+`, `-`, `+`, ...) in the Leibniz formula.
* It calculates the first approximation up to 1/11 and the second up to 1/13, demonstrating how adding more terms improves the approximation.
* It uses `1.0` and `3.0`, etc., to ensure floating-point division, giving a more accurate result.


This revised code now accurately computes two successive approximations of pi using the Leibniz formula.
