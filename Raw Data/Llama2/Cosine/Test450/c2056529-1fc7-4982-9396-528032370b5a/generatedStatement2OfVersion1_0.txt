Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** `k` is now more clearly explained as representing the new length of the array.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code explicitly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` input arrays, preventing potential `NullPointerExceptions`.

3. **Improved Comments:** Comments are added to explain the logic and the purpose of the code.

4. **Demonstrative `main` method:**  The `main` method now demonstrates the usage of `removeDuplicates` with different test cases, including edge cases, and prints the results clearly using `Arrays.toString()` and `Arrays.copyOfRange()` to show only the relevant part of the array.


This revised version is more robust, easier to understand, and provides better demonstrations of how to use the `removeDuplicates` method.
