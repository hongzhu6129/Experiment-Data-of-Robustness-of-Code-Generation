This improved version:

1. **Demonstrates multiple comparisons:**  Shows how `compareToIgnoreCase` works with different string pairs.
2. **Clearer output:**  Explains the results of the comparisons more explicitly.
3. **Handles command-line arguments:** Allows the user to provide strings to compare as arguments when running the program from the command line.  It also includes error handling for incorrect argument counts.


To compile and run from the command line:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StringCompareIgnoreCase.java`.
2. **Compile:** `javac StringCompareIgnoreCase.java`
3. **Run:** `java StringCompareIgnoreCase string1 string2` (Replace `string1` and `string2` with the strings you want to compare).  If you don't provide any arguments, it will use the default examples in the `main` method.
