**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - x1: 25
   - y1: 35
   - x2: 35.5
   - y2: 25.5
   - Expected Output: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - x1: 40
   - y1: -74
   - x2: 40
   - y2: -74
   - Expected Output: 0 km

3. **Opposite Sides of the Earth (Antipodes):**
   - x1: 45
   - y1: 0
   - x2: -45
   - y2: 180
   - Expected Output: ~20015.12 km  (approximately Earth's diameter)


4. **North and South Poles:**
   - x1: 90  (North Pole)
   - y1: 0   (Longitude irrelevant at poles)
   - x2: -90 (South Pole)
   - y2: 100 (Longitude irrelevant at poles)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.12 km

5. **Points on the Equator:**
   - x1: 0
   - y1: 0
   - x2: 0
   - y2: 90
   - Expected Output: ~10007.56 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 4)


6. **Points near the International Date Line:**
   - x1: 10
   - y1: 179 
   - x2: 10
   - y2: -179
   - Expected Output:  A small distance (because they are close despite the large longitude difference)

7. **Invalid Input (optional - depends on how you handle errors):**
   - x1: "abc" (Non-numeric input)  - Expect an error or exception


**How to run these tests:**

You can either:

* **Manually:**  Input these values into your program and verify the output.
* **Automated Testing (Recommended):** Use a testing framework like JUnit. Create test methods, provide input values, and assert that the calculated distance matches the expected value. This is a much more robust and efficient approach for thorough testing.  Here is an example of JUnit test code.  (You would need to add the JUnit library to your project.)
