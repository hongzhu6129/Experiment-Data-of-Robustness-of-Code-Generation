Key improvements and explanations:

* **Exception Handling:**  The code now throws `IllegalArgumentException` if either input string is `null` or if the strings have the same length. This makes the function more robust.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `shortStr` and `longStr` improves readability.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases (using JUnit 5):**
    * `testDifferentLengths`:  Tests with strings of different lengths.
    * `testNullInput`: Tests with `null` inputs.
    * `testSameLength`: Tests with strings of the same length.
    * `testEmptyStrings`: Tests cases where one or both strings are empty (important corner cases!).
    * `testWithSpecialCharacters`: Checks if it handles spaces and symbols correctly.
* **Main Method Examples:**  Demonstrates how to use the function and how to handle the potential `IllegalArgumentException`.


How to Run the Tests (using JUnit 5):

1. **IDE:** If you are using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, it will have built-in support for running JUnit tests.  Just right-click on the test class or a specific test method and select "Run".

2. **Command Line (with Maven):** If you are using Maven, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the command:  `mvn test`

3. **Command Line (with Gradle):**  If you're using Gradle, the command is: `./gradlew test`


The test results will show you whether all the test cases passed or if any failed, helping you ensure the correctness of your `combineStrings` function.
