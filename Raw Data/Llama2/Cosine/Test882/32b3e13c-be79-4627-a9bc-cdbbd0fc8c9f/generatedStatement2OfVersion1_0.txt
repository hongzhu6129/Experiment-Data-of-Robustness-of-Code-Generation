**Explanation:**

1. **Node Class:** Represents a node in the binary tree. It has `data`, `left` child, and `right` child.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):**
   - This recursive method calculates the maximum depth.
   - **Base Case:** If the `node` is `null` (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  It recursively calculates the depth of the left subtree (`leftDepth`) and the right subtree (`rightDepth`).
   - **Return:** It returns the maximum of `leftDepth` and `rightDepth`, plus 1 (to account for the current node).

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - Creates a `BinaryTreeMaxDepth` object.
   - Constructs sample binary trees (including an empty tree and a single-node tree for testing).
   - Calls `maxDepth()` to calculate and print the maximum depth of each tree.


**How it works (example):**

Let's trace the first example tree:
