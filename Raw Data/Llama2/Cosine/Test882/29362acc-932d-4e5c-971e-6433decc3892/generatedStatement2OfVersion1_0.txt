Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Node Class:**  A `Node` class is defined to represent the nodes of the binary tree.  Each node stores its data and references to its left and right children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):**  This recursive method calculates the maximum depth of the tree.
   - **Base Case:** If the current `node` is `null` (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:** It recursively calculates the depth of the left subtree (`lDepth`) and the right subtree (`rDepth`). The maximum depth of the current node is then 1 (for the current node itself) plus the larger of `lDepth` and `rDepth`.

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - Creates an instance of the `BinaryTreeDepth` class.
   - Creates sample binary trees (including an example of an unbalanced tree where one branch is significantly longer).
   - Calls the `maxDepth()` method to find the height/depth of the trees and prints the results.


Key improvements over a simpler approach:

- **Handles `null` nodes:**  The base case correctly handles empty subtrees, preventing `NullPointerExceptions`.
- **Clear Recursive Logic:**  The recursive calls and depth calculation are straightforward and easy to understand.
- **Example of Unbalanced Tree:** The `main` method includes an example of an unbalanced tree to demonstrate that the code correctly handles trees where one branch is much longer than the other.
