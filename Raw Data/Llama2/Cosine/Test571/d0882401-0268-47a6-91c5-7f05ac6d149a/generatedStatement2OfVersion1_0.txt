Key improvements and explanations:

* **Handles different date and time formats:** The code now correctly parses dates, times, and combined date-time strings using appropriate format patterns.
* **Locale support:** Added `Locale` support to handle dates in different languages and formats. The `Locale.getDefault()` is used when no locale is explicitly provided.
* **Handles invalid input:** Includes error handling for `null` or empty input strings, and catches `DateTimeParseException` to prevent crashes due to invalid date formats.
* **Clearer output:**  The output now indicates whether the converted value is a `LocalDate`, `LocalDateTime`, or just the date/time part of a `LocalDateTime`.
* **Helper method:** The overloaded `convertToDate` method makes the code more flexible.
* **More comprehensive examples:** Includes examples demonstrating different date/time formats, locales, and error handling.


This improved version is more robust, handles a wider range of inputs, and provides clearer error messages, making it more practical for real-world applications.
