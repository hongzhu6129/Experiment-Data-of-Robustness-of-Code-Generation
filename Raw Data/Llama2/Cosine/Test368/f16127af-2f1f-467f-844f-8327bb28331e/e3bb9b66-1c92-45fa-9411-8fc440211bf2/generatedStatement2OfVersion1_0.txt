## Test Cases

Here are some test cases, including corner cases:

**1. Normal Cases:**

* **Input:** num1=1, den1=2, num2=1, den2=3
* **Expected Output:**
    * Addition: 5/6
    * Subtraction: 1/6
    * Multiplication: 1/6
    * Division: 3/2
    * Remainder: 3/6


* **Input:** num1=3, den1=4, num2=1, den2=2
* **Expected Output:**
    * Addition: 10/8
    * Subtraction: 2/8
    * Multiplication: 3/8
    * Division: 6/4
    * Remainder: -2/8


**2. Corner Cases:**

* **Zero Denominator:**  num1=1, den1=0, num2=1, den2=2  (and variations where den2 is 0)
* **Expected Output:**  "Denominator cannot be zero. Exiting."

* **Division by Zero:** num1=1, den1=2, num2=0, den2=3
* **Expected Output:** "Division by zero error." (other operations should still calculate correctly)

* **Large Numbers:** num1=10000, den1=20000, num2=5000, den2=10000 (to test for potential integer overflow �  consider using `long` data type if needed)

* **Negative Numbers:** num1=-5, den1=2, num2=3, den2=-4 (test handling of negative numerators and denominators)

* **Zero Numerators:** num1=0, den1=5, num2=3, den2=4 (and variations with num2=0)

**3. Simplification (if implemented):**

If you implement the `gcd` and fraction simplification, add tests to check if fractions are correctly reduced to their simplest form. For instance, 10/8 should simplify to 5/4.




By running these test cases, you can thoroughly verify that your fraction calculator works correctly under different conditions.  Remember to consider using a testing framework like JUnit for more structured and automated testing as your program grows.
