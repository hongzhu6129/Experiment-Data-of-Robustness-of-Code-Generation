**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Command-Line Arguments:** The code now uses `String.join(" ", args)` to correctly combine all command-line arguments into a single sentence string.  This is crucial for handling sentences with spaces.
2. **Input Validation:** It checks for empty input sentences and sentences with only one word (where there would be no penultimate word). This makes the code more robust.
3. **Trim Whitespace:** The `trim()` method removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the input sentence, which prevents errors caused by extra spaces.
4. **Clearer Logic:** The code uses `lastIndexOf()` to find the spaces, making the logic for finding the second-to-last word cleaner.
5. **Handles Two-Word Sentences:** It correctly handles the case where the sentence contains only two words.
6. **No External Libraries:** The code adheres to the requirement of not using any functions other than `main`.


**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `PenultimateWord.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac PenultimateWord.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with a sentence as input: `java PenultimateWord This is a test sentence`


The output will be: `test`.
