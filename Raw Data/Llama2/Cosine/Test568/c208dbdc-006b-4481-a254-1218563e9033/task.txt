Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program to sort an array of positive integers using the Bead Sort Algorithm. According to Wikipedia "Bead sort, also called gravity sort, is a natural sorting algorithm, developed by Joshua J. Arulanandham, Cristian S. Calude and Michael J. Dinneen in 2002, and published in The Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science. Both digital and analog hardware implementations of bead sort can achieve a sorting time of O(n); however, the implementation of this algorithm tends to be significantly slower in software and can only be used to sort lists of positive integers. Also, it seems that even in the best case, the algorithm requires O(n2) space".\n\n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n Problem Id is : c208dbdc-006b-4481-a254-1218563e9033.\n
