**Explanation and Test Cases:**

1. **`ListAvailableCharsets.java` (Main Code):**
   - Uses `Charset.availableCharsets()` to get a `SortedMap` of available charsets.
   - Iterates through the map and prints the canonical name (`charsetName`) and the display name (`charset.displayName()`) of each charset.
   - You can uncomment the line `System.out.println("   Aliases: " + charset.aliases());` if you also want to print the aliases for each character set.

2. **Test Cases (`ListAvailableCharsetsTest.java`):**
   - **`testListCharsetsContainsUTF8()`:**  This test verifies that "UTF-8" (a very common charset) is present in the output of `listCharsets()`. It redirects `System.out` to capture the output and then checks if "UTF-8" is in the captured string.  It's important to restore `System.out` after each test.
   - **`testListCharsetsNonEmpty()`:** This test is crucial.  It ensures that `Charset.availableCharsets()` never returns an empty map.  There should *always* be at least one character set available on any Java platform.
   - **`testListCharsetsHandlesAliases()` (Corner Case):**  This test checks that the code handles charsets that have aliases correctly. UTF-16 (and some others) have aliases (like UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE). The test first checks if "UTF-16" exists and then (if you uncomment the alias printing in the main code), checks if an alias is also displayed in the output.   The `if (Charset.isSupported("UTF-16"))` guard handles the very unlikely case where a platform doesn't support UTF-16.



**How to Run the Tests (with JUnit 5):**

1. **IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.):**  Most IDEs have built-in support for running JUnit tests. Just right-click on the test class or test method and select "Run".
2. **Command Line (with Maven):**  If you're using Maven, you can run the tests with: `mvn test`
3. **Command Line (without build tools):** You'll need to compile and run the tests using the `javac` and `java` commands, ensuring that the JUnit JAR is on the classpath. This is a bit more involved. If you need help with this method, please let me know.
