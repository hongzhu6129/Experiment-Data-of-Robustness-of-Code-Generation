Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:** The code now explicitly checks for `null` arrays and empty arrays. This prevents `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
* **Clearer output:** The `println` statements are more descriptive, making it easier to understand the results.
* **Helper method:** The logic for comparing arrays is extracted into a separate `compareFirstLast` method, making the `main` method cleaner and more focused.  This improves code organization and readability.
* **Comprehensive testing:** The `main` method now includes examples with empty and `null` arrays to demonstrate how the edge cases are handled.
