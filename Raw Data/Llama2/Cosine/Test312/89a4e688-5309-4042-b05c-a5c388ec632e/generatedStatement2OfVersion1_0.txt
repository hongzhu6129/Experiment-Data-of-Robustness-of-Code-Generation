Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles edge cases:**  The `bucketSort` method now correctly handles empty or single-element arrays.
2. **Dynamic Bucket Index Calculation:** The `hash` function now correctly distributes elements across buckets, even when `min` and `max` are equal.  It uses a double cast to ensure proper distribution across the buckets.
3. **Clearer Bucket Handling:** Uses a `List<Integer>[]` for buckets, making the code easier to understand.
4. **Uses `Collections.sort()`:** Sorts individual buckets efficiently using the built-in `Collections.sort()` method.  This avoids unnecessary reimplementation of sorting logic and improves performance, especially for larger datasets within each bucket.
5. **Comments and Readability:** Added comments to explain key parts of the code, making it more maintainable.


This improved version addresses potential issues with the previous implementation and provides a more robust and efficient bucket sort.
