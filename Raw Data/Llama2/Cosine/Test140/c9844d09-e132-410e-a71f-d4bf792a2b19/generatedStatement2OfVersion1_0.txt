**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Input Validation:** The provided solution now includes input validation. It swaps `year1` and `year2` if `year1` is greater than `year2` to ensure that `year1` is always the earlier year.

2. **Clarity and Readability:** The code is formatted for better readability, with comments explaining the logic. Variable names are more descriptive.

3. **Error Handling (Optional):**  While not strictly required by the prompt, for a more robust program, consider adding error handling to check for invalid year inputs (e.g., negative years or extremely large years).

4. **`Scanner` resource management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` after it's no longer needed to prevent resource leaks.



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DaysBetweenYears.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:
