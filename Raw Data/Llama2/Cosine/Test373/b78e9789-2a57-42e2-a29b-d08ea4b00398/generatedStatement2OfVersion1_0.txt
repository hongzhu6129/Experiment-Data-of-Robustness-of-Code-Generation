**Test Cases:**

1. **Normal Case:**  Run the program under normal circumstances.  Verify that the output is a date and time string in the specified format (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS) and that the date and time are reasonably close to the actual current time.

2. **Time Zone Change:**  Change your system's time zone. Run the program again. The output should reflect the current time in the *new* time zone.  This tests that the program is correctly using the system's time zone settings.

3. **Daylight Saving Time Transition:**  If possible, run the program shortly before and shortly after a Daylight Saving Time transition (either springing forward or falling back). Verify that the time changes correctly.  This is important to ensure the program handles time zone transitions gracefully. (This test is time-dependent and might not be easily automated).

4. **Locale Change (Optional but recommended):**  Change your system's locale. While the date and time *format* shouldn't change (because we've explicitly specified it), changing the locale can reveal underlying issues related to time and date handling.  For a more thorough test, you could remove the explicit `DateTimeFormatter` and let the program use the default formatting for the locale, then verify that it's correct.
