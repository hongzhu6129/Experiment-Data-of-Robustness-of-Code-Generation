**Explanation:**

1. **`StringLengthComparator` Class:**
   - This class implements the `Comparator<String>` interface.
   - The `compare(String s1, String s2)` method defines the sorting logic. It compares strings based on their lengths.  If `s1` is shorter than `s2`, it returns a negative value. If `s1` is longer, it returns a positive value. If they are equal in length, it returns 0.

2. **`ReverseStringLengthComparator` Class:**
   - Similar to `StringLengthComparator`, but it sorts in reverse order of string length.

3. **`main` Method:**
   - A `TreeMap` is created using the `StringLengthComparator` in its constructor. This tells the `TreeMap` to use this comparator to sort its keys.
   - Key-value pairs are added to the `TreeMap`.
   - The `TreeMap` is printed. The output will show the entries sorted by key length.


**Output:**
