   This tells the `TreeMap` to use the `StringLengthComparator`'s `compare` method to sort the keys.


3. **Adding Elements:** We add key-value pairs to the `TreeMap`.

4. **Printing the Sorted `TreeMap`:**  When we print the `TreeMap`, the keys are automatically sorted according to the `compare` method in our custom comparator.


5. **Demonstrating `compare`:** The code also explicitly demonstrates how the `compare` method of the `StringLengthComparator` can be used.  This helps illustrate how the comparison logic works within the comparator.



Key Improvements:

- **Clearer Explanation:** The explanation breaks down the code's functionality step by step.
- **`compare` Method Demonstration:**  Added code to show how `compare` works, which helps understanding.
- **Conciseness:**  Removed unnecessary comments and made the code more concise.
- **Adherence to Prompt:** The solution strictly adheres to the prompt's requirement of only using `main` and `compare` method signatures.
