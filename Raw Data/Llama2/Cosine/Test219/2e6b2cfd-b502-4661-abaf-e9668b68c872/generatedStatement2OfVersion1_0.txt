**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Comparator Class:** The `StringLengthComparator` class implements the `Comparator<String>` interface.  This is crucial for custom sorting logic.

2. **compare Method:** The `compare(String s1, String s2)` method inside the `StringLengthComparator` now uses `Integer.compare(s1.length(), s2.length())`. This is a concise and preferred way to compare lengths as it handles potential integer overflow issues correctly.

3. **TreeMap Creation:**  The `TreeMap` is initialized with an instance of the `StringLengthComparator`:  `TreeMap<String, Integer> treeMap = new TreeMap<>(new StringLengthComparator());`.  This tells the `TreeMap` to use your custom sorting logic.

4. **Reversed Order (Optional):** The example also shows how to easily reverse the sorting order using `reversed()`: `new TreeMap<>(new StringLengthComparator().reversed());`


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `TreeMapSortComparator.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac TreeMapSortComparator.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java TreeMapSortComparator`



The output will show the TreeMap entries sorted first by string length (shortest to longest), and then in the second example, sorted by string length from longest to shortest.
