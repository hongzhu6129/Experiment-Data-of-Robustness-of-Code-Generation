**Explanation of "Beside" and the Code:**

1. **"Beside" Concept:** I've interpreted "beside" to mean that two sets have *no elements in common*.  This is equivalent to saying their intersection is empty.  If you had a different definition of "beside" in mind, please clarify, and I'll adjust the code accordingly.

2. **`isBeside()` Method:** This method efficiently determines if two sets are "beside" each other.  It creates a copy of `set1`, then uses `retainAll(set2)` to keep only the elements that are *also* in `set2`.  If the resulting `intersection` set is empty, the original sets were "beside" each other.

3. **`createSet()` Helper:**  This function simplifies the creation of `HashSet` objects for the test cases, making the `main` method cleaner.

4. **Test Cases:**  The `main` method includes several test cases demonstrating various scenarios, including empty sets, sets with overlap, and sets that are beside each other.  The output clearly shows whether each pair of sets meets the "beside" condition.

**How to Use:**

1. Save the code as `HashSetBeside.java`.
2. Compile: `javac HashSetBeside.java`
3. Run: `java HashSetBeside`

The output will show the results of the test cases, indicating whether each pair of sets is "beside" each other according to the definition used.
