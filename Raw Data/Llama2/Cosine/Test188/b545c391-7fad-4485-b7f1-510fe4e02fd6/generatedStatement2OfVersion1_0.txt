Key improvements and explanations in this version:

* **Clearer Examples:** The code now includes distinct examples demonstrating removing by object/value and removing by index.  It also shows how to remove *all* occurrences of a value.
* **Error Handling:**  The index-based removal now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. This makes the code more robust.
* **Duplicate Removal Example:** The code shows how to remove *all instances* of a specified element using a `while` loop and `remove(Object)`. This is important for cases where duplicates might exist.
* **Comments:**  The code has been commented more thoroughly to explain the different approaches and potential issues.
* **Conciseness:**  While providing comprehensive examples, the code remains focused and easy to understand.
