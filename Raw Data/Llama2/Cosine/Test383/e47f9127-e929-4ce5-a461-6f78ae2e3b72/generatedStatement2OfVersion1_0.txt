Key improvements and explanations in this code:

1. **Clearer Method Demonstrations:** The code clearly demonstrates two primary ways to create a max priority queue:
   - Using `Collections.reverseOrder()`:  This is a concise and common approach.
   - Using a lambda expression: This provides more flexibility and is especially useful for custom comparisons (e.g., with objects).

2. **Example with Strings:** An example demonstrating how to create a max priority queue for strings (alphabetical order) has been added.

3. **Concise Comments and Output:** The code includes comments explaining the logic and expected output, making it easier to understand.

4. **Improved Formatting:** Consistent indentation and spacing enhance readability.


This revised version provides a more comprehensive and user-friendly solution to the problem.
