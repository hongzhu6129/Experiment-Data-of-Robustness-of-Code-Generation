Explanation:

1. **Node Class:**  Represents a node in the binary tree. Each node has data, a left child, and a right child.

2. **maxDepth(Node root):** This recursive method calculates the maximum depth.
   - **Base Case:** If the `root` is `null` (empty tree or we've reached the end of a path), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:** Otherwise, we recursively calculate the `leftDepth` and `rightDepth`. The maximum depth of the current node is then the maximum of these two depths, plus 1 (to account for the current node itself).

3. **main(String[] args):** 
   - Creates a `BinaryTreeMaxDepth` object.
   - Constructs sample binary trees using the `Node` class.
   - Calls the `maxDepth()` method to find the maximum depth and prints the result. I've included two examples to demonstrate how it works with different tree structures.
