Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:** Correctly handles empty and null arrays.
- **Clearer output:**  The `main` method now prints the new length *and* shows the updated contents of the array (up to the new length).  I use `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid printing the original, longer array's contents after the unique elements. This makes it much easier to verify the results.
- **More comprehensive test cases:**  Added tests for empty, null, and all-unique element arrays.  This makes the testing more robust.


The core logic of `removeDuplicates` remains efficient � it modifies the array in-place and only iterates through it once, so it has O(n) time complexity.
