**Corner Cases (though not strictly applicable in this extremely simple example):**

This program doesn't have any true corner cases because it doesn't take any external inputs.  Corner cases usually arise when input values are at the extreme ends of acceptable ranges or have unusual properties.  However, we could consider these theoretical "corner cases" in a broader context:


* **System.out Error:** While rare, it's conceivable that `System.out` could be unavailable or encounter an error during printing.  Robust, production-level Java code (especially in server-side applications) would typically include error handling (try-catch blocks) to deal with such possibilities.  However, it's not usually necessary for a simple "Hello, World" program.
* **Extremely Long Name:** Though highly unlikely to be a practical issue, you could theoretically have an extremely long name that might cause some output buffering issues.  However, Java's `println()` handles very long strings efficiently, so it's not a major concern.




This enhanced explanation provides more comprehensive testing strategies, especially useful if the program were to become more complex in the future.
