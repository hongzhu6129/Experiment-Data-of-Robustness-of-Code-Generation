Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles 0 correctly:**  The previous version had an issue where an input of `0` or negative numbers resulted in an empty string. It now handles `n=0` by simply returning "" and throws an IllegalArgumentException for negative input values.
* **More concise and readable:** The code is slightly more compact and easier to follow.  The logic within the `while` loop is more straightforward.
* **Comprehensive test cases:** The `main` method now includes a more diverse set of test cases, including edge cases like 26, 52, 701, 702, 703, and larger numbers like 16384 to demonstrate correct functionality across a wider range.


This revised code directly addresses the problem description and provides a robust and correct solution for converting column numbers to Excel column names.
