        int[] arr4 = {20, 1, 20, 3, 4, 20, 6, 7}; // Valid

        boolean adjacent = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == 20) {
                count++;
                if (i > 0 && arr[i - 1] == 20) { // Check for adjacency
                    adjacent = true;
                    break; // No need to continue if adjacent 20s are found
                }
            }
        }

        return count == 3 && !adjacent; // Return true if exactly three 20s and no adjacent 20s
    }
}
```


Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `adjacent` instead of a generic name like `flag` makes the code's purpose more evident.

2. **Early Exit:**  The `break` statement inside the adjacency check improves efficiency.  Once adjacent 20s are found, there's no need to process the rest of the array.

3. **Combined Return Condition:** The final `return` statement clearly combines the two required conditions: three 20s and no adjacent 20s.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method now demonstrates the function with multiple test cases, showing how it handles different scenarios (valid and invalid arrangements of 20s).

5. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic within the `check20s` method.


This revised code is more efficient, readable, and easier to understand. It clearly addresses the problem statement's requirements and provides good examples of its usage.
