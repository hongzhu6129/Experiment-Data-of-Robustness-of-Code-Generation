Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Separation:**  The code now clearly separates the different approaches (recursive memoization, iterative DP, and the combinations approach) into distinct private helper methods. This enhances readability and organization.

2. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic of each approach and important steps within the methods.

3. **Base Cases:**  The recursive method now handles base cases for invalid inputs (m < 1 or n < 1) more explicitly.

4. **Iterative DP Efficiency:** The iterative DP approach is now the default (uncommented) solution, as it is generally more efficient than the recursive memoization approach in Java due to function call overhead.
