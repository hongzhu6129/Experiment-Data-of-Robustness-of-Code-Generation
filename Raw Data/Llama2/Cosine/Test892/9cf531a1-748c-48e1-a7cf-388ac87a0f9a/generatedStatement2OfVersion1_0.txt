Key improvements in this code:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  Improved comments and formatting make the code easier to understand.
* **Specificity for GMT:** Addresses the deprecation of "GMT" and provides a dedicated section to find time zones starting with "GMT" or "Etc/GMT," ensuring more accurate representation.
* **Use of ZonedDateTime:**  `ZonedDateTime` provides a more comprehensive representation of a time instant with a time zone, including the date and time. This gives a clearer picture of the time border.
* **Direct `ZoneId.of()`:** Using `ZoneId.of(zoneId)` is a more direct and preferred way to get a `ZoneId` instance.


This revised version provides a more complete and accurate solution to the problem of displaying available time zones in UTC and GMT. It also addresses potential issues with deprecated time zone IDs.
