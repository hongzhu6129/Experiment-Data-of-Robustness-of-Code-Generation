**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Value Assignment:** The original prompt lacked specifics on what the matrix should contain. I've used  `(i + j) % 2` as a simple example to create an alternating pattern of 0s and 1s.  You can modify this based on your desired matrix content (e.g., a diagonal, specific numbers, etc.).

2. **Space Management:** Added a space after each number printed to ensure the matrix is formatted correctly.

3. **Newline:**  `System.out.println()` after the inner loop ensures each row is printed on a new line, creating the matrix visualization.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to call the `printMatrix` method.
