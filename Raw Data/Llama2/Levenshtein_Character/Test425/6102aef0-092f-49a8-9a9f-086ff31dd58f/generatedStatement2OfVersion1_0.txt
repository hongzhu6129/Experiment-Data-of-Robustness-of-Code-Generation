Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Method Extraction:**  The `isCube()` method is now separate, making the code more organized and reusable.
2. **Handling Negative Numbers:** The `isCube()` method correctly handles negative cubes. The cube root of a negative number is simply the negative of the cube root of its absolute value.
3. **Efficient Cube Root Calculation:** The code uses `Math.cbrt()` to directly calculate the cube root, which is more efficient than looping or iterative approaches. We cast the result to `int` and round to the nearest integer because `Math.cbrt()` returns a `double`.
4. **Clearer Output:** The output messages are more informative.
5. **Optional Loop Approach (Commented Out):** I've included a loop-based approach as a comment for comparison. It's less efficient but demonstrates a basic iterative method. The loop also includes an optimization to break early if `i*i*i` exceeds the input number.  The `Math.cbrt` approach is generally preferred.



How to use with User Input:

To take user input, you can modify the `main` method like this:
