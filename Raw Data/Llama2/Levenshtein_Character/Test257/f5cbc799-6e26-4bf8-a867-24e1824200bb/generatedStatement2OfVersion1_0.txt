This revised code adheres strictly to the requested method signatures. `main` now calls a helper function  `displayFirst50PentagonalNumbers` which handles the looping and printing logic, keeping `getPentagonalNumber` focused solely on calculating individual pentagonal numbers.  The output is also formatted to be more readable.
