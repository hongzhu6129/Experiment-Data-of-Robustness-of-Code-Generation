Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer ZoneId definitions:**  Uses `ZoneId.of()` for cleaner zone specification.
* **ZonedDateTime:** Uses `ZonedDateTime` which is the preferred way to work with time zones in Java.  It handles daylight savings correctly.
* **Improved `formatOffset()`:**
    * Handles both positive and negative offsets correctly.
    * Formats the offset as `GMT+HH:MM` or `GMT-HH:MM`, including leading zeros. Uses absolute values in the format string to ensure correct formatting regardless of the sign.
* **Example with `DateTimeFormatter`:** Added an example showing how to use `DateTimeFormatter` to directly format the date and time with the offset, which is often a more convenient approach.



This revised code offers a more robust and practical solution for defining and extracting zone offsets in Java, addressing the potential issues of the previous versions and incorporating best practices.
