**Explanation and Correction:**

The original prompt had a couple of issues:

1. **Incorrect Formula/Sign Error:** The provided formula `p = 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) + (1/9) - (1/11).. )` is incorrect.  The signs should alternate.  It should be `4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) - (1/7) + (1/9) - (1/11) + ... )`
2. **Unclear Instruction:** The instruction "use 1.0 instead of 1 in your program" was a bit ambiguous, but in the context of Java and floating-point calculations, it means to use floating-point literals (like `1.0` or `3.0`) instead of integer literals (like `1` or `3`) to ensure that the division operations produce accurate decimal results.

The corrected code above addresses these issues:

* It uses the correct alternating signs in the Leibniz formula for pi.
* It uses `1.0`, `3.0`, etc., to ensure floating-point division.
* It calculates the approximations up to 1/11 and 1/13 as requested.



**Key improvements:**

* **Clarity:** The code is now more readable and easier to understand, with clear variable names and comments.
* **Accuracy:** The corrected formula and use of floating-point numbers provide a more accurate approximation of pi.
* **Conciseness:** The code is written efficiently, avoiding unnecessary complexities.
