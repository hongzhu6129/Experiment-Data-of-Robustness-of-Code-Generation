Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Corrected Formula:** The provided formula in the prompt had a `+ (1/9)` which should have been `- (1/7)` to follow the alternating signs pattern of the Leibniz formula for pi. The code now correctly uses alternating addition and subtraction.
2. **Double Precision:**  Using `1.0` instead of `1` ensures that the calculations are performed using floating-point arithmetic (doubles) for greater precision, avoiding integer division issues which would lead to incorrect results.
3. **Clearer Output:** The `println` statements now label the two approximations clearly, making the output easier to understand. 
4. **Conciseness:** The code is written efficiently, directly calculating and printing the two requested approximations within the `main` method.


This revised code accurately implements the Leibniz formula for pi approximation up to the specified terms and produces the correct results.
