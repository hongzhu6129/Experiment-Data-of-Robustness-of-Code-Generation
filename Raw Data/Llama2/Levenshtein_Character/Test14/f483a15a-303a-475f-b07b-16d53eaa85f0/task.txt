Problem Description : \n3.1 (Algebra: solve quadratic equations) The two roots of a quadratic equation can be obtained. If it is positive, the\nequation has two real roots. If it is zero, the equation has one root. If it is negative,\nthe equation has no real roots.\nWrite a program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displays\nthe result based on the discriminant. If the discriminant is positive, display two\nroots. If the discriminant is 0, display one root. Otherwise, display The equation\nhas no real roots.\n\n The programming language you need to use is: Java.\n\n Problem Id is : f483a15a-303a-475f-b07b-16d53eaa85f0.
