Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`6k � 1` Optimization in `is_Prime()`:** All prime numbers greater than 3 can be expressed in the form `6k � 1` (where `k` is any integer).  This allows us to check only numbers of this form, significantly reducing the number of iterations.

2. **Optimized Loop in `main()`:** The loop starts from 3 and increments by 2.  Since twin primes are always odd (except for (3,5)), checking even numbers is redundant.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** `n` is used instead of potentially ambiguous names like `num`.

4. **Concise Code:**  Removed unnecessary comments and code blocks.  The logic is now more straightforward and easier to understand.

5. **Correct Handling of Edge Cases:** The `is_Prime` function correctly handles cases for numbers less than or equal to 3.


This revised code provides a more efficient and readable solution for finding twin primes less than 100 while adhering to the specified method signatures.
