**Explanation and Fix for the Original Error:**

The error "invalid literal for int() with base 10: '3.0'" arises because `Integer.parseInt()` is designed to convert strings representing *whole numbers* (integers) into their integer equivalents.  "3.0" is a floating-point representation, so it cannot be directly parsed as an integer using this method.

The provided code addresses this by:

1. **Using a `try-catch` block:**  This is the recommended approach to handle potential `NumberFormatException` errors, which occur when the string cannot be parsed as an integer.

2. **Handling the exception:** Inside the `catch` block, we output the specific string format requested in the problem description, using the original input string ("3.0") instead of attempting an integer conversion.  

**If the intention was to work with the numeric value 3.0, then instead of `Integer.parseInt()`, use `Double.parseDouble()`:**
