To compile and run this code:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `GetChangeTimestamp.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:  `javac GetChangeTimestamp.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code, providing the file path as an argument:  `java GetChangeTimestamp /path/to/your/file`  (Replace `/path/to/your/file` with the actual path to the file you want to check).


This improved version:

- **Handles missing file paths:** It checks if the provided file path exists and prints an error message if it doesn't.
- **Uses NIO.2:**  It utilizes the `java.nio.file` package, which is the modern way to work with files and directories in Java.
- **Clearer error handling:** It catches `IOException` and prints a more informative error message.
- **Formatted Date Output:** It formats the date and time of the last modification for better readability.  You can customize the date format string (`yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`) in the `SimpleDateFormat` if needed.
