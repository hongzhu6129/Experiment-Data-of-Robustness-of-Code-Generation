**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`long` Data Type:** Using `long` instead of `int` allows us to store larger Fermat numbers.  However, even `long` will overflow after the 5th Fermat number.
2. **Overflow Handling:** The code now checks for overflow. If the calculated `fermatNumber` becomes negative (due to exceeding the maximum value of `long`), it prints an "overflow" message. This makes the output more informative.
3. **Clearer Output:** The output now indicates which Fermat number (F0, F1, etc.) is being displayed and when overflow occurs.
4. **Efficiency:**  While `Math.pow()` is used for clarity, it can be slightly inefficient for integer exponents.  For better performance (especially for very large values where `BigInteger` would be needed), bitwise operations could be used instead of `Math.pow(2, n)`:
