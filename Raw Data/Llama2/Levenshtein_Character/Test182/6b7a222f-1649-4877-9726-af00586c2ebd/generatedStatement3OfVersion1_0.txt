The `BigInteger` version is more robust for calculating larger Fermat numbers and will not overflow.  The `intValueExact()` ensures we don't lose information converting the exponent from BigInteger to an int for small values of i.


Choose the version (`long` or `BigInteger`) that's appropriate for the range of Fermat numbers you need to calculate.  If there's a possibility of exceeding the capacity of `long`, use `BigInteger` to avoid errors.
