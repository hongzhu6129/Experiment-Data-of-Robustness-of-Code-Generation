**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`calculateFermatNumber(int n)` Method:**
   - This helper method encapsulates the Fermat number calculation, making the `main` method cleaner.
   - It uses `Math.pow()` to compute 2^(2^n), and then adds 1.
   - The result is cast to `long` because Fermat numbers grow very rapidly and can exceed the capacity of `int`.

2. **`main` Method:**
   - It loops from `n = 0` to `n = 9` (inclusive) to calculate the first 10 Fermat numbers.
   - It prints each Fermat number to the console.

3. **Handling Large Numbers:**
   - Even with `long`, Fermat numbers beyond the first few will exceed its capacity.  For larger values of `n`, you'd need to use `BigInteger` if you want accurate representations (see the improved version below).
