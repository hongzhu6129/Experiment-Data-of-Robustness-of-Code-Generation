**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`calculateFermatNumber(int n)` Method:**  This helper method calculates the Fermat number for a given `n`.  It uses `Math.pow()` to perform the exponentiation.  The result is cast to `long` because Fermat numbers grow very quickly, exceeding the capacity of `int` even for small values of `n`.

2. **`main` Method:**
   - It prints a clear header.
   - The loop iterates from `n = 0` to `n = 9` (inclusive) to calculate and print the first 10 Fermat numbers.
   - It calls the `calculateFermatNumber` method to get each Fermat number.

3. **Long Data Type:** Using `long` allows the program to handle larger Fermat numbers than if `int` were used. However, even `long` will not be able to store all Fermat numbers beyond the first few, as they become extremely large. For truly large Fermat numbers, you would need to use `BigInteger` (see further improvement below).

**Further Improvement (Using BigInteger for Arbitrary Precision):**

If you need to handle even larger Fermat numbers, you can use the `BigInteger` class, which supports arbitrary-precision integers:
