**Important Note:** The prompt mentions Fermat numbers, but asks for Diophantine numbers.  The question body also has a series of floating-point numbers (3.0, 5.0, etc.) that seem unrelated to either Diophantine or Fermat numbers. This solution focuses on generating Diophantine numbers as clearly requested in the main prompt and provides an explanation of their mathematical properties.   If you actually wanted Fermat numbers, the logic in `main` would need to be completely different.  If you need code to generate Fermat numbers instead, please clarify.
