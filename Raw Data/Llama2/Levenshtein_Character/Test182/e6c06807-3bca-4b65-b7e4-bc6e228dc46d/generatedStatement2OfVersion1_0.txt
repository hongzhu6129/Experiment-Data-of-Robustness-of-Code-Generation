**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Data Type:**  Fermat numbers grow very rapidly.  Using `int` would lead to overflow very quickly. We use `long` to store the Fermat numbers, providing a larger range. However, even `long` will not be sufficient for all 10 Fermat numbers.  After the 5th Fermat number, they exceed the capacity of `long`.
2. **Calculation:** The formula for a Fermat number is 2^(2^n) + 1.  We use `Math.pow()` to calculate the powers. The result of `Math.pow()` is a `double`, so we cast it to `long` before storing it in `fermatNumber`.
3. **Output:** The code prints the first 10 calculated values. It's important to be aware that the values beyond the 5th will not be accurate due to the limitations of `long`.

**Handling Large Numbers (BigInteger):**

To correctly calculate and display all 10 Fermat numbers without overflow, you would need to use `BigInteger` from the `java.math` package:
