**Test Cases:**

While this program doesn't take any input, we can still consider some aspects for testing, focusing primarily on the output format:

1. **Basic Functionality Test:**  Verify the program prints the poem correctly with the specified indentation. This is the primary test case.  You can do this visually or by redirecting the output to a file and comparing it to the expected output.

2. **Whitespace Sensitivity Test (Indirect):**  Java's `println()` handles newline characters (`\n`) and tabs (`\t`) directly.  We're not manipulating strings in a way where extra spaces or incorrect whitespace could be introduced easily. So, a direct test for this is less critical here. However, carefully examine the output to ensure the spacing matches the requirement.

3. **Character Encoding Test (Corner Case - Less likely but possible):**  If you're dealing with different character encodings (e.g., UTF-8, ASCII), there's a very remote chance you could encounter issues with special characters like commas or apostrophes.  Try running the program in different environments/locales (if applicable) to check if the output remains consistent. This is more relevant if you were reading the poem from an external file.

4. **Output Redirection Test (If applicable):** If your program is designed to output to a file or other stream instead of the console, test that the output is correctly written to the intended destination with the proper formatting.


**How to test output visually:**

Run the program and compare its output in your console to the desired output:
