**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Empty Array:**  Added a check at the beginning to handle the case where the input array is empty. This prevents potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
2. **Clearer Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` is used instead of just `i` (for the index tracking unique elements) to make the code's purpose more obvious.
3. **In-place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` function modifies the original `nums` array directly (in-place) as requested by the problem.  The unique elements are placed at the beginning of the array.
4. **Return Value:**  The function returns the length of the updated array (the number of unique elements).
5. **Comprehensive `main` method:** The `main` method provides several test cases (including an empty array and an array with no duplicates) to demonstrate the functionality.
6. **Outputting the modified array:** The `main` method uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant portion of the modified array (up to the new length), avoiding displaying the unmodified elements after the unique values.  This makes the output clearer.



This improved version addresses potential issues and provides clearer, more robust code while adhering to the given method signature requirements.
