Key improvements:

* **Handles Edge Cases**: The code now explicitly handles cases like an empty array, `k` being larger than the array size, `k` being zero or negative and also handles duplicate values in the input array. This makes it much more robust.
* **Clearer Output**: The output is formatted more clearly, stating explicitly what the `k` largest elements are.
* **Efficiency**: Using a `PriorityQueue` (min-heap) is an efficient way to solve this problem, especially for large arrays and relatively small values of `k`.  The time complexity is O(n log k), where n is the size of the array.
* **Optional Sorting**:  I added `Arrays.sort(kLargest)` to present the `k` largest elements in ascending order which is often the expected output format. You can easily remove this line if you don't need sorted output.  If you omit the sorting the order of the k largest elements will reflect the insertion order into the `PriorityQueue`.
