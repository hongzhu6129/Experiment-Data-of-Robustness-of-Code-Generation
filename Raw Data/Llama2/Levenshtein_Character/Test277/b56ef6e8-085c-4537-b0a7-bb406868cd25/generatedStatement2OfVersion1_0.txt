Key improvements and explanations in this code:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `k` to represent the index of the next unique element makes the code more readable.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes explicit checks for `null` or empty input arrays, preventing potential `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

3. **In-Place Modification:** The code modifies the original array `nums` directly, fulfilling the in-place requirement. The function returns the new length `k`, which indicates the portion of the array containing the unique elements.

4. **Concise and Efficient:**  The logic is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity.

5. **Comprehensive Main Method:** The `main` method demonstrates several test cases, including empty and null arrays, providing thorough examples of how to use the `removeDuplicates` method and interpret its results using `Arrays.copyOfRange`.  This makes testing and understanding the code much easier.
