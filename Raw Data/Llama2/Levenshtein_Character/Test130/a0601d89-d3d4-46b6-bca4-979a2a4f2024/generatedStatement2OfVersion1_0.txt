Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `ParseException` if the input string doesn't match the specified format. This prevents the program from crashing and provides a user-friendly error message.
* **Clearer Output:**  The output now clearly labels the converted dates.
* **Demonstrates Different Formats:** The `main` method includes examples of converting strings with different date formats, showing the flexibility of the `SimpleDateFormat` class.  This makes the code more educational and practical.
* **Helper Method:** The conversion logic is now encapsulated in a private helper method `convertStringToDate`, which makes the `main` method cleaner and easier to read.  This is good practice for code organization.


This improved version is more robust, informative, and demonstrates better coding practices.
