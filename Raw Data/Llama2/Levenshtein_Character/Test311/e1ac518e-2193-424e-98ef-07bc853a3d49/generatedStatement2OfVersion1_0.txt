Key improvements and explanations in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles empty arrays and null inputs.
* **Clearer variable naming:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive.
* **In-place modification:**  Modifies the original array directly as requested.
* **Comprehensive `main` method:** Includes various test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs (empty array, null, duplicates, no duplicates).
* **Output formatting:** The `main` method now prints the updated array content (only the relevant part after removing duplicates) alongside the new length, making it easier to verify the results.  It uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to achieve this.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to clarify the logic.




This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and demonstrates the function's behavior with multiple examples.
