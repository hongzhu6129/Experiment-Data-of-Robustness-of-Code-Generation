Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles the case where `startKey` is greater than `endKey` � no filling occurs.
* **Clearer comments and explanations:** Improved comments make the code easier to understand.
* **More comprehensive examples:** Added more examples in `main` to demonstrate different scenarios, including an empty submap and an invalid range.
* **Uses `subMap` directly:**  Now correctly uses `subMap.put()` to modify the submap (and therefore the original map) directly, which is more efficient and avoids unnecessary looping.
* **Correct inclusivity/exclusivity:** Uses the correct boolean parameters in `subMap` to ensure that the range from `startKey` to `endKey` is inclusive on both ends.
