Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Method Names:**  `count_nums_not_7` is descriptive.
* **Helper Function:**  The `containsDigit7` function makes the logic easier to understand and reuse.
* **Comments:**  Explaining the purpose of each method and section of code.
* **Test Cases:** The `main` method demonstrates usage and expected outputs.
* **Efficiency:**  While the solution isn't optimized for extremely large numbers, it's clear and correct for typical use cases.  For massive ranges, a more mathematically sophisticated approach might be necessary, but this version adheres to the requested method signatures.
