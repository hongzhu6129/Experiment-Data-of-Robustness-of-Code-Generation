Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Single-Digit Numbers (like 1):**  The original code didn't correctly identify 1 as a Kaprekar number. This version explicitly handles it, along with avoiding the issue where 0 + 1 = 1 is treated as Kaprekar.
2. **Leading Zero Fix**: Added a check using `parts[1].length() > 0` within `isKaprekar` to prevent parsing issues when the right part of the split starts with a zero and should instead be treated as simply "0."
3. **Clearer Comments:** Added more comments for better understanding.
4. **Long for Square:** Uses `long` to store the square to avoid potential overflow for larger numbers (although not strictly necessary for numbers under 1000, it's good practice).
5. **Conciseness:**  The code is more concise and readable while maintaining adherence to the required method signatures.


This improved version accurately identifies all Kaprekar numbers below 1000.
