Key improvements in this revised code:

1. **Handles Single-Digit Numbers:** The `split_num` function now correctly handles cases like 1 and 9 where the square has fewer digits than the original number.  It does this by setting `left` to "0" if the left substring is empty.

2. **Avoids "0" in the Right Part:** The `isKaprekar` function now explicitly checks if the right part of the split is "0" and returns `false` in that case.  This is important because a Kaprekar number's right part shouldn't be zero.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output now prints the count of Kaprekar numbers and then each Kaprekar number along with its square and the split, making it easier to understand the results.

4. **Long for Squares:**  Uses `long` to store the square to avoid potential integer overflow for larger numbers.

5. **NumberFormatException Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the split strings cannot be parsed as integers.



Now, the output will be correct and more informative:
