Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles single-digit squares correctly:** The `split_num` method now handles cases where splitting a single-digit square (like 1*1 = 1 or 2*2 = 4) results in an empty string for one of the parts.  It now assigns "0" in these cases, ensuring the addition works as intended.
* **Handles leading zeros in the second part**:  The code explicitly checks if the second part is an empty string (which could happen if the split point is at the very end of the number). This avoids `NumberFormatException` in such scenarios.
* **Clearer explanation and comments**: The comments make the code easier to understand and maintain.
* **Correct output formatting**:  The output now matches the format specified in your prompt.




This improved version addresses the potential issues related to single-digit squares and leading/trailing zeros, making it more robust and reliable.
