Explanation within the `main` method:

1. **Create a TreeMap:**  `TreeMap<String, Integer> bookMap = new TreeMap<>();`  This creates a new TreeMap where keys are Strings (book titles) and values are Integers (publication years). TreeMaps store elements in a sorted order based on the natural ordering of the keys (alphabetical order in this case for Strings).

2. **Associate values with keys (using put()):**  `bookMap.put("Book Title", PublicationYear);`  The `put()` method is used to add key-value pairs to the TreeMap.

3. **Print the TreeMap:**  `System.out.println(bookMap);` This prints the contents of the TreeMap to the console, which is a good way to see the key-value associations.

4. **Retrieve a value using a key (using get()):** `int publicationYear = bookMap.get("The Lord of the Rings");`  The `get()` method is used to retrieve the value associated with a given key.  If the key is not found, `get()` returns `null`.

5. **Update an Existing Value:** The `put()` method will update the value associated with a key if that key already exists in the TreeMap. This is demonstrated in the example.

6. **Retrieving a Non-Existent Value:** The example shows what happens when you try to retrieve a value using a key that isn't present in the map � the `get()` method returns `null`.  This is important to handle in your code to prevent `NullPointerExceptions`.
