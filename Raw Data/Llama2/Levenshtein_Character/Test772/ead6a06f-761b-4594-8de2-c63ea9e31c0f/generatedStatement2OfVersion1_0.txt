Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles Edge Cases:**  Explicitly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays.
- **Clearer Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `i`.
- **Improved Comments:** Comments explain the logic clearly.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method includes various test cases, including edge cases and a case with no duplicates, to demonstrate the function's correctness.
- **Output Formatting:**  Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange()` and `Arrays.toString()` in the main method to print only the relevant portion of the modified array, making the output easier to understand.  It also handles the `null` case gracefully.


This revised answer is more robust and provides a better demonstration of how the `removeDuplicates` function works.
