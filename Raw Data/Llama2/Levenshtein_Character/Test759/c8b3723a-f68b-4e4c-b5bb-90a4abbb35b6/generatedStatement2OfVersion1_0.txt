This code replicates the exact output provided, including the "pct" on the 6th row, assuming that was intentional in the original prompt.  If it was a typo, and you want consistent rows, simply remove the special case for row 6 and allow the main loop to handle it like the other rows.  It also makes sure to properly space the "stars" and uses nested loops to more clearly define the structure of the flag pattern.
