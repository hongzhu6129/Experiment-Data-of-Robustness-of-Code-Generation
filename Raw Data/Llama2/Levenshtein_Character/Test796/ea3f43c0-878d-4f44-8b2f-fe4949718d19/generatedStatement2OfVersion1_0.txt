Explanation and Key Improvements:

1. **Handles Empty and Null Input:**  The code now correctly handles cases where the input array is empty or null, returning 0 as expected.
2. **Clearer Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` more clearly indicates the purpose of the variable.
3. **In-Place Modification:** The code directly modifies the input array `nums` without using extra space, as required by the problem.
4. **Concise Logic:** The core logic for removing duplicates is efficient and easy to understand.
5. **Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method includes tests with various inputs, including edge cases (empty and null array), to demonstrate correctness.
6. **Output Clarity:** The `main` method prints the new length and the modified portion of the array (up to the new length) for better visualization of the result.  `Arrays.copyOfRange` is used to avoid displaying the unmodified part of the original array.



This improved version addresses the potential issues and provides a more robust and clear solution to the problem.
