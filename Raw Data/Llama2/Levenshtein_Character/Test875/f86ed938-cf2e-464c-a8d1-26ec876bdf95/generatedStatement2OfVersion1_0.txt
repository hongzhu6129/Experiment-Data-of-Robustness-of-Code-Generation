Explanation and Improvements:

1. **User Input:** The code takes two date strings as input from the user via the `Scanner` class.  It prompts the user to enter the dates in "yyyy-MM-dd" format.

2. **Date Parsing:**  It uses `DateTimeFormatter` and `LocalDate.parse()` to convert the input strings into `LocalDate` objects. This is crucial for robust date handling. The `try-catch` block handles potential `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters an invalid date format.

3. **Calculating the Difference:** The `Period.between()` method efficiently calculates the difference between the two `LocalDate` objects, storing the result in a `Period` object.

4. **Outputting the Result:** The code then prints the difference in years, months, and days using `difference.getYears()`, `difference.getMonths()`, and `difference.getDays()`.

5. **Error Handling:** The included `try-catch` block makes the code more robust by handling the case where the user might input an incorrectly formatted date.  This prevents the program from crashing.
