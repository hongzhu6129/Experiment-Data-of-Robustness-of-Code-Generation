Key improvements and explanations in this code:

1. **TreeMap for Sorted Keys:**  `TreeMap` is crucial because it keeps the keys sorted, which is essential for efficiently getting a portion based on key comparisons.

2. **tailMap() Method:** The `tailMap(givenKey)` method is the core of the solution. It directly returns a `SortedMap` containing all entries with keys greater than or equal to `givenKey`.

3. **Clearer Output:** The `println` statements are more informative, showing the original `givenKey` and the resulting `subMap`.

4. **Handling String Keys:** The code demonstrates how to use `TreeMap` and `tailMap()` with `String` keys as well. Strings are compared lexicographically (alphabetical order).

5. **Inclusive vs. Exclusive:** Shows how to get both inclusive (greater than or equal to) and exclusive (strictly greater than) submaps.  The `higherKey()` method is used to find the next key for the exclusive case, handling the scenario where `givenStringKey` is the largest key.
