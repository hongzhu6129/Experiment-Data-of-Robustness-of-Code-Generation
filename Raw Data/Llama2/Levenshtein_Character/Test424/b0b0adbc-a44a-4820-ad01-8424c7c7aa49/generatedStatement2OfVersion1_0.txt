**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner/edge cases, to thoroughly test the program:

* **Normal Case:**
    * Input: `10 20 30`
    * Expected Output: `20.0`

* **Negative Numbers:**
    * Input: `-5 0 5`
    * Expected Output: `0.0`

* **Large Numbers:**
    * Input: `1000000 2000000 3000000`
    * Expected Output: `2000000.0`

* **Zeroes:**
    * Input: `0 0 0`
    * Expected Output: `0.0`

* **Mixed Positive and Negative:**
    * Input: `-10 20 -30`
    * Expected Output: `-6.666666666666667`

* **Integer Overflow (Edge Case):**
    * Input: `Integer.MAX_VALUE Integer.MAX_VALUE Integer.MAX_VALUE`
    * Expected Output: `(Should handle potential overflow and produce a reasonably accurate, though possibly not perfect, result.  Due to the limitations of `double`, you might see a slightly rounded result or even `Infinity`.)`

* **Integer Underflow (Edge Case):**
    * Input: `Integer.MIN_VALUE Integer.MIN_VALUE Integer.MIN_VALUE`
    * Expected Output: `(Similar to overflow - should handle gracefully and produce an approximate result or possibly -Infinity.)`

* **Invalid Input (Corner Case):**
    * Input: `10 a 20`
    * Expected Output: `"Invalid input. Please enter integers only."`

* **Invalid Input (Corner Case):**
    * Input: `10 20`  (Only two numbers)
    * Expected Output: `(The program should either handle this gracefully by prompting for the missing third number or terminate with an error message regarding insufficient input.) The current code will throw a `NoSuchElementException` if fewer than three numbers are entered.`

* **Invalid Input (Corner Case):**
    * Input: `10 20 30 40` (Too many numbers)
    * Expected Output: `(Ideally the program should either ignore extra input or provide feedback that only the first three numbers are considered). The provided code currently only takes the first three inputs.`


By testing these cases, you can ensure that your program handles a variety of inputs correctly, including potential error scenarios. This makes your program more robust and reliable.  The provided code now includes input validation and resource cleanup (closing the `Scanner`). This significantly enhances its robustness.
