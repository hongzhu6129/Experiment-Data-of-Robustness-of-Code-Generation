Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles empty (`{}`) and null arrays.
* **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` makes the purpose of the variable more obvious.
* **Improved comments:**  Comments explain the logic more thoroughly.
* **Comprehensive `main` method:**  Includes more test cases, including cases with no duplicates, an empty array, and a null array, demonstrating robust handling of various inputs.
* **Output Formatting:** Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` and `Arrays.toString` to print only the relevant part of the modified array, making the output cleaner and easier to understand.


This revised code addresses all the previous shortcomings and provides a complete and robust solution to the problem.  It adheres to the specified method signatures and follows best practices for Java coding.
