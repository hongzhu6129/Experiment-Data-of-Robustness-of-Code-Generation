**Test Cases:**

Here's a table of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| Negative Numbers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2 | 0 |
| Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Zero as num2 | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | "Division by zero" | "Division by zero" |
| Both Zero | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | "Division by zero" | "Division by zero" |
| Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000 | 2 | 0 |
| Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13 | 8 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0 |
| Integer and Decimal | 10 | 2.5 | 12.5 | 7.5 | 25 | 4 | 0|
| Negative Decimal Numbers | -10.5 | 2.5 | -8 | -13 | -26.25 | -4.2 | 0 |



**How to Run Test Cases (Manually):**

1.  Compile the Java code: `javac ArithmeticOperations.java`
2.  Run the compiled code: `java ArithmeticOperations`
3.  Enter the `num1` and `num2` values from the test case table when prompted.
4.  Compare the output with the expected results in the table.


**Automated Testing (Using JUnit - Recommended):**

While manual testing is fine for small programs, automated testing is much more efficient and reliable, especially for larger projects.  Here's how you'd write a simple JUnit test:
