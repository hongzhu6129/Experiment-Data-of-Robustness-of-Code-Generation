This JUnit test captures the output of `printFace()` and compares it to the expected string. The `\r\n` is important to handle Windows line endings. If you're on a Unix-like system (macOS/Linux), you would typically use `\n`.  Adjust the line separators as needed for your platform or use a platform-independent approach like `System.lineSeparator()`.
