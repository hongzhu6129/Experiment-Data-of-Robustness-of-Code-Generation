Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  It now correctly handles null or empty input strings.
* **Efficiency (optional):**  While the stack-based approach is clear, you could use `new StringBuilder(word).reverse().toString()` for a potentially more efficient reversal within `reverseWord()`. I've included that as a comment.
* **Clarity and Readability:**  Improved variable names and comments make the code easier to understand.
* **Trimmed Output:** Removes the trailing space that the previous version had.


This revised answer directly addresses the prompt's requirements and provides a robust solution.
