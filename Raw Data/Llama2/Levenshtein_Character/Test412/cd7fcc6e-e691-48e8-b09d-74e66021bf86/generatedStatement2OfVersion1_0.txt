Key improvements and educational aspects:

* **Clear Javadoc:**  Explains the purpose, parameters, and return value of the `binarySearch` method.
* **Overflow Prevention:**  Calculates `mid` using `low + (high - low) / 2` to avoid potential integer overflow if `low + high` is very large.
* **Comprehensive `main` Method:** Demonstrates both successful and unsuccessful searches.  Also, illustrates the importance of a sorted input array for binary search to work correctly.
* **Concise and Readable:** The code follows standard Java conventions and is easy to understand.


This revised code provides a better educational example for learning binary search in Java.  It is correct, robust, and clearly explains the key concepts involved.
