**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clear File Path:** The code now clearly shows how to specify the file path. You *must* replace `"path/to/your/file.txt"` with the actual path to your file.

2. **Try-with-resources:** This ensures that the `BufferedReader` and `FileReader` are automatically closed, even if an exception occurs. This is crucial for preventing resource leaks.

3. **Line-by-Line Reading:** The `readLine()` method reads the file one line at a time.  The loop continues until `readLine()` returns `null`, which indicates the end of the file.

4. **Process Each Line:** Inside the loop, you can process each `line` as needed.  The example simply prints it to the console.  You could modify this to perform other operations (e.g., store the lines in a list, search for specific text, etc.).

5. **Exception Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles potential `IOExceptions` (e.g., if the file doesn't exist).  This prevents the program from crashing and provides a user-friendly error message.

6. **Command-Line Arguments:** The added code demonstrates how to accept the file path as a command-line argument. This makes the program more flexible.  To run it with a command-line argument, you would use: `java ReadFileLineByLine myfile.txt` (where `myfile.txt` is the name of your file).


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ReadFileLineByLine.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac ReadFileLineByLine.java`
3. **Run:**  If you have hardcoded the file path: `java ReadFileLineByLine`
    * If using a command-line argument: `java ReadFileLineByLine path/to/your/file.txt`  (replace with the actual path)


This improved example is more robust, handles errors correctly, and demonstrates best practices for reading files in Java.
