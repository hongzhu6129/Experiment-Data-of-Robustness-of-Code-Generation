**Explanation and Key improvements:**

1. **Casting to double:**  Crucially, we cast `numerator` to `double` *before* the division.  This ensures that the division itself is performed using floating-point arithmetic, which gives us a more accurate result (including the fractional part). If we don't cast, integer division truncates the decimal portion, leading to incorrect rounding.

2. **Math.ceil():**  `Math.ceil()` is the correct function to use for rounding *up* towards positive infinity.  It takes a `double` argument and returns the smallest `double` value that is greater than or equal to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer.

3. **Casting back to int:**  After using `Math.ceil()`, we cast the result back to `int` to get the final rounded-up integer value.

4. **Clearer Output:**  The output now clearly labels the numerator, denominator, and the rounded-up result, making it easier to understand.

5. **More Examples:** The `demonstrateRounding()` helper function and additional examples in `main` illustrate the behavior of the rounding logic with various inputs, including negative numbers, which helps clarify edge cases and provides more comprehensive testing.


**How `Math.ceil()` handles different cases:**

* **Positive numerator, positive denominator:** Rounds up to the nearest integer.
* **Negative numerator, positive denominator:** Rounds "up" towards positive infinity (becomes a smaller negative integer or zero).
* **Positive numerator, negative denominator:** Rounds "up" towards positive infinity (becomes a smaller negative integer or zero).
* **Negative numerator, negative denominator:**  Rounds up to the nearest integer.


This improved code addresses the original issue and provides a more robust and understandable solution for rounding up integer division results in Java.
