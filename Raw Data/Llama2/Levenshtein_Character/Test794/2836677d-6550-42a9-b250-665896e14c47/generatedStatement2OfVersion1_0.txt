Key improvements:

* **Direct use of `Integer.toHexString()`:** This is the most straightforward and efficient way to convert a decimal to hexadecimal in Java.
* **Clear output:**  The output now clearly labels the result.
* **Additional examples:** The code now includes a couple of other examples to show how `Integer.toHexString()` handles different decimal values.
* **Input Handling (with error management):** The code now shows how to take a decimal number as input from the command line arguments (using `args`). It also includes a `try-catch` block to gracefully handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters something that isn't an integer.  This demonstrates more robust code.



How to compile and run (from the command line):

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DecimalToHexadecimal.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile: `javac DecimalToHexadecimal.java`
3. **Run:**  `java DecimalToHexadecimal`  (This will use the default value of 15)
4. **Run with input:** `java DecimalToHexadecimal 255` (This will convert 255 to hexadecimal)


This revised answer provides a more complete and practical solution for converting decimal to hexadecimal in Java, directly within the `main` method, while addressing input and error handling.
