Key Improvements and Explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly adheres to the specified method signatures: `public static void main(String[] args)` and `private static int[] Saddleback(int[][], int, int, int)`.

2. **Return an `int[]`:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` to store the row and column index of the target.  This is more informative than just printing the result inside the `Saddleback` method itself.  If the target isn't found, the method returns `{-1, -1}`.

3. **Handles Target Not Found:** The `main` method now correctly checks the return value from `Saddleback` to determine if the target was actually found and prints an appropriate message.

4. **Improved Comments:** Added more explanatory comments to enhance code readability.

5. **Example with Target Not Found:**  Includes a second search in `main` with a target value that is *not* in the array to demonstrate how the code handles this case.


How Saddleback Search Works:

Saddleback search is efficient for sorted 2D arrays. It starts at the top-right corner.  If the current element is smaller than the target, it moves down (to a row with potentially larger elements). If the current element is larger than the target, it moves left (to a column with potentially smaller elements). This process continues until the target is found or the boundaries of the array are reached.  The algorithm's efficiency stems from eliminating a row or column in each comparison.
