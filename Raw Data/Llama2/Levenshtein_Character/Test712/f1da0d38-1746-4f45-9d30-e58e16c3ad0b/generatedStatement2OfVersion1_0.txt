Explanation:

1. **`main` method:**
   - Initializes a sample 2D array `arr` (sorted row-wise and column-wise).
   - Sets `m` and `n` to the dimensions of the array.
   - Calls `Saddleback` with the array, dimensions, and target value.
   - Prints the result based on what `Saddleback` returns.

2. **`Saddleback` method:**
   - Initializes `row` to 0 (top row) and `col` to `n-1` (rightmost column).
   - Enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `row` is within the array bounds and `col` is a valid column index.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `arr[row][col]` equals the `target`, the target is found, and its row and column indices are returned in an `int[]`.
     - If `arr[row][col]` is less than the `target`, the target must be in a lower row (because rows are sorted), so `row` is incremented.
     - If `arr[row][col]` is greater than the `target`, the target must be in a column to the left (because columns are sorted), so `col` is decremented.
   - If the loop completes without finding the target, it means the target is not present in the array, so `{-1, -1}` is returned to indicate this.


Key Improvements:

- **Clearer variable names:** `m` and `n` are now used for rows and columns, making the code more readable.
- **Returns an `int[]`:** This allows returning both row and column indices cleanly, instead of relying on printing from within `Saddleback`.
- **Handles target not found:** The `{-1, -1}` return value provides a way for the `main` method to know if the target was not found.
- **Example usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` method and handle both cases (target found and not found).
- **Comments:**  Added more comments to explain the logic.
