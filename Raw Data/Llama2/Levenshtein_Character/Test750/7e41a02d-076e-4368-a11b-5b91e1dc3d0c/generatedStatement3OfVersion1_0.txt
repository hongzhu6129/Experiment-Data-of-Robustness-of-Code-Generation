**Key Improvements in the Testing Approach:**

* **Format Validation:** Tests the core functionality�formatting the date and time according to the specified pattern.
* **Handles Invalid Formats:** Demonstrates how to handle cases where the date-time string isn't in the expected format using `DateTimeParseException`.
* **Testability with Overriding (for demonstration):**  Shows how to override `getCurrentTime()` in the test to provide a fixed time for predictable output. This addresses the challenge of the system clock changing during the test.  A more robust solution would involve injecting a clock dependency, but that's a more advanced topic.
* **Corner Case Example (DST):** Comments out a DST test to illustrate a more advanced scenario and point towards the direction of a better solution involving `ZonedDateTime`.




This testing approach is much more robust and targets specific aspects of the `SystemTime` class that can be verified without being dependent on the constantly changing system clock. Remember, thorough testing is crucial, especially when dealing with date and time operations, which can have many subtle edge cases.
