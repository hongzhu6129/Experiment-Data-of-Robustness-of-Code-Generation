**Explanation and Key Concepts**

1. **Node Structure:** The `ListNode` class represents a single node in the linked list, containing an integer value (`val`) and a pointer to the next node (`next`).

2. **deleteNode() Method:** This is the core logic. It takes the node to be deleted as input. It handles the scenario where someone tries to delete the tail with this method, in which case it throws a clear error message.

   - It copies the `val` and `next` of the *next* node into the current node. This effectively overwrites the current node's data with the next node's data and removes the next node from the chain.
   - This approach is efficient because it doesn't require traversing the list from the head to find the previous node.  However, as mentioned, special handling for the tail is needed.

3. **printList() Method:** A utility function to print the linked list for demonstration purposes.

4. **main() Method:** The `main` method sets up an example linked list, demonstrates how to call `deleteNode()`, and prints the list before and after deletion. It also shows examples for edge cases and clear explanations.


**Important Considerations**

* **Tail Node:** As highlighted, this `deleteNode()` implementation *cannot* directly delete the tail node of the linked list. To delete the tail, you *must* traverse the list and modify the `next` pointer of the second-to-last node.  The example code now demonstrates how to do that.
* **Error Handling:** The updated code includes better handling for the tail node scenario, throwing a more descriptive exception to help the learner understand the limitation.
* **Educational Value:** The added comments, examples, and explanation significantly enhance the code's educational value, making it clear how the algorithm works and its limitations.



This improved version provides a more robust and educational solution for deleting a node from a singly linked list.
