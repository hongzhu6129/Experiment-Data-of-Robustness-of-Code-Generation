Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:** Includes explicit checks for empty and single-element arrays to avoid potential issues.
* **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueCount` is more descriptive than `j`.
* **In-place modification:** Modifies the input array directly, as requested.
* **Improved comments:**  More explanatory comments to clarify the logic.
* **Example usage in `main`:** Demonstrates how to use the function and prints the updated array (using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to show only the relevant part) for better visualization.
