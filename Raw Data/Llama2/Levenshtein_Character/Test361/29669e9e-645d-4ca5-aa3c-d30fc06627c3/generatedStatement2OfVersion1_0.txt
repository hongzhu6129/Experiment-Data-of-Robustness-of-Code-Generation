Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Interval Class:** The `Interval` class is well-defined with a constructor, `getStart()`, and `getEnd()` methods.
* **Conciseness:**  The code is more focused on the core logic.
* **Correctness:** Handles edge cases (empty or single-interval input) and merging logic is accurate.
* **Comparator for Sorting:** Uses a `Comparator` with `compare()` for clean sorting of intervals.  This makes the merge logic much simpler.
* **toString() override:** Makes printing the results easier.




This revised version adheres to the prompt's method signature restrictions and provides a robust solution to the merging intervals problem.
