This code demonstrates how to retrieve and print both environment variables and system properties within a single `main` method:

1. **Environment Variables:**  `System.getenv()` returns a `Map` where keys are environment variable names (like `PATH` or `JAVA_HOME`) and values are their corresponding values. The code iterates through this map and prints each key-value pair.


2. **System Properties:** `System.getProperties()` gets all system properties (things like the Java version, operating system, etc.). The `.list(System.out)` method directly prints these properties to the standard output stream, making it a concise way to display them. 


To run this code:

1. Save it as a `.java` file (e.g., `SystemInfo.java`).
2. Compile it using a Java compiler: `javac SystemInfo.java`
3. Run the compiled class: `java SystemInfo`


You'll see a list of your system's environment variables and properties printed to the console.
