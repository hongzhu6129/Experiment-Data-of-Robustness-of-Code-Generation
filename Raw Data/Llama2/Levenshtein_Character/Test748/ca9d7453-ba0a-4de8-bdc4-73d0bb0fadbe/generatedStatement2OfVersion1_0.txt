Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is now better formatted and commented.  Variable names are more descriptive (e.g., `a3` instead of `a*a*a`).
2. **Optimizations:** Several `break` statements are added to exit loops early when further calculations are unnecessary. This significantly improves performance.  We stop iterating once `a^3`, `b^3` or `sum` exceed `n`.
3. **Correctness:**  The inner loops now correctly start from `c + 1` and  `a + 1`, to avoid duplicate pairs (e.g. 1^3 + 12^3  and 12^3 + 1^3) being counted as distinct.
4. **Output format:** The code now prints the number and all the pairs of cubes that sum to it in a user-friendly way.
5. **Flexibility:** You can easily modify `n` to search up to a different limit.


This improved version is more efficient, easier to understand, and produces the desired output.
