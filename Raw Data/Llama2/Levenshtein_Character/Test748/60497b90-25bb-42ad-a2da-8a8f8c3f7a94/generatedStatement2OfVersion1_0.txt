**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Efficiency:** The code incorporates optimizations to stop inner loops early when the sums exceed `n`. This greatly reduces unnecessary calculations.

2. **Avoiding Duplicates:** The condition `b = a + 1` and `d = c + 1` in the inner loops avoids duplicate pairs (e.g., 1^3 + 2^3 and 2^3 + 1^3 are considered the same).

3. **Clarity:** The code is well-commented and uses meaningful variable names.

4. **Correctness:** It directly addresses the problem statement by finding a number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two *different* ways. The code exits as soon as the first such number is found.


**How it works:**

The code systematically checks all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to find a number `n` where `a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3` and `(a,b)` is not the same as `(c,d)`. The optimizations ensure that the code runs efficiently, especially for larger values of `n`.


**Running the code:**

If you run this code with `n = 1729`, it will output:
