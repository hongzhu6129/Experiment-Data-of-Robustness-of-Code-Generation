Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Efficiency:**  Added optimization checks (`if (a3 > n) break;` and `if (sum > n) break;`) to avoid unnecessary calculations when the sum exceeds `n`.
2. **Duplicate Prevention:**  Starts `b` from `a + 1` and ensures `c` is less than `b` to prevent duplicate pairs (e.g., (1, 12) and (12, 1)).
3. **Correctness:** Uses `Math.round(Math.pow(d3, 1.0 / 3.0))` and then checks if `d * d * d == d3` to ensure we're dealing with perfect integer cubes for `d`, handling potential floating-point inaccuracies.
4. **Distinct Pair Check:**  Includes `c != a && c != b && d != a && d != b` to strictly enforce that (c,d) is a *different* pair than (a,b).  This avoids cases where c or d might coincidentally equal a or b, giving a false "Ramanujan number".
5. **Clear Output:** Prints the result in the specified format: `sum = a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3`.
6. **Early Exit:** `return;` after finding the first Ramanujan number as requested.



This revised code correctly identifies 1729 as the first Ramanujan number and avoids reporting false positives. You can increase `n` to find larger Ramanujan numbers.
