Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Efficiency Optimizations:**  Several `break` statements are added inside the loops to stop unnecessary calculations when the sum of cubes exceeds `n` or `sum`. This significantly improves performance.

2. **Avoiding Duplicates:** The inner loop for `b` starts from `a + 1`. This prevents counting the same pair of cubes twice (e.g., 1� + 2� and 2� + 1�).

3. **Clarity and Readability:** The code is formatted consistently and uses meaningful variable names. Comments explain the logic.

4. **Correctness:** The condition `(a != c || b != d)` ensures that the two pairs of cubes (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct, fulfilling the requirement of "two (or more) different ways."

5. **Exit after Finding the First Such Number:** The `return;` statement exits the `main` method immediately after finding and printing the first Ramanujan number within the specified range.  If you want to find *all* such numbers within the range, you would remove the `return;` and let the loops complete.



How to Compile and Run:

1. Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. Compile: `javac Ramanujan.java`
3. Run:  `java Ramanujan`


This improved version will find Ramanujan numbers efficiently and correctly.  You can adjust the value of `n` to search within a different range.
