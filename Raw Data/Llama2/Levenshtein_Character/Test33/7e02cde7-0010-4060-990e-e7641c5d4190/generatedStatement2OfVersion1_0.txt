Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles `null` and empty arrays, returning 0 in these cases.
2. **Clearer Variable Names:** `k` is used to track the index of the next unique element, making the logic easier to follow.
3. **Concise Logic:** The core logic of removing duplicates is streamlined using a single `for` loop and `k` to efficiently manage the unique elements.
4. **Informative Output:**  The `main` method now demonstrates usage with multiple examples, including edge cases, and prints the resulting array length (`k`) and the modified array (using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid printing the unmodified portion of the array).
5. **No External Libraries:** The code utilizes only core Java libraries, specifically `java.util.Arrays` for printing the array. This keeps dependencies minimal.




This improved version addresses the potential issues and offers a more robust and clear solution for removing duplicates from a sorted array. It adheres to the requested method signatures and follows best practices.
