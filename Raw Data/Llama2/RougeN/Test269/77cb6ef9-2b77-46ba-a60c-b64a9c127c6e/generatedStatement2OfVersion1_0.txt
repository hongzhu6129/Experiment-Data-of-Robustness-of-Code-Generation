**Explanation and Example:**

1. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - This is the entry point of the program.  It calls `permutationWithRepeation` with the input string.

2. **`permutationWithRepeation(String str)`:**
   - This method initiates the recursive process by calling `showPermutation` with the original string and an empty prefix.

3. **`showPermutation(String str, String prefix)`:**
   - This is the recursive method that generates the permutations.
   - **Base Case:**  If the `prefix` has reached the length of the original `str`, it means a complete permutation has been formed. It prints the `prefix` and returns.
   - **Recursive Step:** It iterates through each character of the original `str`.  In each iteration, it adds the current character to the `prefix` and recursively calls `showPermutation` with the updated `prefix`.  This allows for characters to be repeated.

**Example with "abc":**

- Initial call: `showPermutation("abc", "")`
- First loop (i=0): `showPermutation("abc", "a")`
  - Second loop (i=0): `showPermutation("abc", "aa")`
    - Third loop (i=0): `showPermutation("abc", "aaa")` - Prints "aaa"
    - Third loop (i=1): `showPermutation("abc", "aab")` - Prints "aab"
    - Third loop (i=2): `showPermutation("abc", "aac")` - Prints "aac"
  - Second loop (i=1): `showPermutation("abc", "ab")`
    ... (and so on, following the pattern)



This will generate all 3^3 = 27 permutations with repetition, including "aaa", "aab", "aac", "aba", "abb", "abc", ..., "ccc".
