**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **TekelecComparator Class:** The core of the Tekelec sorting logic is encapsulated within a custom `Comparator` called `TekelecComparator`.  This makes the code more organized and reusable.

2. **TreeMap Initialization:** The `TreeMap` is initialized with an instance of the `TekelecComparator`. This ensures that the keys are sorted according to the Tekelec rules as soon as they are inserted.

3. **compare() Method:**  The `compare()` method implements the following logic:
   - It first compares the lengths of the two strings (`s1` and `s2`).
   - If the lengths are different, it returns the difference (`len1 - len2`). This ensures that shorter strings are considered "less than" longer strings.
   - If the lengths are the same, it uses the standard `String.compareTo()` method to sort alphabetically.


4. **Clearer Example Data:** I've added a couple of longer strings to the sample data to better demonstrate how the Tekelec sorting handles strings of varying lengths.


**How to Run:**

1. Save the code as `TekelecSort.java`.
2. Compile: `javac TekelecSort.java`
3. Run: `java TekelecSort`


The output will show the `TreeMap` entries sorted according to the Tekelec rules (shorter strings first, then alphabetically within each length group).
