Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes `try-catch` blocks to handle `DateTimeParseException` which can occur if the input string is not in the expected format. This makes the code more robust.
* **More Flexible Parsing:**  It first tries to parse using the standard ISO-8601 format. If that fails, it attempts parsing with a more specific format (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss).  You can easily adapt the patterns to match your input strings.
* **Clearer Demonstration:**  The `main` method shows examples of converting to and from strings, as well as getting previous time and formatting it.
* **Helper Methods:** The `stringToLocalDateTime` and `localDateTimeToString` methods encapsulate the conversion logic, making the code more organized and reusable.
* **Comments and Explanations:**  More comments have been added to explain the code's functionality and the different formatting options.


To use it:

1. **Compile:** Save the code as `StringTimeConverter.java` and compile it: `javac StringTimeConverter.java`
2. **Run:** `java StringTimeConverter`


You can modify the `timeString` variable in the `main` method to test with different date/time strings and formats. Be sure to adjust the format string in `DateTimeFormatter` if your input string does not follow the ISO-8601 or yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss format.
