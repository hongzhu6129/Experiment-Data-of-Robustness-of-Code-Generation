Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Handles Edge Cases:**  It correctly deals with situations where:
    * The string is empty or null.
    * The number of parts requested (`n`) is greater than the string length.
    * The last part might be shorter due to integer division.
* **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly labels the string and the number of parts for each example, making it easier to understand the results.
* **More Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes more test cases to demonstrate the handling of various scenarios, including empty and null strings.
* **Correct Remainder Distribution:**  The remainder characters are now correctly distributed among the initial parts of the string, ensuring a more even split.
* **Simplified Logic:**  The logic within the `splitString` method is more concise and easier to follow.
