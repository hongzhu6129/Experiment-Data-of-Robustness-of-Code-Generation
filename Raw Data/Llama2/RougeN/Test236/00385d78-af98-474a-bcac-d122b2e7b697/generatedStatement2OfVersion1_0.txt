Key improvements in this version:

* **Input Validation:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle `DateTimeParseException`. This prevents the program from crashing if the user enters an invalid date format.  It provides a helpful error message.
* **Clear Prompts:**  The prompts to the user are more explicit about the expected date format.
* **Direct Period Calculation:** Uses `Period.between()` which directly gives years and months, making the code cleaner and more efficient. There's no need for manual calculations or date manipulation.
* **Standard Library:** Leverages `java.time` (introduced in Java 8) for date/time handling. This is the modern and preferred way to work with dates and times in Java.  Avoid older classes like `Date` and `Calendar`.
