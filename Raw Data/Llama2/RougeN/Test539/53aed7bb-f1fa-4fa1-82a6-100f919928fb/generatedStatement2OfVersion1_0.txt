Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  Includes checks for `null` and empty input arrays.
- **Clearer variable names:**  `uniqueIndex` makes the purpose of the variable more evident.
- **In-place modification:**  Modifies the original array directly as requested, which is generally more efficient than creating a new array.
- **Comprehensive testing in `main`:** Demonstrates the function's behavior with various input scenarios, including empty and `null` inputs.
- **Output formatting:**  The `main` method uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`  and `Arrays.toString` to clearly display the updated portion of the array after duplicate removal, making the output much easier to understand.
