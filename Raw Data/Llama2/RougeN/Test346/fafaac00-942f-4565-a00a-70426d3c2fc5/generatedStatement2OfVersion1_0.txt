**Explanation and How to Run:**

1. **Input:** The program takes the number as a command-line argument.  This means you provide the number when you run the program from your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Error Handling:** The code includes a `try-catch` block.  This is essential for robust code.  It attempts to convert the input string (from `args[0]`) to an integer. If the user enters something that's not a number (like "abc"), the `NumberFormatException` is caught, and an error message is printed.

3. **Multiplication Table Logic:** The `for` loop iterates from 1 to 10. Inside the loop:
   - It calculates the product of the input number (`num`) and the loop counter (`i`).
   - It prints the multiplication table entry in the desired format (e.g., "8 x 1 = 8").

**To compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `MultiplicationTable.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:
