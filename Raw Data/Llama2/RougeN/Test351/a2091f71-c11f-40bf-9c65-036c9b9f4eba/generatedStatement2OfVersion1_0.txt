Key improvements and explanations:

* **Multiple Methods:**  Demonstrates several ways to copy an ArrayList: constructor, `addAll()`, `Collections.copy()`, and Java 8 Streams.
* **`Collections.copy()` Explanation:** Clarifies the crucial requirement that the destination list must be pre-sized before using `Collections.copy()`.  This prevents `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The code now includes `ensureCapacity()` and a loop to pre-fill the destination list.
* **Shallow Copy Warning:** Added a critical section showing how copying mutable objects (like `StringBuilder`) creates a *shallow* copy.  The new lists and the original list will reference the *same* objects, so modifying an object in one list affects all the others.
* **Stream API (Java 8+):** Included a method demonstrating copying using the Stream API's `collect()` method.
* **Clearer Comments:** Improved comments throughout to explain each approach and potential pitfalls.
* **Type Safety:** Uses generics `<String>` for better type safety.


This improved answer provides a more comprehensive understanding of ArrayList copying in Java, including crucial details about shallow copying and how to avoid common errors.
