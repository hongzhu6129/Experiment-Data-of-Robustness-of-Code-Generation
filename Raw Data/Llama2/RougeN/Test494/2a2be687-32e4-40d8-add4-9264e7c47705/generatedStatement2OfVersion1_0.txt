**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling (try-catch):**  The code now includes `try-catch` blocks. This is crucial when parsing strings, as a `NumberFormatException` will be thrown if the string cannot be converted to the desired numeric type (e.g., if it contains letters). The `try-catch` prevents the program from crashing and provides a way to handle the error gracefully.

2. **Clearer Output:** The output messages are more informative, indicating which conversion is being performed.

3. **Example of Robust Error Handling:**  The additional example with `invalidNumStr` demonstrates how to handle specific errors and provide more context in the error message, making debugging easier.

4. **Comments:** Comments explain the purpose of each section of the code.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.java` file (e.g., `StringConversions.java`).
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using the Java compiler:
