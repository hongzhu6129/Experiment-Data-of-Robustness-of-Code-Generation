Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes `try-catch` blocks to handle `NumberFormatException`. This is crucial because `parseInt`, `parseLong`, `parseFloat`, and `parseDouble` will throw this exception if the input string cannot be parsed into the desired numeric type. The error handling makes the program more robust.

2. **Clearer Output:** The `println` statements now clearly label each conversion (e.g., "String to int:", "String to long:").  This makes the output much easier to understand.

3. **Double Conversion (straight):** I've added the conversion to `double` using `Double.parseDouble()`. I assume "straight" in the prompt referred to the double data type, as it's the most common "straightforward" floating-point type.

4. **Example of Invalid Input:** An example demonstrating what happens when you try to convert an invalid string (like "abc") is included to highlight the importance of the `try-catch` block.

5. **Comments:** Added comments to explain each step of the code.


This improved version is more robust, informative, and demonstrates good coding practices by handling potential errors.
