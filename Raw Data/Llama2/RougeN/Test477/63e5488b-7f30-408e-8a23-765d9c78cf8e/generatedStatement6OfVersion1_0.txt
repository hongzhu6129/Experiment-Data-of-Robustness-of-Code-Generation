**Key improvements in this version:**

* **Error Handling:**  The code now includes error handling to deal with invalid input (non-integer or non-positive values for `n`).  This makes the program more robust.
* **Clearer Output:** The `\t` (tab) character is used to ensure better formatting of the matrix output.
* **Command-line Input:** The matrix size `n` is now taken as a command-line argument, making it more flexible and user-friendly.
* **Adherence to Method Signatures:** The code strictly follows the given method signature requirements (`main` and `printMatrix`).


**Example Output (for n=3):**
