Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

1. **Clearer Explanation of Capacity:** The code now clearly explains that there's no standard, reliable way in Java to directly get the capacity of an `ArrayList` *after* `trimToSize()` is called.  Reflection could potentially work (depending on the JVM), but it's not portable or guaranteed.

2. **Focus on Size and Memory:** The explanation emphasizes that `trimToSize()` is about reducing memory usage by eliminating unused allocated capacity. The list can still grow beyond the trimmed size if needed.

3. **Demonstration of Continued Growth:** The code adds more elements after `trimToSize()` to show that the list remains functional and can expand.

4. **Simplified Output:** The output focuses on the size, which we *can* measure, and clarifies the capacity situation.

5. **Correct Initial Size Reporting:**  The initial output now correctly reports the size, not the capacity (which we cannot reliably get directly).


This improved version provides a much more accurate and practical understanding of `trimToSize()` in Java. It sets correct expectations about what you can and cannot check after trimming.
