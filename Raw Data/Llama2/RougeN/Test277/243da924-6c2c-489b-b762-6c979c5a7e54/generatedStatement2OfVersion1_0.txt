Here's how this code works:

1. **Import necessary classes:**  We import `LocalDateTime`, `DateTimeFormatter`, `ChronoUnit`, and `Scanner`.
2. **Get user input:** We use a `Scanner` to prompt the user to enter the number of hours and minutes.
3. **Get current date and time:**  `LocalDateTime.now()` gets the current date and time.
4. **Calculate past date and time:** `minus(hours, ChronoUnit.HOURS)` and `minus(minutes, ChronoUnit.MINUTES)` subtract the specified hours and minutes from the current date and time.
5. **Format the date and time:** `DateTimeFormatter` is used to format the date and time into a readable string (e.g., "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss").
6. **Print the results:** We display both the current date and time and the calculated past date and time.
7. **Close the scanner:**  It's good practice to close the `Scanner` when you're done with it to release resources.


**Example Usage:**

If the user enters `2` for hours and `15` for minutes, and the current date and time is 2024-07-27 15:00:00, the output would be:
