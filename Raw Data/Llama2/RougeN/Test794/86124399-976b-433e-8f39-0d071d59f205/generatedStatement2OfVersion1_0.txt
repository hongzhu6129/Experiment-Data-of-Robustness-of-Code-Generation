Explanation and Improvements:

1. Handling Empty/Null Input:  The `streamAvg` method now explicitly handles cases where the input array is `null` or empty, preventing potential `NullPointerException` or `ArithmeticException`.  It prints a clear message indicating no numbers were provided.
2. Iterative Calculation with `getAvg`: The `streamAvg` method iterates through the `numbers` array. In each iteration, it calls `getAvg` to update the running average.
3. `getAvg` Logic: The `getAvg` method now implements an iterative calculation. Critically, it correctly handles integer division issues that could arise in intermediate calculations.
4. Clear Output: The `streamAvg` method now prints a user-friendly message indicating the calculated average. 


This revised version addresses the edge cases, provides more accurate calculations, and generates clearer output, making it a more robust and informative solution.
