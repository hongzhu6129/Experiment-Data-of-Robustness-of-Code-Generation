**Test Cases:**

1. **Valid Binary Input:**
   - Input: `1101`
   - Expected Output: `'d'`
   - Input: `101010`
   - Expected Output: `'2a'`
   - Input: `11111111`
   - Expected Output: `'ff'`

2. **Invalid Binary Input:**
   - Input: `10201` (Contains '2')
   - Expected Output: `Invalid binary input.`
   - Input: `111a11` (Contains 'a')
   - Expected Output: `Invalid binary input.`
   - Input: `abc`  (Completely invalid)
   - Expected Output: `Invalid binary input.`

3. **Boundary Cases:**
   - Input: `0`
   - Expected Output: `'0'` (Handles zero correctly)
   - Input: `1`
   - Expected Output: `'1'`
   - Input: (Empty string) 
   - Expected Output: *Program should ideally not crash but an empty string is not technically invalid binary so handling may vary.*  (The provided code treats this as 0 which is a reasonable interpretation).

4. **Large Binary Input:**
   - Input: `1111111111111111` (16 ones)
   - Expected Output: `'ffff'`
   - Input: A very long string of 1s and 0s. This tests for potential integer overflow if the decimal conversion isn't handled carefully.  The code provided uses `int` which limits the size of the binary number you can input.



This enhanced code and the test cases cover a broader range of scenarios, including error handling and boundary conditions, making it a more robust solution.  It also avoids using any built-in conversion methods as requested.
