This revised version addresses the following:

* **Command-line arguments:**  It takes the file names as command-line arguments, making it more flexible.  The `if (args.length != 2)` check ensures correct usage.
* **Error handling:**  The `try-with-resources` block and the `catch` block handle potential `IOExceptions` gracefully.
* **Comparison logic:** It correctly compares line by line, handling cases where one file might be shorter. The `compareTo()` method is the standard way to compare strings lexicographically in Java.
* **Clarity:**  Comments and clearer variable names improve readability.


To compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CompareFilesLexicographically.java`
2. **Compile:** `javac CompareFilesLexicographically.java`
3. **Run:**  `java CompareFilesLexicographically file1.txt file2.txt`  (Replace `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` with the actual file paths).
