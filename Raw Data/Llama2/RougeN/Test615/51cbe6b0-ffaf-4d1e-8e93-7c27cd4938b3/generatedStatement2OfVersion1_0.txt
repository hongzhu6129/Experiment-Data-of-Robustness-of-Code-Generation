Key improvements:

* **Uses `ListIterator`:** This is the most efficient way to traverse a `LinkedList` for this purpose.  It avoids the overhead of repeatedly calling `get(index)`.
* **Clearer variable names:**  `firstOccurrence` and `lastOccurrence` are more descriptive.
* **Handles the case where the element is not found:**  The code now prints a message if the target element is not present.
* **Added a second example:** Demonstrates the behavior when the target element isn't in the list.
* **Comments:** The code is well-commented, explaining the logic.
* **Correctly resets:** When searching for a second element,  `firstOccurrence`, `lastOccurrence`, the iterator, and the index are all reset to their initial values to avoid incorrect results from the previous search.


This improved version provides a more robust and efficient solution to the problem within the constraints of using only the `main` method.
