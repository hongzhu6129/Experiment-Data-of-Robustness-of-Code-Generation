**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Explicit Type Casting:** Fermat numbers grow very quickly.  Even `long` (64-bit integer) can only hold the first five accurately.  The code includes an explicit cast to `long` to handle the initial smaller Fermat numbers correctly.  Beyond the fifth, they will overflow, resulting in incorrect values.

2. **BigInteger for Larger Numbers:** To handle Fermat numbers beyond the fifth (which exceed the capacity of `long`), you would need to use `BigInteger`:
