3. **Platform Independence (If applicable):** If you intend this code to run on different operating systems, test it on those platforms to ensure consistent output. Line separators might vary (`\n` vs. `\r\n`), so the test case above using `System.lineSeparator()` is important for cross-platform compatibility.

4. **Character Encoding:**  While less likely an issue in this simple case, with more complex output involving special characters, you might consider testing with different character encodings to ensure correct display.


Although the face printer is simple, these testing approaches demonstrate good practice, which is crucial for more complex programs.  The automated test example using JUnit and `ByteArrayOutputStream` shows how you'd start to incorporate more structured testing for even simple output.  This provides a regression safety net as your code evolves.
