   Here, you would test each emotion to ensure the correct face is printed.  This demonstrates how you could add more complex logic and then test the different branches.


While the initial `printFace()` is simple, these examples illustrate how testing approaches evolve as the complexity of the code increases.  For simple output to console, visual inspection is usually enough, but the concepts of redirection and integration testing are valuable for more complex systems.  The "Modification" example shows how easily the code could be extended, and how those extensions would necessitate more thorough testing.
