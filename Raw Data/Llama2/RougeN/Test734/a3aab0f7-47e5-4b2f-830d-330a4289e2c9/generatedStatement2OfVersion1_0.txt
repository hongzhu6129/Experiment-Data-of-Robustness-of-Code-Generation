Key improvements in this version:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:**  Correctly handles null or empty strings.  It also trims leading/trailing spaces before processing and from the final output to avoid extra spaces in the result.

2. **Uses `Collections.reverse()`:** More concise and potentially more efficient way to reverse the word order than a manual loop.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using more descriptive variable names like `reversedString` and `words`.

4. **`StringBuilder` for Efficiency:** Uses `StringBuilder` to build the reversed string, which is generally more efficient than string concatenation with `+`.

5. **Test Cases:** Includes several test cases in `main` to demonstrate functionality with different inputs.
6. **Splitting on Multiple Spaces:** Uses `\\s+` in the `split()` method to handle multiple spaces between words correctly.



This revised code provides a more robust and efficient solution to the problem.
