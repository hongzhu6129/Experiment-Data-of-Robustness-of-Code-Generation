**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Input Validation (Optional but Recommended):**  While not strictly required by the prompt, you should consider adding input validation to check for invalid year inputs (e.g., negative years or extremely large years).

2. **Year Order Handling:** The code now correctly handles the case where the user enters the years in reverse order. It swaps the values to ensure `year1` is always less than or equal to `year2`.

3. **Looping for Calculation:**  The core logic calculates the total days by iterating from `year1` (inclusive) up to `year2` (exclusive).  For each year, it calls `number_of_days` to determine the number of days in that year and adds it to the `totalDays`.

4. **Clearer Method Names:** The method names (`number_of_days` and `is_Leap_Year`) are more descriptive and follow Java naming conventions (camelCase).

5. **Scanner Resource Management:** The `scanner.close()` statement is added to release the `Scanner` resource after it's no longer needed.
