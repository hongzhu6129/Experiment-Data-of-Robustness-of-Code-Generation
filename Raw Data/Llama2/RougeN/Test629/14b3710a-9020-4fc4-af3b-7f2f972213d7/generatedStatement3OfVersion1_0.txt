**How Horner's Method Works (in the `polyEval` function):**

Let's trace the example -19 + 7x - 4x^2 + 6x^3  with x = 3:

1. **Initialization:** `result = 0.0`
2. **Loop 1 (i = 3):** `result = 0.0 * 3 + 6.0 = 6.0`
3. **Loop 2 (i = 2):** `result = 6.0 * 3 + (-4.0) = 18.0 - 4.0 = 14.0`
4. **Loop 3 (i = 1):** `result = 14.0 * 3 + 7.0 = 42.0 + 7.0 = 49.0`
5. **Loop 4 (i = 0):** `result = 49.0 * 3 + (-19.0) = 147.0 - 19.0 = 128.0`

The final result is 128.0, as expected. This demonstrates how Horner's method efficiently computes the polynomial value by accumulating the result from the innermost brackets outwards.
