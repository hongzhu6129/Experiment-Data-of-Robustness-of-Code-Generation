 Only use the method signatures public static void main(String[]), public static double polyEval(List<Double>, double) to generate code for the problem description: a fast scheme for evaluating a polynomial such as: -19+ 7x- 4x + 6x when x=3 is to prepared the computation as follows: ((((0)x+6)x+(-4))x+7)x+(-19) write a Java program to compute the result from the innermost brackets.
The programming language is Java.
