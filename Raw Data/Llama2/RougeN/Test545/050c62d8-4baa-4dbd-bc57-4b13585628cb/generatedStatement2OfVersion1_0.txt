Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Corrected Formula:** The formula now correctly alternates signs between terms (subtraction and addition) as specified in the Leibniz formula for pi.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `piApproximation1` and `piApproximation2` makes the purpose of each calculation more obvious.
* **Explicit Double Arithmetic:** The code explicitly uses `1.0`, `3.0`, etc., to ensure floating-point calculations are performed.  This avoids potential integer division issues.
* **Conciseness and Readability:**  The code is well-formatted and easy to follow.


This version accurately calculates the pi approximations using the given number of terms and clearly presents the results.
