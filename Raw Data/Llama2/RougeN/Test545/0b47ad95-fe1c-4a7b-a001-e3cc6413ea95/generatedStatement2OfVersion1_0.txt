Key improvements in this code:

* **Clarity and Correctness:**  The code now correctly calculates the approximations based on the provided formula and the clarified requirements in the prompt (5 terms, 6 terms, and the additional 7-term version).
* **Double Precision:** Using `1.0` and `3.0` etc., ensures that floating-point division is performed, giving a much more accurate approximation of pi.
* **Meaningful Output:** The output clearly labels each approximation, making it easy to understand the results.
* **Simplicity and Readability:** The code is straightforward and easy to follow.  The comments explain the purpose of each section.


This revised response directly addresses the prompt's requirements and provides a correct and well-explained solution for approximating pi using the given formula.
