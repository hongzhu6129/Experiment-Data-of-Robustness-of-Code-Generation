The original error "invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'euclidean'" likely arose because you were trying to convert the string "euclidean" into an integer, which is not possible.  The corrected code takes integer inputs directly from the user using `scanner.nextInt()`, avoiding this issue entirely.  It then calls the `euclid` method to calculate the GCD and prints the result.
