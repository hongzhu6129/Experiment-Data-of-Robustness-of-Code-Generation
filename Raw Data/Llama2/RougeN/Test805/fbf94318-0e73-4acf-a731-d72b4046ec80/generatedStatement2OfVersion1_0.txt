Key improvements in this revised code:

- **Clearer Comments:**  Added more explanatory comments to make the recursion logic easier to understand.
- **Test Cases:** Included multiple test cases (an empty tree, a skewed tree, and a more balanced tree) in `main` to demonstrate the correctness of the `maxDepth` method in various scenarios.
- **Node Class:** The `Node` class is now included within the same file for completeness and better organization.  You could move it to its own file if preferred.
- **Conciseness:**  The code is efficient and avoids unnecessary complexity.



This improved version provides a more robust and understandable solution to finding the maximum depth of a binary tree in Java.
