Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Clearer Prompts:** The code now provides clearer prompts to the user for input.

2. **Input Validation (Optional but Recommended):** While not strictly required by the prompt, it's good practice to add input validation to check if the user actually entered valid binary numbers (consisting of only 0s and 1s).  You could do this using a regular expression or by checking each character in the input strings.

3. **Direct Binary Multiplication (Alternative - Not using `binaryproduct` directly as decimal multiplication):** If you truly want to multiply the binary numbers *as binary*, you could implement a binary multiplication algorithm directly (using bitwise operations and shifts) within the `binaryproduct` method. However, the prompt seems to imply simply multiplying the decimal equivalent of the binary numbers.

Example of Binary Multiplication Algorithm (if needed):
