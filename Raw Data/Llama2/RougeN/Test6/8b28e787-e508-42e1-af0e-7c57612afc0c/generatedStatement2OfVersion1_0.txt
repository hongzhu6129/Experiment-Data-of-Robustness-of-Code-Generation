**Explanation and Test Cases:**

1. **The `swap` Method:** The core logic resides in the `swap` method. It uses a temporary variable (`temp`) to store the value of `a`, then performs a circular shift: `a` gets `b`'s value, `b` gets `c`'s value, and `c` gets the original value of `a` (stored in `temp`).

2. **Test Cases:** The `main` method now includes several test cases to ensure the `swap` method works correctly under various conditions:

   - **Positive Integers:** Standard case.
   - **Negative Integers:** Checks for correct handling of negative values.
   - **Zero Values:** Checks for behavior with zero values.
   - **Duplicate Values:** Ensures the swap works even if two or more variables have the same initial value.
   - **Large Numbers:** Tests with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` to handle potential overflow or underflow issues (though this specific swap algorithm doesn't cause those issues with integers).


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SwapThreeVariables.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac SwapThreeVariables.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code with: `java SwapThreeVariables`


The output will show the original and swapped values for each test case, confirming the correctness of the swapping logic.
