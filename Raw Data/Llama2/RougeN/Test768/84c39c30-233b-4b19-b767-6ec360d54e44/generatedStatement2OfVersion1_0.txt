**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Regular Expressions:** The code now uses regular expressions (`Pattern` and `Matcher`) to efficiently extract numbers from the string.  The pattern `\\d+` matches one or more consecutive digits. This handles cases where numbers have more than one digit and are interspersed with non-digit characters.

2. **Error Handling (Implicit):** `Integer.parseInt()` will throw a `NumberFormatException` if it encounters a non-numeric string.  However, because our regular expression *only* matches digits, this is very unlikely to happen, making explicit `try-catch` blocks unnecessary in this specific case.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** More descriptive variable names (e.g., `inputString`, `sum`) improve readability.

4. **Example Cases in `main()`:** The `main` method now demonstrates the code's behavior with several different input strings, including cases with multiple numbers, no numbers, and spaces between numbers.


**How it Works:**

* The `sumOfTheNumbers` method takes the input string.
* It creates a `Pattern` object representing the regular expression `\d+`.
* It creates a `Matcher` object to find matches of the pattern within the input string.
* The `while (matcher.find())` loop iterates through each match found.
* Inside the loop, `matcher.group()` retrieves the matched substring (the number), `Integer.parseInt()` converts it to an integer, and it's added to the `sum`.
* Finally, the method returns the total sum.
