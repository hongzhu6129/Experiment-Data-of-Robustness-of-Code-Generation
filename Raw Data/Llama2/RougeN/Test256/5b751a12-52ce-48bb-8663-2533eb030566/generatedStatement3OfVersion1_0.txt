This JUnit example demonstrates how to automate the testing process.  You would add similar `@Test` methods for each of your test cases.  The `assertEquals` method checks if the actual output of your `calculateAverage` function matches the expected output. The delta in the integer overflow test allows for a small margin of error in the calculation, due to potential rounding issues with very large numbers.



By thoroughly testing your code with various inputs, you can increase confidence in its correctness and handle potential edge cases.
