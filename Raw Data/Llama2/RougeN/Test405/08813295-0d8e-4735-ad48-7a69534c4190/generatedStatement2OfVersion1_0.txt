Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`isPerfectCube()` method:**  A separate method now handles the cube checking logic, making the code more organized and reusable.

2. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The `isPerfectCube()` method now correctly handles negative numbers by checking the absolute value and returning the result accordingly.

3. **Efficient Cube Root Check:** The code uses `Math.cbrt()` (cubic root) and `Math.round()` for a more efficient check.  This avoids the less efficient iterative approach, especially for larger numbers.

4. **Clearer Output Message:** The output message now matches the prompt's expected output: "Number same a cube."  (I've also added a "not a cube" message for completeness).

5. **Comments and Explanation:**  Added comments explaining the logic and the efficiency considerations.


This improved version is more robust, efficient, and adheres to good coding practices. It also addresses the specific requirements and output format of the original prompt more accurately.
