Key improvements and adherence to requirements:

1. **Method Signatures:** Uses only the specified method signatures: `main`, `merge`, `getStart`, `getEnd`, and `compare`.
2. **Interval Class:**  The `Interval` class now encapsulates the start and end values.
3. **Comparator:** Uses a `Comparator` with the `compare` method for sorting intervals based on start times.
4. **Clarity and Comments:** Improved code comments and variable names for better readability.
5. **Handles Edge Cases:** Correctly handles cases like an empty input list or a list with a single interval.
6. **Correct Merging Logic:**  Ensures intervals are merged accurately, even for consecutive overlaps (e.g., [1,3], [2,6], [5,8] would merge to [1,8]).
7. **Last Interval:** Adds the last processed `currentInterval` to the `mergedIntervals` list after the loop to avoid missing the final merged interval.
