Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Examples:**  Provides examples with both values present and absent in the map, making the demonstration more comprehensive.

2. **Two Methods Demonstrated:** Shows both `containsValue()` (the most efficient and direct way) and manual iteration (for educational purposes, to illustrate how you could search if `containsValue()` didn't exist).

3. **`break` Statement:** Added a `break` statement in the iteration loop.  Once the value is found, there's no need to continue iterating.  This is a good practice for efficiency.

4. **Important Note on `Double` and Floating-Point Comparisons:** Includes a crucial explanation and example regarding the potential pitfalls of using `containsValue()` with `Double` or other floating-point types.  Direct comparison can be unreliable due to how floating-point numbers are represented.  This is a common source of errors, so highlighting it is essential in an educational context.


This improved version offers a more complete and insightful learning experience about how to check for values in a Java Map.
