Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` input.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` more clearly reflects its purpose.
- **Improved comments:**  Explains the logic and purpose of the code better.
- **Comprehensive testing:** The `main` method includes test cases for various scenarios (empty array, null, single element, duplicates, etc.) to demonstrate correct functionality.
- **Output formatting:** Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` and `Arrays.toString` to neatly display the modified array up to the new length, avoiding printing the unchanged parts of the original array.


This revised code is robust, well-documented, and effectively demonstrates the solution to the problem.
