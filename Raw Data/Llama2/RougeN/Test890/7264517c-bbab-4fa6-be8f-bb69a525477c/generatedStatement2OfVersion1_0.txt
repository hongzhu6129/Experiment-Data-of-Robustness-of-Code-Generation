Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  The `sort()` method now correctly handles null and empty input arrays without throwing exceptions.
* **Clearer variable names:** Using `lowerIndex` and `higherIndex` instead of `i` and `j` in the `quickSort` signature improves readability.  (The `i` and `j` are still used *within* the `quickSort` method as they are commonly used for these roles in quicksort algorithms.)
* **More robust pivot selection:** The pivot is chosen as the middle element to avoid worst-case performance in already sorted or nearly sorted arrays.
* **Comprehensive testing:** The `main` method includes test cases with an empty array, a null array, and an already sorted array.
* **Output:** The code now prints the sorted array to the console.



This revised code addresses the potential issues and provides a more robust and complete quicksort implementation.
