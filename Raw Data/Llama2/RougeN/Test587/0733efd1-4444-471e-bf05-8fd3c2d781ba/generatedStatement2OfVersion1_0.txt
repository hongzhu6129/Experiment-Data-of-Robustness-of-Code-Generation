Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Different Data Types:** The custom `Comparator` now correctly compares and sorts `String` and `Number` objects within the list. It puts Strings before Numbers in the sorted order (you can change this logic if needed).

2. **More Robust Type Handling:** Uses `instanceof` and casting to safely handle different object types.

3. **Example with Custom Objects:**  Demonstrates how to sort a list of more complex objects (`SophisticatedObject`) based on multiple fields (name, then value). Uses Java 8's more concise `Comparator.comparing()` and `thenComparing()` for this.

4. **Clearer Comments and Explanation:** The code includes more comments to explain the logic and purpose of different parts.

5. **Error Handling (Optional):** You could enhance the Comparator with more advanced error handling to deal with unexpected object types (e.g., throw an exception if you only want to allow String and Number types in the list).
