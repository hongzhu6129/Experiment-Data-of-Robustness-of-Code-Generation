Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Use `TreeMap`:**  `TreeMap` in Java is implemented as a Red-Black tree, which maintains a sorted order of keys.  This allows us to efficiently find the least key greater than a given key.

2. **`higherKey()` method:** The `TreeMap` class provides the `higherKey(K key)` method, which directly returns the least key strictly greater than the given key.  If no such key exists, it returns `null`.

3. **Clearer output:**  The output now explicitly states when no greater key is found, making it easier to understand the results.

4. **String Key Example:** Included an example to show how `TreeMap` and `higherKey()` works with String keys, demonstrating its versatility.  Strings are compared lexicographically (alphabetical order).


5. **Comprehensive Examples:** Provides several example cases to illustrate how `higherKey()` behaves with different inputs and data types. This helps to fully understand the functionality.
