**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **ArrayList (Dynamic Sizing):** The preferred way is to use an `ArrayList`.  An `ArrayList` grows automatically as you add lines, so you don't need to know the number of lines in the file beforehand. This is more efficient and safer.

2. **`toArray()` for Conversion:**  After reading the lines into the `ArrayList`, you can easily convert it to a regular String array (`String[]`) using `linesList.toArray(new String[0]);`.

3. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that might occur during file reading. This makes the code more robust.

4. **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted using `Arrays.toString()` to display the array contents in a readable way.

5. **Commented-out Fixed Size Array Example:** The less flexible fixed-size array approach is included as a comment for demonstration but is not recommended.  It's shown to highlight the limitations and potential issues (like `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`) that can arise if you don't know the exact number of lines.

**How to Use:**

1. **Create a text file:** Create a file named `your_file.txt` (or whatever you choose) in the same directory as your Java code or provide the full path to the file.
2. **Add text:**  Put some text into the file, each line representing an element you want in the array.
3. **Compile and run:** Compile and run the Java code. The output will display the contents of the file stored in a String array.
