Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that might occur during image saving. This makes the code more robust.

2. **Clearer Output:**  Instead of just printing the result to the console, the program now explicitly states that the image has been saved and provides the filename.

3. **Image Creation and Manipulation:**
   - Uses `BufferedImage` to create an image in memory.
   - Uses `Graphics2D` to draw on the image.
   - Sets background color to white for better visibility.
   - Sets text color and font.
   - Calculates the position of the text using `FontMetrics` to center it on the image.

4. **Image Saving:** Uses `ImageIO.write()` to save the image as a PNG file.

5. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the purpose of different parts of the code.


To run this code:

1. Save it as `DivideAndPrint.java`.
2. Compile it: `javac DivideAndPrint.java`
3. Run it: `java DivideAndPrint`

This will create an image file named `division_result.png` in the same directory as the Java file.  The image will contain the text "50 / 3 = 16".


If you don't have external libraries for image processing (like those that come standard in most Java development environments), you may need to add those to your classpath or use a different method for image creation/saving.  The core logic for the division and the string formatting for the equation would remain the same.
