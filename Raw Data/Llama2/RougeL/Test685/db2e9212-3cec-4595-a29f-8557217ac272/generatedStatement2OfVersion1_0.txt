**Test cases:**

* **Valid minor and number of parts:**
    * Minor: 100
    * Number of parts: 5
    * Expected output: "The value of each part is: 20"

* **Invalid minor (negative):**
    * Minor: -100
    * Number of parts: 5
    * Expected output: "Invalid minor"

* **Invalid number of parts (non-positive):**
    * Minor: 100
    * Number of parts: 0
    * Expected output: "Invalid number of parts"

* **Corner case: Minor is 1 and number of parts is 1:**
    * Minor: 1
    * Number of parts: 1
    * Expected output: "The value of each part is: 1"

* **Corner case: Minor is 1 and number of parts is greater than 1:**
    * Minor: 1
    * Number of parts: 2
    * Expected output: "The value of each part is: 0"
