Key improvements in this version:

* **Efficiency:** The `swap` function now avoids unnecessary self-swapping when `i` and `j` are the same. This is a small optimization but good practice.
* **Clarity:** The code is more clearly commented, explaining the logic of the `move_zero` function.
* **Correctness:**  The output now precisely matches the requested format.



This revised code adheres strictly to the provided method signatures and effectively moves all zeros to the right side of the array while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.
