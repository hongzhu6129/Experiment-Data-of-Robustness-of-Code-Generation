Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Clearer Comments:** More comments explaining the logic step-by-step, making it suitable for educational purposes.
2. **Handles Edge Cases:**  Includes handling for empty (`{}`) and `null` input arrays, which is important for robust code.
3. **Illustrative Output:**  Prints the modified array (up to the new length) within the `removeDuplicates` function, making it easier to understand the changes. The `main` method also provides clear examples.
4. **Efficiency:** The code maintains the efficient in-place modification of the array (O(n) time complexity).
5. **Conciseness:**  The core logic remains concise and easy to follow.
