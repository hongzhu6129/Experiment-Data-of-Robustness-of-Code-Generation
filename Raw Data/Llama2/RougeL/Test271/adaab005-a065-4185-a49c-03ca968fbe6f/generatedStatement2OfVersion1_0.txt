Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Date/Time Handling:** Uses `LocalDate` for dates and `LocalDateTime` for date and time, providing more precise and flexible handling.
* **`java.time` Package:**  Leverages the modern `java.time` package (introduced in Java 8) for cleaner date/time operations.  Avoid older classes like `Date` and `Calendar`.
* **Formatting:** Uses `DateTimeFormatter` to format the output consistently.
* **Example Holidays:** Includes examples of fixed-date holidays (New Year's, Christmas) and a calculated holiday (Thanksgiving).
* **Thanksgiving Calculation:**  Provides a corrected and more robust method (`getThanksgivingDate()`) to calculate the date of Thanksgiving (the 4th Thursday of November).
* **Helper Function:**  Uses a `displayHolidayInfo()` function to avoid code duplication and make the `main` method more readable.
* **Comments:** Includes comments to explain the logic.
* **Error Handling (Thanksgiving Calculation):** Adds a check to handle the edge case where the first of November might fall on a day that could cause a negative `daysToAdd` value, leading to an incorrect result. The modulo operator (`%`) and the `if` condition ensure the calculation is correct.
