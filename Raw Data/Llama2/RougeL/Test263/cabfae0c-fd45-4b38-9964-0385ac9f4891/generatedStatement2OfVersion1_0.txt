**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Two-Pointer Approach:**  Uses `left` and `right` pointers to efficiently iterate from both ends of the array.

2. **Optimized Swapping:** Swaps elements only when a negative number is found on the left and a positive number is on the right.  This reduces unnecessary swaps.

3. **Handles Zeros Correctly:** Zeros are considered "positive" in this implementation (they are moved to the right).  If you need a different behavior for zeros, adjust the conditions in the `while` loops accordingly.

4. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code now gracefully handles empty arrays without throwing exceptions.

5. **Clearer Main Method:**  Includes more test cases (including zeros and an empty array) for better demonstration.  The output is also formatted for readability.



This improved version is more efficient, handles different scenarios correctly, and is easier to understand.
