Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Test Cases:**  The test cases are now more organized and cover a wider range of scenarios, including positive, negative, zero, and large values (to illustrate a potential overflow issue).
* **Comments:** Comments explain each test case and the logic behind the swapping method.
* **Overflow Consideration:** The code highlights the potential for integer overflow when using the addition/subtraction method with extremely large or small numbers. *Crucially*, a more robust solution using a temporary variable is also provided which avoids the overflow problem entirely.
* **Output Clarity:** The `println` statements are formatted to make the output easier to read and understand.


This revised answer provides a more complete and educational example of swapping variables in Java, including a discussion of important considerations like integer overflow.  It also demonstrates a safer, more generally applicable technique using a temporary variable.
