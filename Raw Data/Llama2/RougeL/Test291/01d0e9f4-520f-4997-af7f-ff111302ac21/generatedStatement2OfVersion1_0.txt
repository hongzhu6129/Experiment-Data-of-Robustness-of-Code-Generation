Key improvements and adherence to the prompt:

* **Strict adherence to method signatures:** The code uses *only* `main`, `merge`, `getStart`, `getEnd`, and `compare` (within the Comparator) as specified.
* **Clearer Interval class:** The `Interval` class is now more self-contained and readable.
* **Improved merging logic:** The merging logic is now more efficient and handles edge cases correctly.  It properly merges overlapping intervals even if multiple intervals overlap.
* **Example usage in main:**  Demonstrates how to use the `merge` function with sample data.
* **Comments and formatting:** The code is well-commented and formatted for better readability.


This revised version addresses all the previous shortcomings while strictly adhering to the given method signature constraints.  It effectively merges overlapping intervals and demonstrates its usage with a clear example.
