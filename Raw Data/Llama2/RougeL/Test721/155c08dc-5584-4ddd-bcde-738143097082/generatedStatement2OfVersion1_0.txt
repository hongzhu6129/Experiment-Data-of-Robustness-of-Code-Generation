**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Binary Literals:** The code now uses binary literals (e.g., `0b10`, `0b11`) directly.  This is much clearer than representing binary numbers as integers in base 10.

2. **Helper Functions:** The core logic of binary-to-decimal and decimal-to-binary conversion is now encapsulated in separate helper methods (`binaryToDecimal` and `decimalToBinary`).  This makes the code more modular, readable, and easier to maintain.

3. **Clearer Conversion Logic:** The conversion algorithms within the helper functions are more straightforward and efficient.

4. **Output in Binary:**  The output now correctly uses `Integer.toBinaryString(product)` to display the product in binary format.

**How it works:**

- The `main` method takes two binary numbers (represented using binary literals).
- It calls the `binaryproduct` method to calculate the product.
- `binaryproduct` converts the binary numbers to their decimal equivalents, performs the multiplication, and converts the decimal result back to binary.
- The final binary product is printed to the console.


This revised version is more efficient, readable, and correctly handles binary numbers as intended.
