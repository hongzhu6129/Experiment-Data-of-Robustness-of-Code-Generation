Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Callable Definitions:** Using lambda expressions for `Callable` tasks makes the code more concise and readable.
* **ExecutorService:**  Uses `ExecutorService` with a fixed thread pool for better management of threads. The number of threads in the pool can be adjusted (e.g., `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4)` for more tributaries if needed for a larger dataset).
* **Future.get():** Correctly retrieves the results from the `Future` objects using `get()`. This method blocks until the result is available.
* **Shutdown Executor:**  Includes `executor.shutdown()` to properly terminate the executor service after the tasks are completed. This prevents resource leaks.
* **Example Data:** Added some sample numbers to the `numbers` list for demonstration purposes.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the key parts of the code.


This revised version provides a more robust and efficient solution for calculating even and odd sums using tributaries (threads) in Java.
