Key improvements and explanations:

* **JUnit Tests:**  The code now includes JUnit 5 tests to verify the `calculatePerimeter` and `calculateArea` methods. This is crucial for ensuring the correctness of the code.  The test cases cover:
    * Positive radius
    * Zero radius
    * Very large radius (handling potential overflow).
    * Negative radius (expecting an `IllegalArgumentException` - this handling was added below)

* **Increased Precision:**  The `printf` format specifiers are now `%.12f` to display more decimal places, matching the desired output in the prompt.

* **Handling Negative Radius:** The code can be modified to handle negative radii gracefully by throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`, as negative radii are not physically meaningful.  The test cases reflect this expected behavior.

* **Clearer Output:**  The output now labels the radius, perimeter, and area clearly.

* **Testability:** Separating the calculation logic into methods (`calculatePerimeter`, `calculateArea`) makes the code much easier to test.


How to run the tests:

1. **IDE:** If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, it has built-in support for running JUnit tests.  Right-click on the test class and select "Run."

2. **Command Line:**  You can compile and run the tests from the command line:
