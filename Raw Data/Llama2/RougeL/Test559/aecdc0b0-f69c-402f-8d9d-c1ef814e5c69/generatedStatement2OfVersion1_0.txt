Key improvements and explanations:

1. **JUnit Tests:**  The code now includes JUnit tests, which are crucial for verifying the correctness of the `calculatePerimeter` and `calculateArea` methods.

2. **Corner Cases:** The tests cover important corner cases:
   - Zero radius:  A circle with radius 0 should have 0 perimeter and 0 area.
   - Very small radius:  Tests with a tiny radius (1E-10) are included to check for potential issues with very small numbers. The `delta` parameter in `assertEquals` is adjusted accordingly for these cases to handle potential floating-point inaccuracies.
   - Large radius:  A test with a large radius (1.5E7) is added to check for potential overflow problems (which could occur if `float` was used instead of `double`).

3. **Clearer Output:** The `main` method now uses `printf` to format the output to 12 decimal places for consistency with the expected values.

4. **Tolerance in Assertions:** The `assertEquals` method in JUnit now uses a third argument ( `delta` or tolerance) in some cases. This is important when comparing floating-point numbers because tiny rounding errors can occur.


How to Run the Tests:

If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you can typically right-click the test class (`CircleCalculationsTest`) and select "Run 'CircleCalculationsTest'".

If you're using the command line:
1. Compile: `javac CircleCalculations.java CircleCalculationsTest.java`
2. Run tests (assuming you have JUnit on your classpath): `java org.junit.platform.console.ConsoleLauncher --class-path . --scan-classpath`  (or use the appropriate command for your JUnit version)



This improved version provides much better confidence in the correctness of the circle calculations due to the comprehensive test coverage.
