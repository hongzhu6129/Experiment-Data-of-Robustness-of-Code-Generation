Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles cases where the input string is null or empty, and where there are fewer vowels than `n`. It returns an empty string in these cases.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `vowelsList` is renamed to simply `vowels` to be more concise.

3. **More Efficient Vowel Check:** Uses `indexOf` on the "aeiou" string for a more efficient vowel check compared to individual character comparisons.

4. **Case-Insensitivity:** Converts the input to lowercase before checking vowels, ensuring case-insensitive matching as requested in the prompt.

5. **StringBuilder for Efficiency:** Uses `StringBuilder` for building the result string, which is more efficient than repeated string concatenation using `+`.

6. **Correct Substring Extraction:**  Calculates the correct `startIndex` based on `n` and the number of vowels, then extracts the appropriate characters.  Handles cases where the number of vowels is less than n correctly.

7. **Comprehensive Examples:**  Includes several examples in `main` to demonstrate the function's behavior with various inputs, including edge cases.



This revised code addresses the previous issues and provides a more robust and efficient solution to the problem.
