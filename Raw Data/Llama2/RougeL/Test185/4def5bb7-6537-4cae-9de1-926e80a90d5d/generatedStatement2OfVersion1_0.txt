**Explanation and How it Implements Horner's Method:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The provided calculation ((((0)x+6)x+(-4))x+7)x+(-19) demonstrates Horner's method (also called Horner's rule or Horner's scheme). This method efficiently evaluates polynomials by minimizing the number of multiplications.

2. **`polyEval` Implementation:**  The `polyEval` method precisely implements Horner's method.
   - It initializes `result` to 0.
   - The loop iterates through the coefficients from the highest power of x to the constant term.
   - In each iteration:
     - `result` is multiplied by `x`.
     - The current coefficient is added to `result`.

3. **Example Breakdown (Using x=3 and the provided polynomial):**
   - **Iteration 1:** `result = (0 * 3) + 6 = 6`
   - **Iteration 2:** `result = (6 * 3) + (-4) = 18 - 4 = 14`
   - **Iteration 3:** `result = (14 * 3) + 7 = 42 + 7 = 49`
   - **Iteration 4:** `result = (49 * 3) + (-19) = 147 - 19 = 128`

Therefore, the final result is 128, as you would expect when evaluating -19 + 7x - 4x^2 + 6x^3 with x = 3.


**Key Advantages of Horner's Method:**

* **Efficiency:**  Reduces the number of multiplications compared to a naive approach.
* **Numerical Stability:**  Can be more stable when dealing with floating-point numbers.


This improved code directly implements Horner's method and provides clear comments to explain the process.  The example in `main` demonstrates its usage with the given polynomial and x value.
