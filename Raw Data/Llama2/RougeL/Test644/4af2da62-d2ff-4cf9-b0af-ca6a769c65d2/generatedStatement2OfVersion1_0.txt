Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Empty Array:** Added a check at the beginning of `exponentialSearch` to handle the case of an empty input array. This prevents potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. **Handles First Element:**  Added a check to see if the first element itself is the target. This improves efficiency in that specific case.

3. **Clearer Binary Search Range:** The `binarySearch` now receives clearer `low` and `high` bounds, using `Math.min(i, n-1)` to ensure the `high` index doesn't go out of bounds.

4. **Adherence to Method Signature:** The code strictly uses the provided `main` and `exponentialSearch` method signatures. The `binarySearch` is made `private` as it's a helper function.

5. **Comprehensive Testing in `main`:**  The `main` method now includes test cases for an element present, an element not present, and an empty array to demonstrate the robustness of the code.


This improved version is more robust, handles edge cases correctly, and clearly demonstrates the Exponential Search algorithm within the constraints of the specified method signatures.
