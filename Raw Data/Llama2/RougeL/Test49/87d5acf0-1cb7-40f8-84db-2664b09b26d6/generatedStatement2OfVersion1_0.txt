Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Clarity and Comments:** Added comprehensive comments to explain the purpose of the code, the algorithm used, and the handling of edge cases like negative numbers (which may or may not be considered narcissistic depending on the exact definition).

2. **Efficiency:** The `is_narc_dec_num` method was optimized by converting the number to a string only once.  This is slightly more efficient than repeatedly converting individual digits within the loop.

3. **Negative Number Handling:** The code explicitly handles negative numbers by returning `false`.  You can adjust this if your definition of narcissistic numbers includes negatives.

4. **String Conversion:** Used `String.valueOf()` for converting the number to a string, which is generally preferred over concatenation with an empty string ("" + num).


How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Solution.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using the command:  `javac Solution.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with: `java Solution`


This will print the first 15 narcissistic decimal numbers to the console.
