## Test Cases

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

**1. Basic Cases:**

* **Input Range:** 1 to 100 (as specified)
* **Expected Output:** The program should correctly print numbers divisible by 3, 5, and both within this range. Verify against a manually calculated list.  For example, divisible by both 3 and 5 should output: 15 30 45 60 75 90.

**2. Boundary Cases:**

* **Input Range:** 0 to 100  (Check inclusivity of 0)
* **Input Range:** 1 to 105 (Check inclusivity of number at upper boundary)
* **Expected Output:** Ensure that the program handles the boundary values correctly.  0 is divisible by 3 and 5. 105 should be printed in the lists for 3 and 5, but not both.

**3. Empty Range:**

* **Input Range:** 101 to 100 (Empty range)
* **Expected Output:** The program should not print anything or handle the empty range gracefully without errors.

**4. Negative Range:**

* **Input Range:** -100 to 0
* **Expected Output:**  While not explicitly required, consider how the program should behave with negative numbers. Correct behavior would be to print the negative multiples of 3, 5, and 15.

**5. Large Range:**

* **Input Range:** 1 to 10000 (A larger range to test performance � though the algorithm is efficient already)
* **Expected Output:** Correctly print the multiples within the larger range.

**6. Single Number Range:**

* **Input Range:** 15 to 15.
* **Expected Output:** Should correctly output 15 in all three lists.


**How to Automate the Tests (Optional but Recommended)**

While you can manually verify the output, automated tests are more robust.  Here's a basic JUnit example (you would need to add the JUnit library to your project):
