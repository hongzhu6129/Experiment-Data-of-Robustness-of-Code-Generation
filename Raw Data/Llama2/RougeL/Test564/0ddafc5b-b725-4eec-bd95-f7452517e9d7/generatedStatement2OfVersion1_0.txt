This code calculates and displays the first 10 Fermat numbers.  It uses a helper function `calculateFermatNumber` to keep the main method clean.  Because Fermat numbers grow very large quickly, we use `long` to store them. However, even `long` will not be sufficient for Fermat numbers beyond the first few.  If you need to work with larger Fermat numbers, you would have to use `BigInteger`.


Here's a version using `BigInteger` if you need to handle arbitrarily large Fermat numbers:
