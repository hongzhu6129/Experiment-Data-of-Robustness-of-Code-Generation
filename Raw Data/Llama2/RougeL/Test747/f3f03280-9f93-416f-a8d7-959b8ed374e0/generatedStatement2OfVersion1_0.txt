Key improvements and explanations of the test cases:

* **JUnit 5:** The test cases now use JUnit 5 (Jupiter), which is the current best practice for unit testing in Java.
* **Clearer Assertions:**  Using `assertEquals` and `assertThrows` makes the test results very easy to understand.
* **Corner Case Coverage:** The test suite now includes corner cases like empty strings, single-character strings, and null strings.  This is essential for robust testing.
* **Whitespace Handling:**  Tests are added to check the handling of leading and trailing whitespace, ensuring the function behaves correctly in these situations.
* **Numbers and Special Characters:** A test is included to verify that the function handles strings containing numbers and special characters correctly.
* **Main Method Examples:**  I've added a few examples to the `main` method to demonstrate how to use the `concatenateStrings` function and also show how the exceptions are thrown when invalid input is provided.
* **Exception Handling in Main:** The `main` method now demonstrates how to catch and handle the `IllegalArgumentException` that your function correctly throws.


How to run the JUnit tests:

1. **IDE:** If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, it will have built-in support for running JUnit tests.  Just right-click on the test class and select "Run".
2. **Command Line:** You can compile and run the tests from the command line using the following commands (assuming you have JUnit 5 on your classpath):
