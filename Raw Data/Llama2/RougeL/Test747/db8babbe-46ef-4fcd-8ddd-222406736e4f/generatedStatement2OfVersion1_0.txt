Key improvements and explanations:

* **JUnit Tests:**  The code now includes comprehensive JUnit tests to cover various scenarios:
    * Valid strings
    * Null strings
    * Empty strings
    * Single-character strings (corner cases)
    * Strings with repeated initial characters (to ensure correct removal)

* **Clearer Error Handling:**  Uses `IllegalArgumentException` with a descriptive message to indicate invalid input.

* **Corner Case Coverage:** The tests specifically address the corner cases of strings with length 1.

* **Main Method for Demonstration:** A `main` method is included to show a simple example of how to use the function.


How to Run the Tests:

1. **IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse):**  If you're using an IDE, it will likely have built-in support for running JUnit tests. Right-click on the test class or individual test methods and select "Run."

2. **Command Line:**
   - Compile: `javac StringConcatenation.java`
   - Run: `java org.junit.platform.console.ConsoleLauncher --class StringConcatenation` (You might need to adjust the classpath to include the JUnit library if it's not already configured).


This improved version provides a more robust and testable solution for the string concatenation problem.  The test cases are essential for verifying that the function works correctly in all situations, including edge cases and potential error conditions.
