Key Improvements and Explanations:

1. **Multiple Methods:** Demonstrates three different approaches: `toString()`, iteration, and Java 8 Streams.
2. **Order Preservation:** The iteration and Stream methods now correctly maintain the order of elements as they are retrieved from the priority queue.  `toString()` doesn't guarantee a specific order.
3. **Custom Objects:**  Includes a clear example of how to handle a `PriorityQueue` of custom objects by implementing a `toString()` method in your custom class and using the stream approach.
4. **Clarity and Comments:** Improved comments explain each method and its benefits.
5. **Conciseness (Streams):** The Java 8 Stream approach provides a more concise and elegant way to convert the queue to a string.
6. **Error Handling:** The iterative approach now includes a check to avoid errors with empty queues.
7. **Custom Object Example Enhanced:** The `MyObject` class and its usage are more complete and illustrative.




This revised answer provides a more comprehensive and practical solution for converting a `PriorityQueue` to a `String` representation in Java, covering various scenarios and best practices.
