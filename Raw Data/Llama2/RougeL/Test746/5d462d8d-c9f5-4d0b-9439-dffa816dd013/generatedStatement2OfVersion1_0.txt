Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Comparator Implementation:**  The `StringLengthComparator` is now a separate, nested static class. This makes the code more organized and reusable.  The `compare` method clearly compares strings based on their lengths using `Integer.compare` (more robust than simple subtraction).

2. **Demonstrates Reverse Sorting:** The code now shows how to easily reverse the sort order using `Collections.reverseOrder()` (or the more modern `reversed()` directly on the Comparator) which is a much cleaner approach than modifying the `compare` method itself.

3. **Informative Output:** The `println` statements clearly indicate what is being printed, making it easier to understand the output.

4. **Adherence to Method Signature Requirements:**  The code strictly adheres to the requested method signatures (`main` and `compare`).


How it works:

* A `TreeMap` is created using a custom `Comparator` (`StringLengthComparator`).
* The `StringLengthComparator`'s `compare` method determines the sorting order.  It compares the lengths of the two input strings.
* When elements are added to the `TreeMap`, the `compare` method is used to maintain the sorted order based on string length.
* The `reversed()` method provides an easy way to create a reverse-sorted TreeMap.
