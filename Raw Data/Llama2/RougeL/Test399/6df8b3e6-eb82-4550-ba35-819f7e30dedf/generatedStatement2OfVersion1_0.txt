Key improvements in this code:

* **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueIndex` instead of just `j` makes the code more readable.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** Explicitly handles `null` and empty input arrays.
* **Concise Logic:**  The core logic of the `removeDuplicates` method is efficient and straightforward.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes multiple test cases, including edge cases, to demonstrate the function's correctness.
* **Informative Output:** Prints the new length and the modified array (up to the new length) for better understanding.
* **In-Place Modification:** Modifies the original array as requested, avoiding the creation of new arrays (except in the output for printing where it's necessary to avoid printing the unmodified portions of the array).



This revised code adheres to the requested method signatures, provides clear and efficient logic, and handles various scenarios correctly.
