Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `DateTimeParseException` if the input string doesn't match the expected format. This makes the code more robust.
* **Clearer Output:**  The output messages are more informative, clearly indicating whether the conversion was successful or if an error occurred.
* **Multiple Formats:**  Demonstrates how to format `LocalDateTime` to different string patterns using different `DateTimeFormatter` instances, providing more flexibility.
* **Current Date/Time:** Shows how to get the current date and time using `LocalDateTime.now()`.
* **Best Practices:** Uses `java.time` (introduced in Java 8), which is the modern and recommended way to handle dates and times in Java.  It's significantly better than older classes like `Date` and `Calendar`.



Example Usage and Output:

If you run the code with the provided `dateString`, the output will be similar to:
