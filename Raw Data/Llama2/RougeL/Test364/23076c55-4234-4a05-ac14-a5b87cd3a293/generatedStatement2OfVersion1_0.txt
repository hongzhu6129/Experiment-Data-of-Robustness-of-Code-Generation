**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **`calculatePi(int numTerms)` Method:**  This method now takes an integer `numTerms` as input, making it much more flexible. You can easily calculate Pi with different numbers of terms without modifying the core logic.

2. **Clearer Loop and Calculation:** The loop now iterates from 0 to `numTerms - 1`. The denominator is calculated directly inside the loop: `2 * i + 1`. This makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.

3. **Correct Alternating Signs:** The `if (i % 2 == 0)` condition ensures the terms are added and subtracted correctly according to the Leibniz formula.

4. **`double` for Precision:**  The calculations use `double` to maintain better precision, which is essential when approximating Pi.

5. **Demonstrates Both Calculations:**  The `main` method now calls `calculatePi` twice, once with 5 terms and once with 6, to demonstrate both requested calculations.

6. **Clear Output:** The output is formatted clearly to indicate how many terms were used for each approximation.


This improved version is more efficient, readable, and easily adaptable for different numbers of terms in the Pi approximation.
