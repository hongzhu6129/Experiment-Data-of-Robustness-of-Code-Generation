Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `inputArr` and `array` are more descriptive than just `arr`.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes a check for null or empty input array at the beginning of `sort()`.
* **Concise Comments:** Comments are more focused on explaining the logic rather than restating the code.
* **Standard Pivot Selection:** Uses the middle element as the pivot, a common and generally good choice.  You could explore other pivot selection strategies for further optimization (median-of-three, random, etc.).
* **Output Added to Main:** The `main` method now prints the sorted array to demonstrate the functionality.



This improved version provides a more robust and understandable implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm while adhering to the specified method signatures.
