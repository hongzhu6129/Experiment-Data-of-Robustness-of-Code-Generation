 Only use the method signatures  void merge(int[], int, int, int),  void sort(int[], int, int), public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the Merge Sort Algorithm. According to Wikipedia "Merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an O (n log n) comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output."\n\n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n Avoid using Solution as the class name.
