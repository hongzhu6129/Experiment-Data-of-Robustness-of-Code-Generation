To compile and run this:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `GetCharacterAtIndex.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:  `javac GetCharacterAtIndex.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the program with the string and index as command-line arguments: `java GetCharacterAtIndex "Hello World" 6` (This will get the character at index 6, which is 'W').


**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:**  The code now includes robust error handling for invalid input (incorrect number of arguments, non-integer index, index out of bounds).  This makes the program more user-friendly and prevents crashes.
* **Command-Line Arguments:** The program takes the string and index as command-line arguments (using `args`), making it more flexible and reusable.
* **Unicode Code Point:** It prints both the character itself and its Unicode code point using `codePointAt()`. This is especially important for characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), such as emojis.
* **Supplementary Character Handling:** The updated code demonstrates how to handle supplementary characters correctly. These characters are represented by two Java `char` values (surrogate pairs) but correspond to a single Unicode code point.  The loop example shows the recommended way to iterate and extract these code points using `codePointAt()`, `Character.toChars()`, and `Character.charCount()`.


This improved version provides a much more complete and robust solution for getting a character at a given index, addressing potential issues with various types of input and character sets.
