**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`isCube()` Method:** This helper method encapsulates the cube checking logic. It makes the `main` method cleaner and reusable.

2. **Handling Negative Numbers:**  The code now correctly handles negative numbers. The cube of a negative number is negative.  We use `isCube(-number)` to check the absolute value if the input is negative.

3. **Efficient Cube Root Calculation:** The most efficient way to check if a number is a perfect cube is to calculate its integer cube root using `Math.cbrt()` and then check if the cube of the root is equal to the original number. This avoids iterating through all possible cubes, especially for large numbers.

4. **Clear Output:** The output messages are informative, indicating whether the number is a cube or not.

5. **Input:** The example uses `number = 8`.  For real user input, you would replace this with code to read the number from the console or other input source.  For example:
