Explanation of Improvements:

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The original code didn't handle negative numbers correctly.  A negative number can be a perfect cube (e.g., -8 is the cube of -2).  The improved code now correctly checks for negative cubes.

2. **More Efficient Cube Root Calculation:** Using `Math.cbrt(n)`  (cube root function) is more efficient and direct than iterating through numbers.  It also avoids potential overflow issues that could occur with very large numbers when calculating `n^(1/3)`.

3. **Precise Integer Comparison:** Casting the cube root to an `int` and then cubing it ensures we are checking for perfect integer cubes. This avoids floating-point inaccuracies that could arise from directly comparing `Math.cbrt(n)` with its cubed value.
