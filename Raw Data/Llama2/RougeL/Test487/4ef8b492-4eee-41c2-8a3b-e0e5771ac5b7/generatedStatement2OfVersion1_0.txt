Key improvements:

* **Handles negative numbers:** The code now correctly identifies negative cubes (e.g., -8).
* **Optimization:** The loop iterates only up to the cube root of `n`, significantly improving efficiency for larger numbers.
* **Clearer structure:**  Using a helper function `isCube` makes the code more organized and readable.
* **Test cases:** The `main` method now includes several test cases to demonstrate the functionality.  The `testCube` function helps organize test output.
* **Zero handled explicitly:** Added a specific check for the case when n is 0.


This revised solution is more robust and efficient in determining whether a given number is a perfect cube, considering both positive and negative integers.
