This enhanced example demonstrates:

1. **`equals()` method:**  The most direct way to check for equality.  Two `ArrayLists` are equal if they have the same elements in the same order.

2. **`Collections.disjoint()`:** Checks if two lists have *no* elements in common. Useful if you want to determine if the lists are completely separate.

3. **`containsAll()` method:** Checks if one list contains all the elements of another list (irrespective of order).  This lets you determine if one list is a subset or superset of the other.


I've also added clear comments and examples to show how these methods behave in different scenarios (when lists are equal, unequal, have common elements, or are disjoint).  This should give you a comprehensive understanding of how to compare `ArrayLists` in Java.
