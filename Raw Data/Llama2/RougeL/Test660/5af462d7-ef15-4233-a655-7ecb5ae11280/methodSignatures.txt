 Only use the method signatures public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the problem description: notes a Java program to check whether a number is an automorphic number or not. in mathematics, an automorphic number is a number whose square ends in the same digits as the number itself. for example, 5 = 25, 6 = 36, 76 = 5776, and 890625 = 793212890625, so 5, 6, 76 and 890625 are all automorphic numbers. input a number: 76 automorphic number.
The programming language is Java.
