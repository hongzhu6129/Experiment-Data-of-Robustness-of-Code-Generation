Key improvements in this version:

1. **Handles Empty Array:**  Added a check at the beginning of `removeDuplicates` to correctly handle an empty input array.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `uniqueCount` instead of `j` makes the code more readable.

3. **More Comprehensive Test Cases:** Added examples with an empty array and an array with no duplicates in `main` to demonstrate robustness.

4. **Prints the Modified Array (Partially):**   The original problem asked for the length of the updated array.  To make it easier to see what's happening, the `main` method now also prints the relevant portion of the modified array (up to the new length) using `Arrays.copyOfRange`.  The original array is modified in place, which is the typical behavior for this type of problem (saving space).

5. **Concise Comments:** Comments are focused on explaining the logic rather than restating the obvious.
