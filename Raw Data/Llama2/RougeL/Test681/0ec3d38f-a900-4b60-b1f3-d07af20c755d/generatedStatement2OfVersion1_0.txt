Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Comments:** Added comprehensive Javadoc-style comments to the `binarySearch` method, explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.

2. **Overflow Prevention:**  `int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;` prevents potential integer overflow that could occur if `low + high` exceeded the maximum integer value.

3. **Comprehensive `main` method:**  Included multiple test cases in `main` to demonstrate different scenarios:
   - Element present in the array
   - Element not present in the array
   - Handling an unsorted array (including how to sort it if necessary)
   - Handling an empty array

4. **Informative Output:** Improved the output messages to clearly indicate the target value and whether it was found, along with its index.

5. **Correctness for unsorted input:**  Added a note and example showing how to sort the array *before* calling binary search if the input is not guaranteed to be sorted.  Binary search *requires* a sorted array to function correctly.



This revised code provides a more robust, well-documented, and demonstrably correct implementation of binary search in Java.
