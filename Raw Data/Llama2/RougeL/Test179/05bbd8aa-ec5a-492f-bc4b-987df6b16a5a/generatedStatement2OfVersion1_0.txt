Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:**  The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user provides non-integer input for the year or month.  This prevents the program from crashing. It also checks if the correct number of arguments is provided.
* **Clearer Output:** The dates are now formatted using `DateTimeFormatter` for a consistent and readable output (e.g., "yyyy-MM-dd").
* **Flexibility:**  The code now takes optional command-line arguments for year and month. If no arguments are given, it defaults to the current year and month.
* **Best Practices:** Using `YearMonth` is the most direct and efficient way to work with first and last days of a month in modern Java.

2. **Compile:**  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then compile:
