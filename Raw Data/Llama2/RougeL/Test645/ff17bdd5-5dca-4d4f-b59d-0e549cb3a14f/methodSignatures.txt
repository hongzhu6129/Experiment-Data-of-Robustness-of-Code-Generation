 Only use the method signatures public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program to check if a number is cyclic or not. A cyclic number is an integer in which cyclic permutations of the digits are successive multiples of the number. The most widely known are 142857: 142857 × 1 = 142857 142857 × 2 = 285714 142857 × 3 = 428571 142857 × 4 = 571428 142857 × 5 = 714285 142857 × 6 = 857142 Input Data: Input a number: 142857\nIt is a cyclic number.\n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n
