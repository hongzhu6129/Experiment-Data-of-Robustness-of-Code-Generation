**Explanation:**

The core of checking if Java is installed relies on the fact that if this Java code runs at all, Java *must* be installed and working.  So, the program's successful execution is the primary indicator.  

To provide more details about the Java installation, the code then utilizes `System.getProperty()` to retrieve and print various system properties related to the Java environment, such as the version, runtime version, installation directory (Java home), vendor, and classpath.  These properties are readily available if a Java runtime environment is present and functioning.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code above as a file named `CheckJavaInstallation.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler:
