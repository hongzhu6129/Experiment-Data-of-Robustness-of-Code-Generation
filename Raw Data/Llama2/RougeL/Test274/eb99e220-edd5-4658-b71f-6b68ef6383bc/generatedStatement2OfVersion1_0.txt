Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer output:** The output now explicitly states whether the number is a palindrome or not, following the prompt's requested format.
* **Efficient `reverse_nums`:** The `reverse_nums` function efficiently reverses the integer using a standard algorithm.
* **Concise `is_Palindrome`:** The `is_Palindrome` function directly compares the original number with its reversed version for a clean and readable check.
* **Example Input:** Added an example input within the `main` method for demonstration.  You can easily modify this to take user input if needed.


If you want to take user input, you can modify the `main` method like this:
