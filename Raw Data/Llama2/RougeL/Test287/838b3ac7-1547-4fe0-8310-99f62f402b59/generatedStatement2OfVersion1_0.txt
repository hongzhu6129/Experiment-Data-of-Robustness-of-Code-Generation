Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles Edge Cases:** Explicitly checks for null or empty input streams and prints -1 accordingly.
- **Uses LinkedHashMap:** `LinkedHashMap` is used to maintain the insertion order of characters. This is crucial for finding the *first* non-repeating character.
- **Clearer Output:**  Prints -1 if no non-repeating character is found, providing more informative output.
- **Simplified Logic:**  The code is more concise and easier to understand.
- **Efficiency:**  The logic has a single pass through the string, making it more efficient for large streams.
