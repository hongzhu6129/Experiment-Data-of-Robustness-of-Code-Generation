| 777 | 1FF | Largest three-digit octal |
| 1000 | 200 | Tests the rollover to the next hex place |
| -10 | Invalid octal number. | Negative numbers are invalid |
| 8 | Invalid octal number. | Digits greater than 7 are invalid  |
| 999 | Invalid octal number. | Digits greater than 7 are invalid |

This improved version handles invalid octal digits and includes comprehensive test cases covering different scenarios including corner cases like 0, largest octal values, and invalid inputs.  The comments also clarify the logic.  This code avoids using any methods other than `main` as requested, even for the conversion steps, handling everything directly within the `main` method.
