**Explanation and Corrections:**

1. **Formula Correction:** The provided formula in the prompt had a typo.  It should alternate signs (subtraction and addition) consistently.  I've corrected it in the code above.
2. **Term Count:** The question asked for approximations with 5 and 6 terms. The original prompt had a repeating `(1/9)` and skipped `(1/7)`.  The code now calculates correctly with 5 and 6 alternating terms.
3. **Using 1.0:**  The prompt instructed to use `1.0` instead of `1`. This has been done in the code to ensure floating-point division for accuracy.
4. **Clarity and Output:**  Added comments and clear output statements to indicate the number of terms used in each approximation.


This improved code calculates the Pi approximations as requested using the correct formula and the specified number of terms.
