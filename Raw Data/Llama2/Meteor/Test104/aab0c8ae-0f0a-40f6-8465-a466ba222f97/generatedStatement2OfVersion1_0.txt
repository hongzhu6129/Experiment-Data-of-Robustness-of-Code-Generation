**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner/edge cases:

1. **Positive Number:**
   - Input: `7`
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 7 from 7x1 to 7x11.

2. **Zero:**
   - Input: `0`
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 0 (all results will be 0). This tests the handling of zero.

3. **Negative Number:**
   - Input: `-5`
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of -5 from -5x1 to -5x11. This tests handling of negative numbers.

4. **Large Positive Number:**
   - Input: `10000`  (or any large number)
   - Expected Output:  Multiplication table of 10000. This tests handling of larger numbers.

5. **Large Negative Number:**
   - Input: `-10000` (or any large negative number)
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of -10000. This tests handling of larger negative numbers.

6. **One:**
   - Input: `1`
   - Expected Output: Multiplication table of 1 (which is simply the numbers 1 to 11). This tests the lower boundary.


**How to run the test cases:**

You can manually run these tests by inputting the values when prompted by the program.  For more automated testing, you could use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a simple example of how you could structure a JUnit test:
