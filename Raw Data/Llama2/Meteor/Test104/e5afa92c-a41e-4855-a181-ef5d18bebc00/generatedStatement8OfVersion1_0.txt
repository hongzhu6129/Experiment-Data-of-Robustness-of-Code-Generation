**4. Large Number (Corner Case):**

* **Input:** 214748364  (Close to Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 to test for potential overflow.  Use a slightly smaller number to prevent the last multiplication from exceeding Integer.MAX_VALUE)
* **Expected Output:**  The table should print correctly without overflow.


**5. Very Large Number (Overflow Corner Case):**

* **Input:**  2147483647 (Integer.MAX_VALUE).
* **Expected Output:** "Input number is too large or too small. Multiplication may cause overflow." (or behavior indicative of overflow if the overflow check is not included)


**6. Very Small Number (Overflow Corner Case):**

* **Input:** -2147483648 (Integer.MIN_VALUE).
* **Expected Output:**  "Input number is too large or too small. Multiplication may cause overflow." (or behavior indicative of overflow if the overflow check is not included).



This comprehensive set of test cases covers various scenarios and corner cases, helping to ensure that the `printMultiplicationTable` method works correctly.  The overflow check now ensures that the program handles extreme input values gracefully.
