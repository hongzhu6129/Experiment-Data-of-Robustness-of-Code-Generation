Key improvements in this version:

- **Clearer helper function:** The `containsDigit7` function is now separated, making the `count_nums_not_7` function more readable.
- **More comprehensive testing:** The `main` method now includes test cases with different inputs, including numbers containing 7 and the edge case of 0.
- **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic and purpose of each part of the code.  Good comments are essential for maintainability.


This revised answer addresses the prompt's requirements more effectively and presents a more robust and understandable solution.
