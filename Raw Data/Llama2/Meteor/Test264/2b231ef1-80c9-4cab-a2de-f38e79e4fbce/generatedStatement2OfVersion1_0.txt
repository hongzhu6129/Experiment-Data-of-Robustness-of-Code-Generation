Key improvements in this revised code:

- **Clarity and Readability:** Improved variable names (`containsDigit7`) and comments make the code easier to understand.
- **Helper Function:** The `containsDigit7` function encapsulates the logic for checking the presence of the digit 7, making the `count_nums_not_7` function cleaner.
- **Efficiency:** The `containsDigit7` function now uses a `while` loop and the modulo operator (`%`) for a slightly more efficient way to check digits.
- **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `count_nums_not_7` function with different inputs, making the code more practical.  It also includes an example with an input greater than 70 (700) to demonstrate that scenario.



This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and demonstrates better coding practices.
