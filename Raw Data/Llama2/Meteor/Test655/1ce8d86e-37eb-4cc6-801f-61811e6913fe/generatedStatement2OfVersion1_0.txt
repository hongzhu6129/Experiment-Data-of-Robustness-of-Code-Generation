**Test Cases:**

While this program doesn't take any input, we can still perform some basic tests:

2. **Whitespace Test (Corner Case):**  Ensure that the whitespace (tabs and newlines) are correctly placed.  A subtle error could be an extra space or a missing tab.  One way to test this thoroughly would be to redirect the output to a file and then compare it to a file containing the expected output character by character.  This could be done with a diff tool or a small script. Example (using bash):
