**Test Cases:**

1. **Positive Number:**
   - Input: 12345
   - Expected Output: 15

2. **Negative Number:**
   - Input: -9876
   - Expected Output: 30

3. **Single Digit Number:**
   - Input: 7
   - Expected Output: 7

4. **Zero:**
   - Input: 0
   - Expected Output: 0

5. **Large Number:**
   - Input: 1234567890
   - Expected Output: 45

6. **Number with repeating digits:**
   - Input: 77777
   - Expected Output: 35


**Explanation of Corner Cases and Considerations:**

* **Negative Numbers:** The code uses `Math.abs(n)` to handle negative numbers correctly.  The sum of digits should be the same regardless of the sign.
* **Zero:** Zero is a special case where the loop should terminate immediately, and the sum should be 0. The code handles this correctly.
* **Large Numbers:**  The code works with large numbers within the `int` data type's range. If you anticipate numbers exceeding this range, consider using `long` instead.
* **Integer Overflow (Less Likely with digit sums, but good practice):**  If you were performing operations other than summing digits and were concerned about the possibility of intermediate results exceeding the `int` or `long` range, you might want to incorporate checks or use `BigInteger`.  For digit sums, overflow is unlikely because the sum of digits is generally much smaller than the number itself.


This revised response provides a complete Java program, incorporates error handling for non-integer input (though it assumes correct input in the test cases section), and includes a comprehensive set of test cases covering corner and edge cases.  It also explains why each test case is important.
