**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Null and Empty Input:**  The `excludeHash` method now handles `null` and empty input strings gracefully, returning an empty string in these cases.

2. **StringBuilder for Efficiency:**  Using `StringBuilder` is much more efficient than repeated string concatenation (using `+` or `concat`) especially when modifying strings inside a loop.

3. **Clearer Logic for Adjacent Character Removal:** The code explicitly checks for left and right adjacent characters before removing them and uses relative indexing with i and the StringBuilder, making it more readable and less error-prone. The `deleteCharAt` method of StringBuilder is also used now correctly.

4. **Handles '#' at the beginning/end:** The code is robust and works correctly even if '#' is at the beginning or the end of the input string.
