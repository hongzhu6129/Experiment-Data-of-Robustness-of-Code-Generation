This educational example demonstrates the `floorKey()` method of the `TreeMap` class in Java.  It shows how to find the greatest key less than or equal to a given key, including handling edge cases like when the key is less than the smallest key, greater than the largest key, when the TreeMap is empty, and when null values are present.  The comments explain each scenario and the expected output. The example also demonstrates how `TreeMap` handles `null` keys (throws `NullPointerException`) and `null` values (permitted).
