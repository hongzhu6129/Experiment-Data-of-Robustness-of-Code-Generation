While the prompt requests using only `public static void main(String[] args)`,  it's generally poor practice to cram all the logic directly into `main`.  The solution above uses a helper function `printBooleanArray` to keep the code organized and readable.  If absolutely necessary, the contents of  `printBooleanArray` *could* be inlined into `main`, but it's highly discouraged for anything beyond the simplest examples.  Good code structure is important even for small programs.


Here's the inlined version (less readable and maintainable, but technically fulfills the prompt's overly restrictive requirement):
