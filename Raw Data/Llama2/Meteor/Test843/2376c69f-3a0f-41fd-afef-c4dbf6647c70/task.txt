Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program to print out the first 10 Catalan numbers by extracting them from Pascal's triangle. In combinatorial mathematics, the Catalan numbers form a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursively-defined objects. They are named after the Belgian mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan. The first Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, 16796, 58786, 208012, 742900, 2674440, 9694845, 35357670, 129644790, 477638700, 1767263190, 6564120420, 24466267020, 91482563640, 343059613650, 1289904147324, 4861946401452,\nList 10 Catalan numbers:-                                               \n                                                                        \n1                                                                       \n2                                                                       \n5                                                                       \n14                                                                      \n42                                                                      \n132                                                                     \n429                                                                     \n1430                                                                    \n4862                                                                    \n16796\n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n Problem Id is : 2376c69f-3a0f-41fd-afef-c4dbf6647c70.\n
