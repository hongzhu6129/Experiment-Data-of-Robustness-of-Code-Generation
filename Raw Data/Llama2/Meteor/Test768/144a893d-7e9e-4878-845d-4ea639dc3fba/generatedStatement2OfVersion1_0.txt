Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:**  Includes robust error handling for invalid `startingPosition` values (out of bounds or negative), providing clear feedback to the user.
* **Clarity and Comments:** More comments explain the code's logic and handle edge cases.
* **ListIterator:** Uses a `ListIterator` which is specifically designed for traversing lists and allows starting from a specified position efficiently.
* **Multiple Examples in `main`:** Demonstrates usage with different starting positions, including valid, invalid, and edge cases, to showcase the robustness of the `iterateFromPosition` method.
* **Clearer Output:**  Prints the elements from the specified position clearly.

This revised code is more robust, easier to understand, and provides a more complete solution.
