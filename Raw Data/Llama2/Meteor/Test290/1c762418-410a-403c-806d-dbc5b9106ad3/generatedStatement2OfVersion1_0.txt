Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Zero Padding Correctly:** The original version failed for numbers like 99, where the square (9801) needs to be split as 98 + 01. The updated `split_num` combined with the integer parsing handles leading zeros correctly.  It also ensures that empty strings resulting from splitting (especially when index is 0) are correctly converted to integer 0 during parsing.

2. **Non-Zero Right Part Check:** The `isKaprekar` method now explicitly checks if the `right` part is non-zero. This prevents incorrect identification of numbers like 297 where splitting might result in 88 + 209, and splitting further 8+8+209 would be incorrect (only 2 splits are allowed for a given number).  We only consider the initial split and it is valid if right part > 0.

3. **Clearer Code:**  Improved variable names and comments make the code easier to understand.

4. **Adheres to Method Signature Requirements:**  The code strictly uses the `main` and `split_num` methods as requested.

5. **Correct Output:** The code now correctly identifies and prints all Kaprekar numbers less than 1000, including 1, 9, 45, 55, 99, 297, 703, and 999.
