Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is formatted for better readability with clear variable names and comments.
2. **Efficiency Optimizations:**  Several optimizations are added to significantly reduce execution time:
   - The inner loops break early when the sum of cubes exceeds `n` or the cube itself exceeds `n`.
   - The inner loop for `b` starts from `a + 1` and the loop for `d` starts from `c + 1` to avoid duplicate pairs and consider only distinct pairs.
3. **Correctness:** The `isSumOfTwoCubesInAnotherWay` method correctly checks if the sum can be expressed as the sum of two *different* pairs of cubes.
4. **Handles No Solution Case:** The code now prints a message if no such number is found within the given range.
5. **Adherence to Prompt:**  Uses only the `public static void main(String[] args)` method signature as requested.  Helper functions are made `private`.



This revised code is much more efficient and accurately addresses the problem of finding a number expressible as the sum of two cubes in at least two different ways.
