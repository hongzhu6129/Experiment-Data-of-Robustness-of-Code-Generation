Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Readability:** Variable names (a, b, c, d) clearly represent the components of the sums of cubes.
2. **Efficiency:**
   - The code now avoids redundant calculations by storing the cubes (a3, b3, c3, d3).
   - `break` statements are used within loops to exit early when further calculations are unnecessary (e.g., when `a3` exceeds `n`).
3. **Correctness:** The code ensures that `b` starts from `a + 1` and `d` starts from `c + 1` to prevent duplicate pairs and to enforce distinct pairs (a, b) and (c, d). The comparison `(a != c || b != d)` ensures that the two representations are distinct.
4. **Adherence to Problem Statement:** The code now adheres strictly to the prompt by only including the `main` method.  It also returns after finding the *first* Ramanujan number (1729), just like the original Princeton example. You can remove the `return` statement if you want to find *all* Ramanujan numbers within the given range.



This revised version is significantly more efficient and easier to understand, addressing the issues and inefficiencies present in earlier versions.
