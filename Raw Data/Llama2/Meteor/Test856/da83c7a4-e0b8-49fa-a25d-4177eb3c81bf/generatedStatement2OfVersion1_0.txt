**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Case-Insensitive Counting:**  The `CountCharacters` method now converts the input string to lowercase using `str.toLowerCase()` before counting.  This ensures that 'P' and 'p' are treated as the same character.

2. **Clearer Output:** The `showDuplicates` method now provides clearer output:
   - It prints the original string being analyzed.
   - It explicitly states "None" if no duplicates are found.
   - A newline is added at the end of each output for better readability.

3. **`charCounts` Array Size:** The `charCounts` array is initialized to size 26 (number of lowercase English letters).  This is a reasonable assumption for many cases, but if you need to handle a wider range of characters (uppercase, special characters, etc.), you would need to adjust the array size and the logic within `CountCharacters` accordingly. 

4. **`foundDuplicates` flag:**  This boolean flag is used to print "None" only if no duplicates have actually been found. This prevents unnecessary printing of "None" even when duplicates are present.


This improved version addresses the limitations of the previous response and provides a more robust and user-friendly solution.
