**Key Improvements and Features:**

* **Error Handling:**  The code now includes robust error handling. It checks for:
    * Incorrect number of command-line arguments.
    * Non-positive integer input for `n`.
    * Non-integer input (NumberFormatException).  This makes the program more user-friendly and prevents crashes.
* **Clear Usage Instructions:**  The `main` method provides clear usage instructions if the user provides incorrect command-line arguments.
* **Sequential Numbering:**  The matrix is filled with sequentially increasing numbers from 1 to n*n, which is a common way to visualize matrix indices or elements.
* **Clear Formatting:** The output is nicely formatted with spaces between elements and newlines after each row, making the matrix easy to read.


This improved version addresses the potential issues and makes the code more practical and robust.
