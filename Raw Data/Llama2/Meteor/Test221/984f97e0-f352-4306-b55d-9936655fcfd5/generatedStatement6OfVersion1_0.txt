   Replace `5` with the desired matrix size.

3. **Method `printMatrix(int n)`:**
   - This method takes the size `n` as input.
   - It uses nested loops to iterate through rows and columns.
   - `System.out.print("X ")` prints an "X" followed by a space for each cell in the matrix.  You can change "X" to any character or even calculate and print a value here if needed (e.g., `i*j`, `i+j`, etc.)
   - `System.out.println()` prints a new line after each row is complete, creating the matrix structure.

4. **Method `main(String[] args)`:**
   - Handles command-line arguments to get the value of `n`.
   - Includes error handling (using a `try-catch` block) to check for invalid input (non-integer or negative `n`).
   - Calls the `printMatrix` method to generate and display the matrix.
