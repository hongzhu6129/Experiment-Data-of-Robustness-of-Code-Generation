**Test Cases:**

1. **Positive Side Length:**
   - Input: 5
   - Expected Output: ~64.95

2. **Small Positive Side Length:**
   - Input: 0.5
   - Expected Output: ~0.6495

3. **Large Positive Side Length:**
   - Input: 100
   - Expected Output: ~25980.76

4. **Zero Side Length (Corner Case):**
   - Input: 0
   - Expected Output: "Invalid input. Side length must be a positive number." (Program should terminate)

5. **Negative Side Length (Corner Case):**
   - Input: -5
   - Expected Output: "Invalid input. Side length must be a positive number." (Program should terminate)

6. **Non-Numeric Input (Corner Case):**
    - Input: abc  (or any non-numeric value).
    - Expected behavior. The program will likely throw an `InputMismatchException`. While the provided code doesn't explicitly handle this, robust programs would include a `try-catch` block to gracefully handle such input errors.  This would prevent the program from crashing and allow you to provide a more user-friendly error message.

**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. **Save:** Save the Java code as `HexagonArea.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using the command: `javac HexagonArea.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled program using: `java HexagonArea`
4. **Input:** Enter the test case input values when prompted.
5. **Verify:** Check if the output matches the expected output for each test case.


This enhanced version includes error handling for invalid input (negative or zero side lengths), making the program more robust.  Consider adding a `try-catch` block within the `main` method to handle potential `InputMismatchException` if a user enters non-numeric input. Although the prompt requested minimizing methods, exception handling is crucial for real-world applications.
