Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

1. **Multiple Copying Methods:**  Demonstrates three different ways to copy a LinkedList:
   - **Constructor:** `LinkedList<Integer> copiedList1 = new LinkedList<>(originalList);` This is generally the most efficient way to copy a `LinkedList` as it's implemented internally to be optimized.
   - **`addAll()`:** `copiedList2.addAll(originalList);`  Another concise and commonly used approach.
   - **Manual Copy (Iteration):**  Included for illustrative purposes to show the fundamental logic. However, it's typically less efficient than the constructor or `addAll()`.

2. **Clearer Output and Verification:**  The code now clearly prints the original and copied lists to verify the copying process. It also demonstrates that modifications to the copy do *not* affect the original list, and vice versa, proving that a deep copy (independent copies) has been made.

3. **Comments:** Added more comments to explain the different methods and the purpose of the verification steps.

4. **Example Modifications:** The code now modifies both the original and a copied list *after* the copying to show that they are independent.  This is a crucial demonstration of a proper copy.


This improved example provides a more comprehensive understanding of how to copy `LinkedLists` in Java and the different methods available. It also highlights the importance of verifying that the copy is independent of the original.
