Explanation and improvements:

1. **User Input:** The program now takes user input for both the string and the character to count using the `Scanner` class. This makes it more interactive.

2. **Character Counting Logic:** The core logic remains the same � iterating through the string and incrementing the `count` whenever the target character is found.

3. **Clear Output:** The output message is more informative, clearly indicating the character being counted and its total occurrences.

4. **Execution Time Measurement:**  The `displayExecutionTime` method is used to show the execution time of the counting process.

5. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed at the end of the `main` method using `scanner.close()` to release the resource. This is good practice.
