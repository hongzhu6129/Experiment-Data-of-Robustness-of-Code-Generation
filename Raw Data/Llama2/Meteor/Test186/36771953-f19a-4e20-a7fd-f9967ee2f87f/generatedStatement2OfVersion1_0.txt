Explanation and Improvements:

1. **User Input:** The code now takes both the string and the character to search for as input from the user using the `Scanner` class. This makes it more flexible.
2. **Character Counting Logic:**  The core logic remains efficient, iterating through the string character by character and incrementing the `count` when a match is found.
3. **Clear Output:** The output message is formatted to clearly show the character being counted and its number of occurrences.
4. **Execution Time Measurement:** The `displayExecutionTime` method is used to measure and display the execution time of the core logic in nanoseconds. The timer starts before the counting loop and ends after it.
5. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` to release the resource.
6. **Error Handling (Optional):**  You could add error handling (e.g., using a `try-catch` block) to deal with potential issues like the user entering an empty string or a string longer than what your system can handle.
