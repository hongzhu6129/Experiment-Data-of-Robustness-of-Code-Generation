Key improvements:

- **Handles edge cases:**  The code now explicitly checks for null or empty input strings and returns an empty string in these cases, preventing `NullPointerException` or other unexpected behavior.
- **Clearer logic:** The use of `indexOf` simplifies the substring search. The code directly checks the character before and after the substring based on its index.
- **StringBuilder for efficiency:** Using `StringBuilder` for building the result string is more efficient than repeated string concatenation, especially if the substring is found multiple times (though this problem only requires finding the first occurrence).
- **Comprehensive test cases:** The `main` method includes various test cases to demonstrate the functionality with different inputs, including edge cases like empty strings, substrings at the beginning/end, and substrings not found.



This improved version addresses the potential issues in the previous responses and provides a more robust and efficient solution.
