Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Examples:** Demonstrates getting both the current year and information about a specific year.

2. **Multiple Approaches:** Shows how to get the current year using both `Year.now()` and `LocalDate.now().getYear()`.

3. **Specific Year Information:**  Illustrates getting whether a year is a leap year and its length using `Year.isLeap()` and `Year.length()`.

4. **`YearMonth` Example:** Added an example of how to work with a specific month in a given year using `YearMonth`. This shows how to get the length of a specific month, which is often useful in date/time calculations.

5. **Robust Input Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to demonstrate how to handle potential errors when getting year input from the command line.  This is *crucial* for real-world applications to prevent crashes due to bad input. It catches `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` (if no argument is provided), `NumberFormatException` (if the input is not an integer), and `DateTimeException` (if the year is out of the valid range).


To compile and run:

1. Save the code as `CurrentYearInfo.java`.
2. Compile: `javac CurrentYearInfo.java`
3. Run:  `java CurrentYearInfo 2025` (replace `2025` with any year you want to test as input or omit it to use the default current year handling)
