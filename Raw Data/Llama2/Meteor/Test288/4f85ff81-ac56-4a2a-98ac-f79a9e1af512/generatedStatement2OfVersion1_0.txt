**Test Cases (Including Corner Cases):**

1. **Valid Octal Numbers:**
   - Input: 123  Output: 001010011
   - Input: 705  Output: 111000101
   - Input: 42   Output: 100010
   - Input: 1    Output: 001

2. **Corner Cases:**
   - Input: 0    Output: 0
   - Input: "" (Empty String) Output: Input cannot be empty.
   - Input: 876 (Invalid Octal) Output: Invalid octal number. Digits must be between 0 and 7.
   - Input: 12a (Invalid Octal) Output: Invalid octal number. Digits must be between 0 and 7.
   - Input: a very large octal number (e.g., a number with 20 digits)  Output: The octal number is too large to handle. (This tests for overflow and uses the `try-catch` block.)

3. **Leading Zeros:**
   - Input: 000123 Output: 001010011 (Handles leading zeros correctly)


**How to Run and Test:**

1. Save the code as `OctalToBinary.java`.
2. Compile: `javac OctalToBinary.java`
3. Run: `java OctalToBinary`
4. Enter the test case input when prompted.


This improved version adds input validation, handles corner cases explicitly, and manages potential overflow with a `try-catch` block, making it more robust and user-friendly. It also uses a `long` to accommodate larger octal inputs, as requested.
