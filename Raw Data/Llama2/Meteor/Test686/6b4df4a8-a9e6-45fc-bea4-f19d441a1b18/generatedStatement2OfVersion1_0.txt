The original error "invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'sort'" likely came from trying to convert the string "sort" to an integer.  This revised code avoids that error entirely by implementing a proper merge sort algorithm without any string-to-integer conversions.  It uses the required method signatures: `merge(int[], int, int, int)`, `sort(int[], int, int)`, and `public static void main(String[])`.  It also includes a `printArray` helper function for demonstrating the sorting.
