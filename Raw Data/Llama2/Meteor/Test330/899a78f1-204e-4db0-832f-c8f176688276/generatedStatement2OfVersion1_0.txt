Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles empty arrays and arrays with already unique elements.
* **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueCount` is more descriptive than `k`.
* **In-place modification:** Modifies the original array directly as the problem requests.
* **Comprehensive `main` method:**  Demonstrates the function's behavior with multiple test cases including edge cases, and prints both the length and the modified array (up to the length returned).
* **Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`**:  This prevents printing the entire original array (which could still contain duplicate values after the `uniqueCount` index).  It cleanly shows the resulting unique elements section of the array.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic.
