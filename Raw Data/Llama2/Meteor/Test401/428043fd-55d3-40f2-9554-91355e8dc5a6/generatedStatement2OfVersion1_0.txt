**Explanation and Important Notes:**

1. **"Legitimacy Value" Definition:** The problem statement uses the non-standard term "legitimacy value." You must define what this means in your context. The code provides three example conversions in the `convert` method:
   - **Example 1:**  Keeps the value as is (assuming it's already between 0 and 1).
   - **Example 2:** Scales the floating-point value to a range of -1 to 1.
   - **Example 3:** Uses a threshold (0.5) to determine if the value is considered "legitimate" (1) or not (0).

2. **Method Signatures:**  The code strictly adheres to the required method signatures: `public static void main(String[])` and `public static float convert(float)`.

3. **Replace Example Logic:**  You *must* replace the example conversion logic in the `convert` method with your specific requirements for how you want to convert the floating-point value to a "legitimacy" value.


**How to Use:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `FloatingToLegitimacy.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and compile using `javac FloatingToLegitimacy.java`.
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code using `java FloatingToLegitimacy`.

The output will show the original floating-point value and the calculated "legitimacy" value based on the conversion logic you implement in the `convert` method.  Be sure to modify that method to match your specific definition of legitimacy.
