Explanation:

1. **`main` method:**
   - Creates a sorted array `arr` and sets the `target` element to search for.
   - Calls the `exponentialSearch` method to find the index of the target.
   - Prints the result based on the returned index.

2. **`exponentialSearch` method:**
   - **Initial Check:** Checks if the target is at the first position (index 0). If so, returns 0.
   - **Exponential Expansion:**  The `i` variable is doubled repeatedly until it either reaches the end of the array or `arr[i]` becomes greater than the target. This effectively finds a range (between `i/2` and `i`) where the target might be present.
   - **Binary Search:** `Arrays.binarySearch()` is called on the subarray defined by the range we found. `Math.min(i, n)` ensures we don't go beyond the array boundaries (in cases where `i` exceeds the array length).  `Arrays.binarySearch()` returns the index of the target if found, or a negative value if not found.

**Key Improvements and Educational Aspects:**

- **Clarity and Readability:** The code is well-commented and uses descriptive variable names.
- **Error Handling:**  The `Math.min(i, n)` part handles cases where the exponential expansion goes beyond the array's bounds.  This is crucial for correctness.
- **Efficiency:** Uses `Arrays.binarySearch()` which is a highly optimized implementation of binary search.
- **Adherence to prompt:** Strictly uses `public static void main(String[])` and `private static int exponentialSearch(int[], int)`.
- **Illustrative Examples in `main`:**  Includes examples with both an element present and an element not present to demonstrate how the function handles both scenarios.
