* **Clearer Output:** The `main` method now prints the radius, perimeter, and area with labels.


How to run the tests (assuming you have JUnit 5 set up):

1. Save the code as `CircleCalculations.java`.
2. Compile: `javac CircleCalculations.java`
3. Run the tests: `java -jar <path to junit-platform-console-standalone jar> -cp . -c CircleCalculationsTest` (Replace `<path...>` with the actual path)


This improved version is much more robust and demonstrates good coding practices.  The test cases ensure that the code behaves as expected under various conditions.
