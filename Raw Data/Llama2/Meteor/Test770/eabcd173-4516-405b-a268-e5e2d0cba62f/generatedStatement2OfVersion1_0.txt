Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Handles the Colon:**  Correctly extracts the second number even with the colon present in the input.
* **Error Handling:** Uses `try-catch` blocks to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the input string doesn't contain valid numbers. This prevents the program from crashing.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** Provides more informative error messages to the user if the input format is incorrect.
* **Generalized Solution:** Includes a second, more generalized approach that can handle more varied input formats, extracting numbers even if they are not separated by " h ".  It uses a regular expression to replace all non-digit characters with spaces.


This revised code is more robust and user-friendly.  It demonstrates good programming practices by handling errors and providing clear feedback to the user. It also offers a more flexible approach to handle a wider range of input scenarios.
