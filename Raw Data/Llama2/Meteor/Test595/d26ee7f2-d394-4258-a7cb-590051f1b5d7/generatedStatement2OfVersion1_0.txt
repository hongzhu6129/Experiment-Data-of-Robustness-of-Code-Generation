Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Regular Expression:** The regex is now more robust and easier to understand.  It breaks down as follows:
   - `^`: Matches the beginning of the string.
   - `(?:\\+\\d{1,3}[ ]?)?`:  Optional country code. `(?: ... )` is a non-capturing group.  `\\+` matches a literal '+'.  `\\d{1,3}` matches 1 to 3 digits.  `[ ]?` matches an optional space.
   - `\\(?`: Optional opening parenthesis.
   - `\\d{3}`: Matches 3 digits (area code).
   - `\\)?`: Optional closing parenthesis.
   - `[- ]?`: Optional hyphen or space.
   - `\\d{3}`: Matches 3 digits.
   - `[- ]?`: Optional hyphen or space.
   - `\\d{4}`: Matches 4 digits.
   - `$`: Matches the end of the string.


2. **Handles More Formats:** The improved regex supports phone numbers with or without parentheses, hyphens, and spaces, as well as optional country codes.

3. **Concise Code:** Using `Pattern` and `Matcher` provides a more standard and efficient way to perform regex matching in Java.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:**  Demonstrates how to call the `validate` method and displays the results for several test cases, including valid and invalid phone numbers.


This revised code is more flexible, reliable, and adheres to best practices for phone number validation in Java.  It also addresses potential issues like handling different separators and international numbers (with the country code option).
