**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Latitude 1 | Longitude 1 | Latitude 2 | Longitude 2 | Expected Distance (approx.) | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 25 | 35 | 35.5 | 25.5 | 1480.08 | Example from the prompt |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Same point |
| 3 | 90 | 0 | -90 | 0 |  20015.09 | North and South Poles |
| 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 180 | 20015.09 | Opposite sides of the equator |
| 5 | 40.7128 | -74.0060 | 34.0522 | -118.2437 | 3935.86 | New York to Los Angeles |
| 6 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 157.26 | Small distance |
| 7 | 90 | 0 | 89 | 180 | 157.46 | Near North Pole, opposite longitude |  // Corner case near pole, large longitude difference
| 8 | 0 | 179 | 0 | -179 | 222.64 | Near antimeridian |  // Corner case near 180/-180 longitude
| 9 | 89.99 | 0 | 89.99 | 1 | 1.11 | Very near the North Pole | // Corner case very near pole
| 10 | -90 | 0 | -89 | 0 | 111.19 | Near South Pole | // Corner case near pole
| 11 |  0 | 90 | 0 | -90 | 20015.09 | Opposite sides on the equator |




**Explanation of Corner Cases:**

* **Near Poles:** Calculations involving latitudes close to 90 or -90 degrees can be tricky due to the converging meridians.  Test cases 7 and 9 verify the behavior near the poles with varying longitude differences. Test case 10 is for the area near the south pole.

* **Near the Antimeridian (180/-180 Longitude):** Crossing the 180-degree meridian requires careful handling of longitude differences. Test case 8 tests this.

* **Same Point:** The distance between a point and itself should be zero (Test case 2).

* **Opposite Points on Equator:** Test case 4 and 11 checks the calculation for opposite points along the equator, resulting in half the earth's circumference as the distance.

**How to Run the Tests:**

You can manually input these values into the program or, for a more automated approach, create a separate test class using a testing framework like JUnit.  This will allow you to run the tests easily and verify the results against the expected values.  A JUnit example would look like this (partial example):
