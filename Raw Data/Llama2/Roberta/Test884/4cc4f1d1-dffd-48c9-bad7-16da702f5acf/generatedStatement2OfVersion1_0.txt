Key improvements:

- **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes explicit checks for `null` or empty input arrays.
- **Clearer Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than `k`.
- **Comprehensive Main Method:** Demonstrates usage with multiple test cases, including edge cases (empty and null arrays) and a case with no duplicates.
- **Output Clarity:** Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant portion of the modified array, avoiding displaying the unchanged trailing elements.  Also prints the actual length, as requested.
- **Conciseness and Readability:** Maintains a clear and efficient implementation without unnecessary complexity.  Uses pre-increment (`++uniqueIndex`) effectively.


This revised version adheres to the prompt's requirements for method signatures, addresses potential issues, and provides a more robust and demonstrable solution.
