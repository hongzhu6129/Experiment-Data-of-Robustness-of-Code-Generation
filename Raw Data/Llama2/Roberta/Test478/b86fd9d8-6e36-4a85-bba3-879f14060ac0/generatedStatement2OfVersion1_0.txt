**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Given Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Output: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -74
   - Expected Output: 0 km

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0 
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0  (Longitude doesn't matter at the poles)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)


4. **Antipodes (Opposite sides of Earth):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 106  (180 degrees opposite longitude)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)


5. **Points near the Prime Meridian/International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0.1  (Near Prime Meridian)
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: -179.9 (Near Date Line, just west) 
   - Expected Output: A small distance (because they are close despite longitude difference)

6. **Points near the Prime Meridian/International Date Line (other direction):**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: -0.1  (Near Prime Meridian)
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 179.9 (Near Date Line, just east) 
   - Expected Output: A small distance


7. **Invalid Input (Latitude out of range):**
    - lat1: 100 (or -100)  
    - Handle with an error message or exception.

8. **Invalid Input (Non-numeric input):**
    - Handle with an error message, exception handling, or input validation.


**How to Run Tests:**

You can either:

* **Manually test:** Enter the values into the console when prompted.
* **Create a testing framework:**  Use JUnit or TestNG to write automated tests. This is the preferred method for more comprehensive testing, especially if you plan to modify the code in the future.  You can create test methods with the sample input values and assert that the output matches the expected output with a given tolerance (due to floating-point calculations).
