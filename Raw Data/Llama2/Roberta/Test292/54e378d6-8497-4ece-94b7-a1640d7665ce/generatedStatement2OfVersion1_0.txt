Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Readability:** The code is now formatted more consistently and uses meaningful variable names, making it easier to understand.

2. **Efficiency Optimizations:**
   - Added `break` statements inside the inner loops to stop unnecessary calculations when the sum of cubes exceeds `n`.
   - Avoid duplicate pairs like (1,12) and (12,1) using `if (a <= b && c <=d)` condition

3. **Correctness:**
   - Ensures that the pairs of cubes are different using `if (a != c || b != d)`.
   -  Prints all the pairs that sum to the target number using another inner loop after finding `count >= 1`.


4. **Example Output (for n = 1729):**
