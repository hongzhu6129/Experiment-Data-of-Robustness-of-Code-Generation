Key improvements and explanations:

* **`java.time` API:**  Uses the modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8) which is much preferred over the older `Calendar` and `Date` classes. It's cleaner, easier to use, and thread-safe.
* **`YearMonth`:**  Uses the `YearMonth` class specifically designed for working with year and month combinations.  This is more direct than using `LocalDate` and manipulating the day.
* **`atDay(1)` and `atEndOfMonth()`:** These methods provide a concise way to get the first and last days of the month, respectively.
* **Formatting:** Includes date formatting using `DateTimeFormatter` to output the dates in a clear and readable format.
* **Error Handling (User Input Example):** The added user input example includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters non-integer values.
* **Clearer Comments:** Added more explanatory comments.
* **Handles User Input (Within `main`):** Demonstrates how to accept user input within the `main` method itself, fulfilling the prompt's specific requirement.
