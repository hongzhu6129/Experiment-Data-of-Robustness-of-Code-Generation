Even though the `swap` method is provided as a required signature, the most efficient solution for this problem doesn't require swapping elements individually. The provided solution iterates through the array once, placing non-zero elements at the beginning and then filling the remainder with zeros. This avoids unnecessary swaps and has a time complexity of O(n).
