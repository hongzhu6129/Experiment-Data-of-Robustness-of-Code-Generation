Key improvements in this code:

* **Efficiency:** The `swap` method now uses bitwise XOR for a more efficient in-place swap without a temporary variable. This reduces memory usage and can be slightly faster, especially for primitive types.  We also check if `i` and `j` are different to prevent an unnecessary self-swap, which, while not harmful, is a redundant operation.
* **Clarity:** The code is well-commented to explain the logic.
* **Correctness:**  The algorithm correctly moves all zeros to the end while preserving the order of the non-zero elements.
* **Adherence to Prompt:** The code strictly adheres to the specified method signatures.


The original algorithm was already conceptually correct in its approach of shifting non-zero elements to the left. This revised version builds on that foundation with optimizations and improved code style.
