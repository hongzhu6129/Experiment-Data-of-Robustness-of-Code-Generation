Key improvements and explanations:

* **Efficiency using `swap`:** The code now uses the provided `swap` method to efficiently exchange elements in the array. This avoids unnecessary assignments and improves performance, especially for larger arrays.  The previous solutions unnecessarily copied many elements repeatedly.
* **Clearer variable naming:**  `count` now clearly represents the count of non-zero elements, making the logic easier to understand.
* **Conciseness:** The logic is streamlined, making the code more readable and easier to follow.
* **Correct Output Formatting:** The `main` method now prints the output array in the required format [x, y, z,...].



This improved version directly addresses the prompt's requirements for method signatures and provides a more efficient and elegant solution. It leverages the `swap` method as instructed, resulting in cleaner and better performing code.
