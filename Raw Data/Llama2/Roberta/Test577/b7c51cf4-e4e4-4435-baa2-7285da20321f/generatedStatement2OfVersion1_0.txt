Explanation:

1. **`main` method:**
   - Takes input for the three sides of the triangle using a `Scanner`.
   - Calls `is_Valid` to check if the sides form a valid triangle.
   - If valid, calls `area_triangle` to calculate the area and prints the result.
   - If invalid, prints an error message.
   - Closes the `Scanner` to release resources.


2. **`is_Valid` method:**
   - Takes three `double` values as input (sides of the triangle).
   - Checks the triangle inequality theorem: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Also checks if all sides are positive.
   - Returns `true` if the triangle is valid, `false` otherwise.


3. **`area_triangle` method:**
   - Takes three `double` values as input (sides of the triangle).
   - Calculates the semi-perimeter `s`.
   - Uses Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle.
   - Returns the calculated area as a `double`.



Improvements in this version:

* **Input validation:** The `is_Valid` method now also checks for positive side lengths, preventing potential issues with negative or zero inputs.
* **Error handling:** The `main` method now prints a clear error message if the input sides do not form a valid triangle.
* **Resource management:** The `Scanner` is now closed after use to prevent resource leaks. 
* **Clearer variable names:** Uses more descriptive variable names like `a`, `b`, `c` for sides and `s` for semi-perimeter.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the purpose of different parts of the code.
