Key improvements:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes `try-catch` blocks to handle `NumberFormatException`, which occurs if the string cannot be parsed to a number (e.g., contains letters).  This prevents program crashes.
* **Example with Long:**  A `long` conversion is added.  A valid long string is used, and there's a demonstration of parsing only *part* of a string that might exceed the maximum long value.
* **Invalid String Handling:** Demonstrates how to handle cases where the string is clearly invalid (like "abc" or a number exceeding the limits).
* **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted nicely to show the type of each converted value.
* **Comments:** Comments explain important parts of the code.


This revised version is more robust and practical because it addresses potential errors and shows how to deal with various scenarios.
