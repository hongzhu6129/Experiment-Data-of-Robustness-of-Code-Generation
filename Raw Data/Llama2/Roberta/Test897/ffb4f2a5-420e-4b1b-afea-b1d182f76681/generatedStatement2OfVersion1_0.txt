**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:**  The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that might occur if the file is not found or there are other reading issues. It prints an error message and returns `null` to signal a problem.
2. **Whitespace Trimming:** The `.trim()` method is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace from each line read from the file. This ensures that extra spaces don't become part of the array elements.
3. **Dynamic Array Sizing:** The `ArrayList` is used as an intermediary to store the lines. This allows the array to grow dynamically as the file is read.  The final conversion to a `String[]` is done using `shoppingList.toArray(new String[0])`, which creates an array of the correct size.
4. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly labels the printed array as the "Shopping List Array."
5. **Helper Method:** The file reading and array creation logic is encapsulated in a separate private helper method (`readShoppingListToArray`). This improves code organization and readability.



**To use this code:**

1. **Create a text file** named `shopping_list.txt` (or whatever you choose as the `filePath`) in the same directory as your Java file.
2. **Add your shopping list items** to the file, each item on a separate line.
3. **Compile and run** the Java program.  The output will be the shopping list items in an array format.
