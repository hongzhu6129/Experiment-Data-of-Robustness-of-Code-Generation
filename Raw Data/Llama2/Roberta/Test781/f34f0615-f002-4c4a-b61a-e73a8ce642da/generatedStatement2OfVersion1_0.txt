**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` input, returning 0 in both cases.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** `newLength` is used instead of just `i` or `j` to make the purpose of the variable more obvious.

3. **In-Place Modification:** The function modifies the original array `nums` directly as requested.  The unique elements are placed at the beginning of the array.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method now includes a more complete set of test cases, covering empty arrays, null input, single-element arrays, and more complex examples. It also prints the modified array (up to the new length) for better verification.

5. **Efficient Approach:**  The algorithm uses a single loop, making it an efficient O(n) solution.

6. **Comments:**  Comments are included to explain the logic and the purpose of the different parts of the code.

7. **Use of `Arrays.copyOfRange`:** In the `main` method, `Arrays.copyOfRange` is used to print only the relevant part of the modified array (up to the `newLength`), preventing the display of the unmodified, "garbage" values that might be present after the `newLength` index.
