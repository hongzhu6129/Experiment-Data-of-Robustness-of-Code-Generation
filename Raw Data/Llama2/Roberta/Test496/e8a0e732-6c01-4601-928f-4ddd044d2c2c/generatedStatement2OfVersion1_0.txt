**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Recursion:** The core of the solution is recursion.  `multiply_two_nums` calls itself with a decreasing value of `b` until the base case (`b == 0`) is reached.

2. **Handling Negative Numbers:** The code explicitly handles negative values of `b` by negating the result of the recursive call.  This ensures correct multiplication for all combinations of positive and negative inputs.

3. **Base Case:** The base case `b == 0` stops the recursion and returns 0, which is essential to prevent infinite recursion.

4. **Clearer Naming:** Using `metastasize` was a bit unusual for multiplication. I've updated the comments to reflect the intent while using the specified method name. The example in `main` clarifies this as well.

5. **Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method now includes test cases with positive, negative, and zero values to demonstrate the correctness of the implementation.


This improved version addresses the previous issues of potential stack overflow, incorrect handling of negative numbers, and lack of clarity. It now provides a robust and correct solution within the given constraints.
