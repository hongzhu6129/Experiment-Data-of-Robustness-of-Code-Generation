**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 3. Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2 | 0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | Division by zero | Modulo by zero |  *(Corner Case)*
| 6. Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000 | 2 | 0 |
| 7. Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13 | 8 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0 |
| 8.  Mixed number types| 10 | 2.5 | 12.5 | 7.5 | 25 | 4 | 0 |
| 9. Negative Decimal Numbers | -10.5 | 2.5 | -8 | -13 | -26.25 | -4.2 | 0 |



**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You could either:

1. **Manual Testing:**  Input these values into the program one by one and verify the output against the expected values.

2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):** Use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a basic example of how you might write a JUnit test for this program (requires adding JUnit to your project):
