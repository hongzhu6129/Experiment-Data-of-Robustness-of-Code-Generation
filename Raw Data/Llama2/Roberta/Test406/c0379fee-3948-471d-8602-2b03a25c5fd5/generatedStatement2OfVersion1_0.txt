**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 3. Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2 | 0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | Division by zero | N/A |
| 6. Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13 | 8 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0 |
| 7. Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000 | 2 | 0 |
| 8. Small Numbers | 0.001 | 0.002 | 0.003 | -0.001 | 0.000002 | 0.5 | 0 |
| 9. Integer Division | 10 | 3 | 13 | 7 | 30 | 3.333... | 1 |  // Demonstrates remainder
| 10.  Negative and Zero | -5 | 0 | -5 | -5 | 0 | Division by zero | N/A |


**How to Run the Tests:**

While you could manually input these values into the program, a better approach is to automate the testing process. You could create a separate Java class with test methods using a testing framework like JUnit. This would allow you to run the tests automatically and verify the results against your expected values.



Example using JUnit (requires adding JUnit library to your project):
