**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 3. Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2 | 0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | Division by zero error | N/A |
| 6. Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000 | 2 | 0 |
| 7. Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13.0 | 8.0 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0 |
| 8.  Integer and Decimal| 10 | 2.5 | 12.5 | 7.5 | 25 | 4 | 0 |
| 9.  Modulo with negative numbers | -10 | 3 | -7 | -13 | -30 | -3.333... | -1 |



**How to run the test cases:**

1.  **Manual Testing:**  You can run the program multiple times, entering the values for `num1` and `num2` from the test case table.  Compare the output of the program with the expected values.

2.  **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  A more robust approach is to use JUnit (or a similar testing framework). Create a separate test class and write test methods for each test case.  Here's a basic example using JUnit:
