**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 3. Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2 | 0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | Division by zero | Remainder by zero |
| 6. Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000 | 2 | 0 |
| 7. Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13 | 8 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0 |
| 8. Integer and Decimal | 10 | 2.5 | 12.5 | 7.5 | 25 | 4 | 0 |
| 9.  Negative Decimal Numbers| -5.2 | 2.1 | -3.1 | -7.3 | -10.92 | -2.476... (approx) | ... (remainder handling for floating-point can be complex) |
| 10. Zero and Negative | 0 | -5 | -5 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |




**How to Run the Tests:**

You can manually enter these test cases into the program or, even better, create automated tests using a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a very basic example of how you might start with JUnit (you'll need to add the JUnit library to your project):
