Key improvements and explanations:

* **Handles edge cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` input.
* **Clearer variable names:**  `uniqueIndex`  more clearly represents the purpose of the variable.
* **Improved comments:** The Javadoc comment for  `removeDuplicates` is more descriptive.
* **Comprehensive test cases:** The  `main` method includes various test cases, including empty, null, and already unique arrays, demonstrating the robustness of the solution.
* **Prints only the relevant part of the array:** The use of `Arrays.copyOfRange` ensures that only the updated part of the array (up to the new length) is printed, preventing the display of any leftover elements from the original array.


This version adheres strictly to the specified method signatures while providing a more complete and robust solution to the problem.
