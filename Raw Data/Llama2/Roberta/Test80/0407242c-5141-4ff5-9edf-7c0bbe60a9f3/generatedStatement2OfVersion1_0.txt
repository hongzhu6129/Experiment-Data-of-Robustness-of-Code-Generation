Explanation and improvements:

1. **Command-Line Arguments:** The program now takes two command-line arguments: the directory path and a comma-separated list of extensions. This makes it more flexible.

2. **Error Handling:** It checks if the directory path is valid and handles the case where no matching files are found.

3. **Case-Insensitive Matching:** The `accept` method performs a case-insensitive comparison of file extensions (e.g., ".txt" and ".TXT" are considered the same).

4. **Trimming Extensions:**  The extensions are trimmed to remove any leading or trailing whitespace that might have been accidentally included in the input.

5. **Lambda Expression (Java 8+):**  A lambda expression is used with the `FilenameFilter` to make the code more concise.  If you are using an older version of Java, you can create a separate class that implements `FilenameFilter`.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `GetSpecificFiles.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac GetSpecificFiles.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with the directory path and extensions as arguments:
