Explanation:

1. **Create a LinkedList:**  A `LinkedList` of Strings is created and populated with some sample data.

2. **Check for Empty List:** We first check if the list is empty using `isEmpty()`.  If it is, we print a message and exit the program using `return`.  This is crucial to avoid `NoSuchElementException` if you try to access an element from an empty list.

3. **Method 1: `peekLast()`:**  The `peekLast()` method retrieves the last element of the `LinkedList` *without* removing it.

4. **Method 2: `get()`:** You can also get the last element using the `get()` method by providing the index. The last element's index is `size() - 1`.

5. **Print the List:** The code then prints the entire list to demonstrate that the last element has *not* been removed after using `peekLast()` or `get()`.


6. **Handling Empty Lists (Improved Example):**  The final example with the `numbers` list shows a more concise way to handle potentially empty lists using the ternary operator.  It avoids a separate `if` block by directly assigning `null` to `lastNumber` if the list is empty.


Key Improvements over a basic solution:

* **Handles empty lists:** Prevents runtime errors by checking for empty lists.
* **Clearly demonstrates non-destructive retrieval:** Shows that the last element is retrieved but not removed.
* **Provides multiple methods:** Shows `peekLast()` and `get()` for retrieving the last element.
* **Includes a more concise approach:** The `numbers` example demonstrates a streamlined way to deal with potential nulls from empty lists.
