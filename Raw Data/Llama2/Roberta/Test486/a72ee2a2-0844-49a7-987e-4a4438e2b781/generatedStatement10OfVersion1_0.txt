**Key Improvements:**

* **Input Validation:** The code now includes input validation to handle cases where the user provides invalid input (non-integer, negative numbers, or no arguments).  This makes the program more robust.
* **Clearer Output:** The output now displays the row and column indices within each cell of the matrix, making it easier to understand the structure of the matrix.
* **Error Handling:**  The `try-catch` block handles potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters a non-integer value for `n`.


This improved version addresses the prompt's requirements while also being more practical and user-friendly.
