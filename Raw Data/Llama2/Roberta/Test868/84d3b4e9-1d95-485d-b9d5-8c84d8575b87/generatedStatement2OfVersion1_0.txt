Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`makefactorial(int n)`:** Calculates the factorial of `n` efficiently.

2. **`calcuLexicoRank(String str, int n)`:**
   - Uses a `count` array to store character counts (more efficient than sorting or repeated iterations).
   - Implements the core logic of the lexicographic rank algorithm accurately, considering duplicate characters.
   - Handles ASCII characters correctly.

3. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - Includes example usages with different input strings to demonstrate the functionality.
   - Clearly prints the results for easy understanding.

4. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the code's logic and purpose.

5. **Clarity and Style:**  Improved variable names and formatting for better readability.


This revised version addresses the issues in the original code and provides a correct and efficient implementation for calculating the lexicographic rank of a string.
