This improved version includes:

* **Multiple examples:**  Demonstrates usage with different strings, including a case where the string *doesn't* end with the target.
* **Null and empty string handling:** Shows how to safely check if a null or empty string ends with another string, avoiding potential `NullPointerExceptions`.
* **Command-line arguments:**  Allows users to test their own strings by passing them as command-line arguments.  This makes the program more interactive and reusable.
* **Clearer output:**  The output is formatted to be more readable and informative, explicitly stating the strings being compared and the result.
