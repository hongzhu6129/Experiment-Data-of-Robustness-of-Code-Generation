This code fulfills the prompt's requirements in the following ways:

1. **Uses only `public static void main(String[] args)`:** The entire logic is contained within the main method.

2. **Prints Java environment information:** It retrieves and prints the Java version, runtime version, home directory, vendor, vendor URL, and classpath, mirroring the output in the problem description.

3. **Checks for Java installation:** Beyond just printing properties, it actively checks for a working JDK installation by attempting to execute `javac -version`. This is a more reliable indicator than simply checking system properties.  It also includes error handling for a more robust solution.


This improved version provides a more comprehensive and reliable way to determine if Java (specifically the JDK, which is needed for compiling Java programs) is installed and functioning correctly.
