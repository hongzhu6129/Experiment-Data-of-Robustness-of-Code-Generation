Key improvements in this educational example:

* **Clearer Explanations:**  Comments explain each method and important details.
* **Different Data Types:** Shows joining lists of Strings, Integers, and Doubles to illustrate generality.
* **addAll() Efficiency:**  Highlights the efficient `addAll()` method and creating a copy to prevent modification of the original list.
* **Iteration Method:** Shows the manual iteration approach for a deeper understanding of how joining works.
* **Streams Introduction (with limitations):**  Briefly introduces the Streams approach (Java 8+) while acknowledging its limitations within the `main` method constraint. This offers a glimpse into more advanced techniques.
* **Better Output Formatting:** Makes the output easier to read and understand.
