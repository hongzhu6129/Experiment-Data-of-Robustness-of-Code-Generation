Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:**  It now includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters dates in an incorrect format.  This makes the program more robust.
* **Clearer Output:**  The output is now labeled more clearly ("Difference:", "Years:", etc.) for better readability.
* **Standard Library:** It uses `java.time` (introduced in Java 8), which is the preferred way to work with dates and times in modern Java.  It's much cleaner and easier than older approaches (like `Date` and `Calendar`).
* **User Input:**  It takes date input from the user, making it more interactive.
