Key improvements in this version:

* **Uses `java.time`:** This modern Java date/time API is much preferred over the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes.  It's cleaner, easier to use, and handles date/time calculations correctly.
* **Input Validation:** The `try-catch` block handles `DateTimeParseException` to gracefully deal with incorrect date formats entered by the user.
* **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted more nicely, making it easier to read the difference in years, months, and days.
* **Closed Scanner:** The `scanner.close()` statement prevents resource leaks.
* **Handles Different Date Orders:** The `Period.between()` method correctly calculates the difference regardless of which date is earlier.
