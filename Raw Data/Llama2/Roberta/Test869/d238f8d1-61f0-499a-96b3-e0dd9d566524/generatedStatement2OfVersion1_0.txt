**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Null and Empty:** The code now explicitly handles `null` and empty (or all-whitespace) sentences by returning an empty string. This is important for robustness.

2. **Trimming Whitespace:**  The `trim()` method removes leading and trailing whitespace from the input sentence.  This prevents incorrect splitting due to extra spaces at the beginning or end.

3. **Splitting by Whitespace:**  The `split("\\s+")` method splits the sentence by one or more whitespace characters. This handles cases where there are multiple spaces between words.

4. **Handles Sentences with Fewer Than Two Words:** The code checks if the array of words has at least two elements. If not (e.g., a single-word sentence or an empty sentence after trimming), it returns an empty string.

5. **Clearer Test Cases:** The test cases are now more organized, including corner cases and showing the expected output for each.  The `main` method now iterates through the test cases and clearly indicates whether each test passed or failed.



**Key Corner Cases Covered:**

* **Null sentence:**  `null`
* **Empty sentence:** `""`
* **Whitespace-only sentence:** `"  "`
* **Single-word sentence:** `"SingleWord"`
* **Sentences with leading/trailing spaces:** `"  Leading and trailing spaces  "`
* **Sentences with multiple spaces between words:** `"  multiple   spaces between  "`



This improved version is more robust and handles a wider range of input scenarios correctly. The comprehensive test cases ensure that the function works as expected under various conditions.
