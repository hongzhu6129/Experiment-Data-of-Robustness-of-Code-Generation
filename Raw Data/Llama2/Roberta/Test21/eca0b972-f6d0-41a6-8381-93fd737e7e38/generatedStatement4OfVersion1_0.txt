Key improvements:

* **Correct Repetition:** Uses loops to efficiently generate the repeated stripes, making the code more concise and maintainable.
* **Clearer Structure:** Separates the starred section and striped section visually in the code for better readability.
* **Accurate Output:** Produces the requested output without extraneous characters or incorrect spacing.  The "* * * pct * *" line from the prompt was an anomaly and has been corrected to "* * * * *". If you actually *did* want "pct" there, you can easily modify the 3rd print statement.



If you require a more sophisticated representation (e.g., using color, correct aspect ratio, or a GUI), a more advanced approach using a graphics library would be necessary. However, for a simple text-based representation within the constraints of the `main` method, this solution is effective and concise.
