Key improvements and explanations for this code:

* **Correct Alignment:** The original code had alignment issues due to inconsistencies in the lengths of the star and stripe sections.  This version uses consistent lengths (34 for the stripes in the star section and 46 for the full-width stripes) to create the proper flag appearance.
* **Spacing:** The spacing between the stars and stripes in the star rows is adjusted to two spaces to look more like a standard flag.
* **Simplified Logic:**  The code is now more concise and easier to read by using consistent loop structures.
* **Output Accuracy:** The output now accurately represents a typical American flag representation in text form, with the correct proportions and spacing.


To compile and run this code:

1. Save it as `AmericanFlag.java`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Compile: `javac AmericanFlag.java`
5. Run: `java AmericanFlag`


This will print the American flag pattern to the console.
