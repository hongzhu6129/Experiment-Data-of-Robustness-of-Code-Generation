**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **Node Class:** Represents a node in the binary tree.  Each node holds data and references to its left and right children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node) Method:**
   - **Base Case:** If the current node `node` is `null` (empty), the depth is 0. This stops the recursion.
   - **Recursive Calls:**  The `maxDepth` method is called recursively for the left subtree (`node.left`) and the right subtree (`node.right`).
   - **Maximum Depth Calculation:** The maximum depth of the current subtree is the maximum of the depths of its left and right subtrees, plus 1 (to account for the current node itself).

3. **main(String[] args) Method:**
   - **Tree Construction:** Demonstrates how to create a sample binary tree.
   - **Method Call and Output:** Shows how to call the `maxDepth` method and print the result.  Includes examples with different tree structures (a regular tree, a single-node tree, and an empty tree) to illustrate how the code handles various cases.


**How Recursion Works:**

The `maxDepth` method uses recursion to traverse the tree.  Imagine it like exploring branches:
- You start at the root.
- You explore the left branch (calling `maxDepth` on the left child).
- You explore the right branch (calling `maxDepth` on the right child).
- The depth of the current node is 1 + the maximum depth found in the left or right branches.


**Key Concepts:**

- **Recursion:** A technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.
- **Base Case:** The condition that stops the recursion.  Without a base case, recursion would continue infinitely.
- **Tree Traversal:**  Exploring the nodes of a tree in a systematic way.  The `maxDepth` method uses a type of depth-first traversal.
