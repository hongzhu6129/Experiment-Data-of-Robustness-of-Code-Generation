Although the `swap` method was provided as a required signature,  it's more efficient to directly shift the non-zero elements to the front of the array rather than using swaps in this specific "move zeros to the end" problem. This avoids unnecessary swapping operations and improves performance, especially for larger arrays. Therefore, the provided solution does not utilize the `swap` method.
