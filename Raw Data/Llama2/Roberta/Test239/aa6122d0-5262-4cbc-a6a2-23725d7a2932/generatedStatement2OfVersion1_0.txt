Key improvements in this version:

* **Efficiency:** The `swap` function now uses XOR swap and avoids unnecessary self-swapping if `i` and `j` are the same. This makes the swapping slightly more efficient, especially if there are many duplicate elements in the array or many zeros close together.
* **Clarity:** Comments are added to explain the logic and the purpose of the `count` variable.
* **Correctness:** The main method now correctly prints the resulting array.


How it works:

1. **`move_zero(int[] arr)`:**
   - Initializes `count` to 0.  `count` keeps track of the index where the next non-zero element should be placed.
   - Iterates through the array.
   - If a non-zero element is found, it's swapped with the element at the `count` index.  This effectively moves all non-zero elements to the front of the array.
   - `count` is incremented to prepare for the next non-zero element.

2. **`swap(int[] arr, int i, int j)`:**
   - Swaps the elements at indices `i` and `j` in the array using the XOR swap algorithm.  This avoids the need for a temporary variable, making the swap slightly more efficient. It also avoids unnecessary self-swapping.

3. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - Creates a sample array.
   - Calls `move_zero` to move the zeros to the right.
   - Prints the modified array.
