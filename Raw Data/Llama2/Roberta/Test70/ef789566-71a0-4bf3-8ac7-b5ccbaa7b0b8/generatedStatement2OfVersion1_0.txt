Key Improvements and Explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueIndex` makes the code easier to understand.
2. **Concise Conditional:** The `if` condition directly checks for duplicates without an unnecessary nested `else`.
3. **Return Value:** The function correctly returns the new length (`uniqueIndex + 1`).
4. **Comprehensive `main` Method:**  The `main` method now demonstrates how to use `removeDuplicates` and prints the updated array along with the new length.  Crucially, I've added examples showing how to correctly print the relevant part of the modified array using `Arrays.copyOfRange`. This prevents displaying the original, larger array with trailing garbage values.
5. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now gracefully handles empty (`{}`) and `null` input arrays, ensuring robust behavior. This is important in real-world applications.


This improved version is more efficient, readable, and robust, and demonstrates how to properly use the function and display the results.
