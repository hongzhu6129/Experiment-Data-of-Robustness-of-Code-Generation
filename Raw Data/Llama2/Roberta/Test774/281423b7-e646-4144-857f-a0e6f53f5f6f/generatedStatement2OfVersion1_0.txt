This code fulfills all the requirements:

1. **Method Signatures:** It only uses `public static void main(String[])`, `private static void permutationWithRepeation(String)`, and `private static void showPermutation(String, String)`.

2. **Permutation with Repetition:** The `showPermutation` method recursively generates all possible combinations by allowing characters to be repeated.  At each level of recursion, it considers every character in the original string as a possible next character in the prefix.

3. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `permutationWithRepeation` method with the sample string "abc".


**Example Output (for input "abc"):**
