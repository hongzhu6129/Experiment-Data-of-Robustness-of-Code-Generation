Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Examples:**  The `main` method now demonstrates both `Period` (for date differences) and `Duration` (for time differences) with concrete examples and output formatting.
* **ISO 8601 Format for LocalDateTime:**  Uses `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME` to format `LocalDateTime` objects for consistent and clear output.  This is better than just using `toString()`.
* **Duration Component Access:** Shows how to access the hours, minutes, and seconds parts of a `Duration` using `toHours()`, `toMinutesPart()`, and `toSecondsPart()`.  This makes the code more practical.
* **`periodToYMD` Method:**  Provides a cleaner way to format the `Period` output.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the code's purpose and usage.


This revised code demonstrates both `Period` and `Duration` effectively and provides a more robust and understandable example.
