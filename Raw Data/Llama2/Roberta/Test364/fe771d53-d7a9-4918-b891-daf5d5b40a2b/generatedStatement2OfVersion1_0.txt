This educational example demonstrates:

1. **Creating a TreeSet:** Shows how to initialize a `TreeSet` of both `Integer` and `String` types.  
2. **`floor()` method:** Explains the core concept of finding the greatest element less than or equal to the given element.
3. **Handling different scenarios:** Includes examples where the element is present, not present but a smaller element exists, and where the element is smaller than all elements in the set.
4. **Null handling:**  Demonstrates that `floor()` returns `null` if there's no element less than or equal to the given element.
5. **Different Data Types:** Shows how `floor()` works with `String` objects, emphasizing the natural ordering.
6. **Comparison with `lower()`:**  Clearly explains the distinction between `floor()` (less than or equal to) and `lower()` (strictly less than) with an example.


This comprehensive `main` method provides a clear and concise tutorial on using `TreeSet.floor()` in Java.
