This JUnit example provides a more robust and automated way to test the `calculateAverage` method. Remember to include the JUnit library in your project.  The `assertEquals` method checks if the actual output matches the expected output. The delta in the last test is used because of potential floating-point precision issues when working with very small numbers. Using a testing framework like JUnit is highly recommended for any serious Java project.
