To compile and run this from the command line:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StringConcatenation.java`
2. **Compile:** `javac StringConcatenation.java`
3. **Run:**  `java StringConcatenation "First String" "Second String"` (replace with your desired strings)


**Explanation using only main method:**

The provided code demonstrates string concatenation within the constraints of only using the `main` method. It showcases two primary methods:

* **Using the `+` operator:** This is the most straightforward approach. The `+` operator, when used with strings, performs concatenation.
* **Using the `concat()` method:** This method, available on string objects, appends the specified string to the end of the current string.

The code also includes an example of handling user input directly within the `main` method.  It uses `args`, the string array that holds command-line arguments.  It checks if two arguments are provided and concatenates them if available.  This provides basic user interaction within the limitations of the `main` method.
