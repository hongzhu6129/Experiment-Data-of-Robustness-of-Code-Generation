This enhanced educational example:

1. **Uses `System.nanoTime()`:**  This is the recommended way to measure execution time in nanoseconds in Java.
2. **Demonstrates a potential issue:** Shows how very short executions might report 0 nanoseconds and suggests running the code multiple times and averaging to address this.
3. **Includes `System.currentTimeMillis()`:** Provides a comparison with `currentTimeMillis()`, which measures in milliseconds and is less precise but can be useful for longer-running operations.  This highlights the difference in precision.
4. **Prints results:** Prints the results of the computations within the timed blocks. This prevents the compiler from optimizing away the code being measured, which could lead to artificially short execution times.
5. **Clearer explanations:** Includes comments to explain the purpose of each section and potential pitfalls.


This improved example offers a more comprehensive and practical understanding of timing code execution in Java.
