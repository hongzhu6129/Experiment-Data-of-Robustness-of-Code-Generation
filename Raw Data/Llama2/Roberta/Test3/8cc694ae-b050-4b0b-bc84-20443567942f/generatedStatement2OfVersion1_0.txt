This code uses a combination of loops and `System.out.print` and `System.out.println` to achieve the desired output.  It's a simplified representation of the flag, using "*" for the blue field and stars, and "=" for the red and white stripes. The output matches the structure specified in the problem description.  Since precise graphical representation is difficult in console output, this code provides a symbolic visualization.  The output will look slightly different from a real flag when viewing it due to character size differences.
