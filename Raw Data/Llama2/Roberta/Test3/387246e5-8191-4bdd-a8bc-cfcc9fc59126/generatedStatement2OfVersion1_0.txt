This revised code addresses the following:

* **Correct Star and Stripe Pattern:**  The stars and stripes are now printed in the correct alternating pattern for the US flag. Six rows have stars and stripes, and the remaining rows are just red stripes.
* **Consistent Spacing:** The spacing between the stars and the stripes is now consistent and creates a more uniform output. The offset for stripe-only rows is handled correctly.
* **Simplified Logic:** The code uses fewer loops and simpler conditional logic, making it easier to understand and maintain.
* **Clearer Output:** The output now more closely resembles a US flag, with the correct proportions and layout.
