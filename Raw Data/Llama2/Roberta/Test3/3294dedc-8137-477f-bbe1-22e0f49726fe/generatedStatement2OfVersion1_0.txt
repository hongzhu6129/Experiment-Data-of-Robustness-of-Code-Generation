Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Clearer Star Arrangement:** The logic for alternating star patterns on each row is improved, providing the correct offset.
* **Consistent Stripe Length:**  The stripes now maintain a consistent length throughout the flag. The nested loop for the stripes has been replaced by one `for` loop, which significantly improves readability.
* **Correct Proportions:**  The code now prints a flag with proportions closer to a real American flag (though still stylized for text output).
* **Simplified Code:** The code is made more concise and easier to understand by removing redundant or unnecessary parts.  


This version focuses on printing a *representation* of the American flag within the constraints of a text console. It uses `*` for stars and `=` for stripes.  A true graphical representation would require a different approach using a graphical library.
