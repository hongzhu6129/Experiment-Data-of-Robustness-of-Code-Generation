Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Pivot Selection:** Using `array[lowerIndex + (higherIndex - lowerIndex) / 2]`  avoids potential integer overflow when calculating the middle index.
* **Recursive Calls:**  The recursive calls to `quickSort` are correctly placed *after* the partitioning step.
* **Concise Swapping:** The `exchangeNumbers` method is efficient and easy to understand.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes a check for null or empty input array in the `sort` method.
* **Example Usage in `main`:** Demonstrates how to use the `QuickSort` class and prints the sorted array.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic, especially the partitioning process.


This improved version adheres to the requested method signatures, is more robust, and follows best practices for implementing QuickSort in Java.
