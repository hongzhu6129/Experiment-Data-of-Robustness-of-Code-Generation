Key improvements and explanations in this revised version:

* **Handles Empty Set:** The code now checks if the set is empty before attempting to remove an element.  This prevents `NullPointerExceptions`.
* **Clarification on Set Order:**  Regular `HashSet`s don't guarantee any specific order. The code explains this and provides a solution using `LinkedHashSet` if insertion order is important.
* **Iterating to Get an Element:** Since sets are unordered (in general), the code iterates through the `HashSet` to get *one* element, which it then removes.  It is not the "last" in the sense of most recently added, unless you use `LinkedHashSet`.
* **`LinkedHashSet` Example:** The code now shows how to use a `LinkedHashSet` to preserve insertion order, correctly retrieving and removing the *truly* last added element.  This makes the code more useful for cases where order matters.
* **Clear Output:** The output now clearly indicates whether the "last" element is from a regular `HashSet` (where order is not guaranteed) or from a `LinkedHashSet`.
