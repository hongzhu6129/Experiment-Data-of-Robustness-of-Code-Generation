Key improvements and explanations in this educational example:

1. **Clearer Examples:**  Uses multiple examples with different keys and even a different key data type (String) to demonstrate how `lowerKey()` works in various situations.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes cases where the target key is greater than all keys in the map, equal to a key in the map, and less than the smallest key (demonstrating the `null` return).

3. **Explanatory Comments:**  Comments throughout the code explain what's happening at each step, making it easier to understand.

4. **Null Handling:** Shows best practice for handling potential `null` return values using an `if` statement to prevent `NullPointerExceptions`.

5. **Output Clarity:**  The output clearly indicates the target key and the result of `lowerKey()`, making it easy to follow the examples.

6. **TreeMap Introduction:** Briefly explains that `TreeMap` is the appropriate data structure for this operation because it maintains sorted order.


This revised version provides a more comprehensive and educational demonstration of how to get the greatest key strictly less than a given key in a Java `TreeMap`.
