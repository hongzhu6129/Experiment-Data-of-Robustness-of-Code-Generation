Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  It now includes checks for an empty input array and invalid values of `k` (e.g., `k <= 0` or `k` greater than the array size). It provides appropriate messages in these cases.

- **Clearer output:** The output now clearly indicates the value of `k` and prints a user-friendly message if the input is invalid.

- **More efficient sorting (optional):** If you need the `k` largest elements in descending order, the code uses `Arrays.sort()` with a custom comparator on the `Integer[]` array after retrieving the elements from the `PriorityQueue`. This is typically more efficient than sorting the original `int[]` array.


This improved version provides more robust and user-friendly behavior.
