Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** Added a check to ensure `k` is valid (not negative or greater than the array length).
2. **Min-Heap Approach:** Uses a `PriorityQueue` (min-heap) which provides an efficient way to store the k largest elements seen so far. This is generally the most efficient method for this problem (time complexity O(N log k)).
3. **Sorting Approach:** Includes an alternative method using sorting. While simpler, it has a higher time complexity of O(N log N), making the min-heap approach preferred for larger datasets.
4. **Clear Output:** Prints clear labels to distinguish between the different methods used.
5. **Optional Sorting:** Includes the option to sort the `kLargestArray` obtained from the min-heap before printing if an ordered output is needed.   If order doesn't matter, you can skip the `Arrays.sort` on the `kLargestArray` and iterate through the `minHeap` directly using a while loop:
