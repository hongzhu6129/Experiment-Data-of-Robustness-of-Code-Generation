Explanation using only `main`:

1. **Create a `PriorityQueue`:** `PriorityQueue<String> colorQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();` creates a priority queue to store strings (representing colors).  By default, strings are ordered lexicographically (alphabetically) in a `PriorityQueue`.

2. **Add colors:** `colorQueue.offer("Red");` etc. adds colors to the queue. `offer()` inserts elements according to the queue's priority order.

3. **Print elements:**
   - **Method 1 (Iterate and Remove):** The commented-out `while` loop using `colorQueue.poll()` retrieves and removes the head (the lowest-priority element according to the natural ordering of Strings) of the queue in each iteration until the queue is empty. This empties the queue after printing.
   - **Method 2 (Iterate without Removing - preferred):**  The `for (String color : colorQueue)` loop (enhanced for loop) iterates through the queue without modifying it.  This approach lets you print the elements while preserving the queue's contents.
   - **Method 3 (Iterator):**  The commented-out iterator approach gives you explicit control over the iteration and also preserves the queue.


Key improvement from earlier responses:

- **Preserving the queue:** The preferred method now uses an enhanced `for` loop or iterator, so the queue's contents are not removed when printing. This is generally more useful than emptying the queue during printing.
- **Clearer explanation:**  The explanations are more concise and directly relate to the code in the `main` method.
- **Standard output:** The output is sent to the console using `System.out.println()`, the standard Java way to print.
