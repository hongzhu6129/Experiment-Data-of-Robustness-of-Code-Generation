**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Node Class:** Defines the structure of a node in the ternary tree. Each node has data and pointers to left, middle, and right children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):** 
   - This recursive method calculates the maximum depth.
   - **Base Case:** If the node is null (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  It recursively calculates the depth of the left, middle, and right subtrees. Then, it returns the maximum of these depths + 1 (to account for the current node).

3. **main() Method:**
   - Creates instances of the `TernaryTreeMaxDepth` class and `Node` objects to build example ternary trees.
   - Calls the `maxDepth()` method to calculate and print the maximum depth of the created trees.
   - Added additional test cases (empty tree, single node tree) to demonstrate the correctness of the `maxDepth()` method in different scenarios.


**Key Improvements over simpler solutions:**

- **Handles Null Nodes:** The base case `if (node == null)` correctly handles empty trees or subtrees, preventing `NullPointerExceptions`.
- **Clearer Recursive Logic:** The use of `Math.max()` simplifies the comparison of depths and makes the code more readable.
- **Demonstrates Ternary Structure:** The examples in `main()` now show how to create and work with true ternary trees (nodes having potentially three children).
- **Thorough Testing:** The inclusion of multiple test cases helps verify the function's correctness in various scenarios.


This improved code provides a robust and clear solution to finding the maximum depth of a ternary tree in Java.
