Explanation:

1. **`allInterleavings(String str1, String str2, String current, Set<String> result)`:**
   - This recursive method generates all possible interleavings.
   - `str1` and `str2` are the input strings.
   - `current` stores the interleaving being built.
   - `result` is a Set to store unique interleavings (avoiding duplicates if input strings have repeated characters).

2. **Base Case:**
   - If both `str1` and `str2` are empty, it means we've formed a complete interleaving.  Add the `current` string to the `result` set.

3. **Recursive Steps:**
   - If `str1` is not empty, take the first character from `str1`, append it to `current`, and recursively call `allInterleavings` with the remaining part of `str1`.
   - If `str2` is not empty, do the same, taking the first character from `str2`.

4. **`main` Method:**
   - Sets example input strings `str1` and `str2`.
   - Creates a `HashSet` called `interleavings` to store the results.
   - Calls `allInterleavings` to start the recursive process.
   - Prints the generated interleavings.
