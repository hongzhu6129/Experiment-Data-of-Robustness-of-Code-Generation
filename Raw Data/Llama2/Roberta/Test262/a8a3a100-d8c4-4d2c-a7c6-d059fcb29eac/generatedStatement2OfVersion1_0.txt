**Explanation and Improvement:**

1. **`main` method:**
   - Iterates from 2 to 99 (inclusive) as we are looking for primes less than 100.
   - Calls `is_Prime` to check if the current number is prime.
   - Calls `isTurboprop` to check if the number meets the "turboprop" criteria (which, as explained, is assumed to be the same as being prime in this context).
   - Prints the prime turboprop numbers.

2. **`is_Prime` method:**
   - Efficiently checks if a number `n` is prime by iterating only up to the square root of `n`.
   - Handles base cases: returns `false` for numbers less than or equal to 1.

3. **`isTurboprop` Method:**
   - Since there's no clear definition of a "turboprop number",  and the expected output from earlier solutions suggests that it's the same as a prime number in this particular problem, the `isTurboprop` function simply calls `is_Prime`.  If a different definition of "turboprop" is intended, you would modify this function accordingly.

4. **Clarity and Formatting:**
   - Added comments for better understanding.
   - Improved formatting with a newline at the end for better output presentation.


This code directly addresses the prompt's requirements using only the specified method signatures, efficiently finds primes, and provides a clear structure for future modifications if the definition of "turboprop" changes.
