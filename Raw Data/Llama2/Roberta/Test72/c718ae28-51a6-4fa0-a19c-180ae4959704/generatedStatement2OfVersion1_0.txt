Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code explicitly handles `null` and empty input arrays.  This is crucial for robust code.

2. **Clear Variable Names:** Using names like `uniqueIndex` instead of just `i` or `j` significantly improves readability.

3. **Concise Logic:** The core logic within the loop is very clear and efficient.  It only performs the assignment when a unique element is found.

4. **Correct Return Value:** The function correctly returns `uniqueIndex + 1` because `uniqueIndex` represents the index of the last unique element, and the length is one greater than the index.

5. **Comprehensive Main Method:** The `main` method now includes multiple test cases, including empty and `null` input, demonstrating how the function handles these scenarios.  The output also shows the actual updated array (up to the new length) using `Arrays.copyOfRange`, making it easier to verify the results.


This improved version is more readable, robust, and easier to understand. It also provides better testing in the `main` method to ensure correctness.
