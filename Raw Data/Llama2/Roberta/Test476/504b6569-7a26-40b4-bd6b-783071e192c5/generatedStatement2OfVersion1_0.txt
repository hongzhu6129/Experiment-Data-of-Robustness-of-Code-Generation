Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays and null input.
* **Clearer variable naming:**  `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `k`.
* **Comprehensive main method:** Includes more test cases, including empty and null arrays, demonstrating the robustness of the `removeDuplicates` method.  It also prints the updated array contents (up to the new length) using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid displaying the unmodified portion of the original array.
* **Concise and efficient:** The core logic remains efficient and uses minimal extra memory (O(1)).
* **Documented:** Includes a JavaDoc comment explaining the function's purpose and parameters.


This improved version is more robust, readable, and demonstrates the correct behavior with different input scenarios.
