Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `uniqueIndex` instead of just `i` or `j` for the index tracking unique elements improves readability.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty and null input arrays.

3. **Concise Logic:**  The core logic of comparing elements and updating the `uniqueIndex` is efficient and straightforward.

4. **Informative Output:** The `main` method now includes more test cases and prints both the updated length and the relevant part of the modified array using `Arrays.copyOfRange`. This helps visualize the changes made by `removeDuplicates`.

5. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the purpose of variables and sections of code.


This revised code provides a more robust, readable, and well-tested solution to the remove duplicates problem while adhering to the specified method signatures.
