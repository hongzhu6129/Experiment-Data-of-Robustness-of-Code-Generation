Key Improvements and Explanations:

* **`NavigableMap`:** The code uses `NavigableMap` instead of just `SortedMap`.  `NavigableMap` provides methods like `subMap()` which are essential for this task and offer more flexibility.
* **Clearer Examples:**  The code includes both Integer and String key examples to demonstrate broader applicability.
* **Inclusive Submap:**  The `subMap()` method takes four arguments: `fromKey`, `fromInclusive`, `toKey`, and `toInclusive`. Setting the inclusive flags to `true` ensures the start and end keys are included in the submap.
* **Error Handling:** The code now includes error handling to demonstrate how to deal with cases where the start or end keys might not be in the map, or where the `startKey` is greater than the `endKey`. This prevents unexpected `IllegalArgumentException`s.
* **Comments:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each section.


How to Compile and Run:

1. Save the code as `SubMapExample.java`.
2. Compile: `javac SubMapExample.java`
3. Run: `java SubMapExample`
