**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Uses `NavigableMap`:**  The `subMap()` method is available for `NavigableMap` implementations (like `TreeMap`). This is essential for getting a portion of a map based on key ranges.
* **Clearer Example:**  The code now includes a simple example with integer keys and string values, making it easier to understand.
* **Inclusive Submap:** Demonstrates how to create a submap that *includes* both the `fromKey` and `toKey` using `subMap(fromKey, true, toKey, true)`.
* **String Key Example:** Added an example using String keys to show the versatility of `NavigableMap`.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the code's functionality.
* **Output:** Shows the original map and the extracted submap for clarity.


This improved version provides a complete and easy-to-understand solution to the problem within the constraints of using only the `main` method.  It effectively demonstrates how to get a portion of a `TreeMap` (or any `NavigableMap`) based on a key range.
