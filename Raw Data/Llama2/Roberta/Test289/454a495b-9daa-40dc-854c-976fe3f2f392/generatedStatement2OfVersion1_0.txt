**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **User Input:** The code now takes both the string and the character to search for as input from the user using the `Scanner` class. This makes it more interactive and flexible.

2. **Character Counting Logic:** The core logic remains the same, iterating through the string and incrementing the `count` whenever the target character is found.

3. **Clear Output:**  The output message is more descriptive, clearly indicating the character being counted and its total occurrences.

4. **Execution Time Measurement:**  The code now accurately measures and displays the execution time of the character counting process using `System.nanoTime()`. This helps to assess the efficiency of the code, especially for larger strings.

5. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` after its use to prevent resource leaks. This is a good practice when working with I/O resources.

**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CountCharacterOccurrences.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac CountCharacterOccurrences.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code: `java CountCharacterOccurrences`

The program will prompt you to enter the string and the character, and then it will display the number of occurrences and the execution time.
