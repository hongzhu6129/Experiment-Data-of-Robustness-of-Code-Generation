Key Improvements and Explanations:

* **Testability:** The code is now more easily testable. The calculations are separated from the printing, so we can test the logic without needing to capture console output.
* **JUnit Tests:** The test cases use JUnit 5, a standard Java testing framework. This provides a structured way to write and run tests.
* **Corner Cases:**  The test cases cover important corner cases, such as a radius of 0, a large radius, a very small radius, and a negative radius (demonstrating how to handle an invalid input by using Assertions.assertThrows).
* **Double Comparisons:**  When comparing floating-point numbers (doubles), we use `assertEquals(expected, actual, delta)` to account for tiny rounding errors. The `delta` is the allowed difference between the expected and actual values.  The size of the necessary `delta` might need adjusting depending on the magnitude of the expected value.
* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is formatted consistently and includes comments to explain the purpose of different sections.
