Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles empty and single-element arrays:**  Added checks to correctly handle these edge cases.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` makes the purpose of the variable more obvious.
- **Comprehensive test cases:** Added more test cases in `main` to demonstrate correct behavior with different inputs, including empty and single-element arrays.
- **Output includes the modified array:**  Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to show the updated array contents after removing duplicates, making it easier to verify correctness.



This version is more robust, efficient, and easier to understand. It strictly adheres to the specified method signatures while providing a complete and correct solution.
