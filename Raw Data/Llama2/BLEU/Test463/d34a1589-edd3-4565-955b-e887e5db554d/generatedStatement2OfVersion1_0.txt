Key improvements and explanations:

* **Uses `NavigableMap`:**  This interface (implemented by `TreeMap`) provides the `subMap()` method which is essential for this task.
* **Clearer variable names:**  Using names like `originalMap`, `startKey`, and `endKey` improves readability.
* **`true` /`false` inclusion flags in `subMap()`:** The code clearly demonstrates both *inclusive* and *exclusive* submaps, explaining the use of the boolean arguments in `subMap()`.
* **Handles edge cases:** The code includes a `try-catch` block to illustrate what happens when the `fromKey` is greater than the `toKey` (throws `IllegalArgumentException`).
* **Demonstrates side effects:** The code explicitly shows that changes in the submap affect the original map, as they share the same backing data structure.
* **Helper `printMap` function:**  Makes the output cleaner and easier to understand.
* **Comments explain key concepts**:  Added comments to guide the reader through the code's logic and purpose.
