Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The `isCube()` method now correctly handles negative numbers. The cube of a negative number is negative.
2. **Efficient Cubic Root Approach:** Uses `Math.cbrt()` to calculate the cubic root and then checks if the cube of the rounded root equals the original number. This is the most efficient way.
3. **Clearer `main` Method:** The example in `main` is simplified to directly test with a sample number. The commented-out section shows how to handle user input with a `Scanner` and basic error handling (important if you were taking input in a real application).
4. **Comments and Explanations:** Added more comments to explain the logic and choices. 
5. **Removed Redundant Optimization in Loop:**  The loop approach (commented out) had an optimization that wasn't necessary when using `Math.cbrt()` so it was removed to keep the code simpler and focus on the best approach.
