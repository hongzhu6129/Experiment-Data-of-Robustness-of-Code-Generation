Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Command-Line Argument:** The program now accepts the filename as a command-line argument, making it more flexible.  It checks if a filename is provided and prints usage instructions if not.
2. **User Input:**  It prompts the user to enter the text they want to emblazon.
3. **Try-with-resources:** Uses try-with-resources to ensure that the files are closed properly, even if exceptions occur.
4. **BufferedReader/BufferedWriter:**  Uses `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` for more efficient file reading and writing, especially for larger files.
5. **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions`.  It provides a more informative error message.
6. **Clearer Output:** Tells the user where the output file (`.emblazoned` extension) is written.
7. **Prepending Text:** Emblazons by adding the text to the *beginning* of each line in the original file, which is a more common interpretation of "emblazoning."


How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `EmblazonText.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile:
