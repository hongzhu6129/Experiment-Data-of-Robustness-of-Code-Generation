This code demonstrates two ways to swap variables:

1. **Using a temporary variable:** This is the standard and more readable approach.
2. **Without a temporary variable (using addition and subtraction):**  This approach modifies the variables directly using addition and subtraction. While it avoids a temporary variable, it can be less clear and might have overflow issues with very large numbers.


It also includes the code to print a simple face to the console.
