Key improvements:

- **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays and `null` arrays, avoiding `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` errors. The logic for these cases is clearly defined in the comments and can be adjusted based on the specific requirements.
- **Clearer testing:** The `test()` method prints the arrays being compared, the expected result, the actual result, and whether the test passed or failed.  This makes debugging and understanding the results much easier.
- **Helper method:** The `printArray()` method helps to provide a clean and readable output for the arrays.


This improved version provides more robust and understandable code for comparing the first and last elements of two integer arrays.
