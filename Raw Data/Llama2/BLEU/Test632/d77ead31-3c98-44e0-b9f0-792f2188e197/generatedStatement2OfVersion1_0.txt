Key improvements:

- **Handles edge cases:**  Includes handling for empty arrays.
- **Clearer variable names:** Uses more descriptive names (e.g., `n` for array length).
- **Improved comments:** Explains the logic more clearly.
- **Uses `Math.min`:** Prevents potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when `i` becomes larger than the array size.
- **More comprehensive testing in `main`:** Tests with both present and non-present elements, and also an empty array.


This improved version is more robust, readable, and efficient.  It adheres to the specified method signatures and provides a correct implementation of exponential search.
