**Explanation:**

The fact that this code compiles and runs successfully *is* the proof that Java is installed.  The `System.getProperty()` method retrieves system properties, including details about the Java installation.  If Java weren't installed, this code wouldn't compile or run in the first place.  Therefore, printing any output (especially Java-specific system properties) confirms the presence of a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).


**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CheckJavaInstallation.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac CheckJavaInstallation.java`
3. **Run:**  If compilation is successful, run the program with: `java CheckJavaInstallation`

The output will display information about the Java installation, demonstrating that Java is indeed installed on your system.  If Java isn't installed, you'll encounter errors during the compilation or execution steps.
