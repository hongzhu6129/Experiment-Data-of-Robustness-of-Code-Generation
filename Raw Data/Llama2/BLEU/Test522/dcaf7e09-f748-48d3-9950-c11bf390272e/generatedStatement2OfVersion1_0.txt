Key improvements:

* **Handles negative numbers:** The code now correctly handles multiplication involving negative numbers by using recursion and negation.
* **Handles zero:**  Explicitly handles the case where one of the numbers is zero.  This is important for correct functionality and to prevent infinite recursion.
* **Clearer recursive logic:**  The recursive calls are now more straightforward, clearly showing how `b` is decremented (or incremented if negative) towards the base case of 0.


This revised solution fully addresses the prompt's requirements and is more robust and correct. It utilizes recursion to achieve multiplication without the prohibited operators and loops.
