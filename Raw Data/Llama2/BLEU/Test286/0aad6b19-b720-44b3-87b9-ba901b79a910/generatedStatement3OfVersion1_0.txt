This improved version uses `BigDecimal` to handle very large or very small numbers and avoid potential overflow/underflow issues. The `ROUND_HALF_UP` rounding mode is used for more accurate results.  You might need to adjust the precision (the second argument to `divide`) depending on the required accuracy.
