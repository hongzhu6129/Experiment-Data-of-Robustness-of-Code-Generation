To compile and run this code:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ReadFileLineByLine.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the command:  `javac ReadFileLineByLine.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with the file path as a command-line argument: `java ReadFileLineByLine /path/to/your/file.txt`  (Replace `/path/to/your/file.txt` with the actual path to your file).


If you don't provide a file path as an argument, the program will print a message asking you to do so and then exit.  This makes the program more robust and user-friendly.
