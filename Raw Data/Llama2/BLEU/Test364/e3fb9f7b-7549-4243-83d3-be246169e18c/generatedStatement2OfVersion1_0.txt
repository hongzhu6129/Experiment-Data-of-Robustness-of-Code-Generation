Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles empty and null arrays gracefully:**  The code now checks if the array itself is null or empty, printing a message in those cases. It also checks for empty rows *within* the 2D array and handles them appropriately.
* **Clearer output:**  Adds a space after each "t" or "f" for better readability.
* **More robust:** Handles cases where rows within the 2D array might have different lengths (jagged arrays). This is important for real-world scenarios where arrays might not always be perfectly rectangular.
* **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to use the method with different types of boolean arrays (including empty and uneven ones). This makes the code easier to understand and test.


This revised code is more comprehensive and addresses potential issues that the previous version didn't. It provides a more reliable and user-friendly solution for printing boolean arrays.
