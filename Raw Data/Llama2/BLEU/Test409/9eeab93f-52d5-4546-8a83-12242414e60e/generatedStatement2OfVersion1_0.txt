**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **`import java.io.*`:**  Imports necessary classes for file I/O (Input/Output).
2. **`String filePath`:**  Replace `"path/to/your/file.txt"` with the actual path to your text file.  This can be an absolute path (e.g., "C:/Users/YourName/Documents/file.txt") or a relative path (e.g., "data/my_file.txt" if the file is in a "data" folder within your project).
3. **`try-with-resources`:** The `try (BufferedReader reader = ...)` syntax ensures that the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed even if an error occurs, preventing resource leaks.
4. **`BufferedReader`:**  Used for efficient reading of the file line by line.  It wraps a `FileReader`.
5. **`FileReader`:**  Reads characters from the file.
6. **`reader.readLine()`:** Reads a single line from the file.  It returns `null` when the end of the file is reached.
7. **`System.out.println(line)`:** Prints the current line to the console.  You can replace this with any other processing you want to do with the line (e.g., store it in a list, perform calculations, etc.).
8. **`catch (IOException e)`:** Handles potential `IOExceptions` that might occur during file reading (e.g., if the file doesn't exist or there are permissions issues).  It prints an error message to the console.


**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ReadPlainTextFile.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler:
