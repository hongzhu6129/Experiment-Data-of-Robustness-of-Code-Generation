**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases to validate the program's output:

**1. Standard Cases:**

* **Input Range:** 1 to 100 (as specified)
* **Expected Output:**
    * Divisible by 3: 3 6 9 12 15 ... 99
    * Divisible by 5: 5 10 15 20 ... 100
    * Divisible by both: 15 30 45 60 75 90

**2. Boundary Cases:**

* **Input Range:** 0 to 1  (lower boundary)
* **Expected Output:**
    * Divisible by 3: (None)
    * Divisible by 5: (None)
    * Divisible by both: (None)

* **Input Range:** 99 to 101 (upper boundary check)
* **Expected Output:**
    * Divisible by 3: 99
    * Divisible by 5: 100
    * Divisible by both: (None)


**3. Empty Range:**

* **Input Range:** 101 to 200 (empty range within given limit)
* **Expected Output:**
    * Divisible by 3: (None)
    * Divisible by 5: (None)
    * Divisible by both: (None)

**4. Negative Numbers (although not strictly part of the problem):**

* **Input Range:** -10 to 10
* **Expected Output:**
    * Divisible by 3: -9 -6 -3 0 3 6 9
    * Divisible by 5: -10 -5 0 5 10
    * Divisible by both: 0



**How to Test:**

1. **Manual Inspection:** Run the code and visually compare the output with the expected values for each test case.
2. **Automated Tests (Recommended):**  Using a testing framework like JUnit is the best way to ensure correctness.  You can create test methods for each case:
