**Test Cases (including corner cases):**

| Dividend | Divisor | Expected Output |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | 3 | 1 |
| 15 | 5 | 0 |
| 7 | 9 | 7 |  // Dividend < Divisor
| 0 | 4 | 0 | // Dividend = 0
| -10 | 3 | -1 | // Negative Dividend
| 10 | -3 | 1 |  // Negative Divisor
| -10 | -3 | -1 | // Both Negative
| 2147483647 | 2 | 1 | // Integer.MAX_VALUE
| -2147483648 | 2 | 0 | // Integer.MIN_VALUE (careful with overflow in subtraction method)
| 10 | 0 | ArithmeticException: Cannot divide by zero. | // Divisor = 0
| 0 | 0 | ArithmeticException: Cannot divide by zero. | // Both zero


**Explanation of the Code and Handling Corner Cases:**

1. **Zero Divisor:** The code explicitly checks for a zero divisor and throws an `ArithmeticException` if encountered.  This is crucial for preventing runtime errors.

2. **Negative Numbers:** The code handles negative dividends and divisors by converting them to their positive counterparts and adjusting the final result's sign if necessary.  This ensures correct modulus calculation regardless of the signs of the input numbers.

3. **Dividend Smaller than Divisor:** If the dividend is smaller than the divisor (both positive), the modulus is simply the dividend itself. The `while` loop won't execute in this case.

4. **Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE:** These are included as test cases to check for potential overflow issues, especially when using the repeated subtraction method. The provided implementation handles `Integer.MAX_VALUE` correctly. `Integer.MIN_VALUE` requires some extra caution. You can add more robust overflow checks if you expect to work with numbers close to these limits frequently.

5. **Repeated Subtraction Method:** This method works by repeatedly subtracting the divisor from the dividend until the dividend becomes smaller than the divisor. The final remaining value of the dividend is the modulus.


This improved version of the code addresses corner cases and provides a more robust solution for calculating modulus without the built-in operator. Remember to test your code thoroughly with various input values, including edge cases, to ensure its correctness.
