**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **`calculatePi(int numTerms)` Method:**  This method now takes an integer `numTerms` as input, representing the number of terms to include in the approximation.  This makes the code more flexible and reusable.

2. **Clearer Sign Handling:** The logic for determining the sign (+ or -) of each term is more explicit. The `if (denominator % 4 == 1 && denominator!=1) `condition handles the cases where the sign should be positive for denominators like 9, 17, 25 etc.

3. **Using `1.0`:** The code uses `1.0` and `-1.0` for double precision, as requested.

4. **Output:** The `main` method now calculates and prints the approximations for both 5 terms (up to 1/11) and 6 terms (up to 1/13), making the output more informative.

5. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic clearly.


This improved version addresses the issues in the previous responses and provides a more accurate, readable, and flexible solution to the problem.
