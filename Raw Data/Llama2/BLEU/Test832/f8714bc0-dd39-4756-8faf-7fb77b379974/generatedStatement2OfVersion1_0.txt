Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Clearer Example with Custom Format:** Demonstrates converting back to a string using a custom `DateTimeFormatter`, which is a common use case.
* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `DateTimeParseException` if the input string is not in the expected format. This makes the code more robust.
* **Additional Example:** Added a second conversion example with a different date/time format ("MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm") to show the flexibility of `DateTimeFormatter`.
* **ISO-8601 Format by Default:**  Uses the standard ISO-8601 format initially, which is a good practice for date-time strings.
* **Comments:**  Added more comments to explain the code's functionality.


This enhanced version provides a more complete and practical example of date-time string conversion in Java within the constraints of the `main` method.
