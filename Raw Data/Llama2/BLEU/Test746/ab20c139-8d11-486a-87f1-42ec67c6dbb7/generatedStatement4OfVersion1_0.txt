Key Difference from Permutations without Repetition:

The crucial difference between this code (permutations *with* repetition) and code for permutations *without* repetition is that in the `showPermutation` method, we are iterating through *all* characters of the original string in each recursive call.  In permutations *without* repetition, you would typically use a mechanism (like swapping characters or using a boolean array) to keep track of which characters have already been used in the current permutation so that they are not repeated.
