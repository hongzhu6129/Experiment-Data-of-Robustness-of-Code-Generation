Here's how it addresses the problem using only the specified methods:

1. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - This method takes the input string (e.g., "abb").
   - It calls `permutationWithRepeation` to start the permutation process.

2. **`permutationWithRepeation(String str)`:**
   - This method initializes the process by calling `showPermutation` with the original string and an empty prefix.

3. **`showPermutation(String str, String prefix)`:**
   - This is the recursive method that generates the permutations.
   - **Base Case:** If the `prefix` length equals the original string length, it means a complete permutation is formed. The `prefix` is printed, and the function returns.
   - **Recursive Step:** It iterates through each character of the original string (`str`). In each iteration:
     - It adds the current character to the `prefix`.
     - It makes a recursive call to `showPermutation` with the same original string (`str`) and the updated `prefix`.  This is where the "with repetition" part happens � the same character can be chosen multiple times at different positions in the prefix.


**Example Output (for input "abb"):**
