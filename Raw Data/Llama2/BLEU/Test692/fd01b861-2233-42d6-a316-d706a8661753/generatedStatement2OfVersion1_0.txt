Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes error handling for `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. If you try to insert at an invalid position (e.g., a negative index or an index greater than or equal to the size of the list), it will print a clear error message instead of crashing.

2. **Clearer Output:** The output now explicitly states "Updated LinkedList:" so it's easy to see the result of the insertion.

3. **Example with Invalid Position:**  The code now includes a demonstration of how the error handling works by attempting to insert at an out-of-bounds index.

4. **Conciseness:**  The logic is streamlined and easy to follow.


How the core `insertElement` logic works (using LinkedList's built-in method):

The `LinkedList` class in Java provides a built-in `add(int index, E element)` method. This method inserts the specified element at the specified position (index) in the list.  The other elements are shifted accordingly.  Using this built-in method makes the code much simpler and more efficient than manually manipulating nodes.
