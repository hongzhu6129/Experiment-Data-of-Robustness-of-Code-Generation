**Test Cases:**

1. **General Case:**
   - Input: a = 5, b = 10
   - Expected Output: Before swapping: a = 5, b = 10
                     After swapping: a = 10, b = 5

2. **Zero Values:**
   - Input: a = 0, b = 15
   - Expected Output: Before swapping: a = 0, b = 15
                     After swapping: a = 15, b = 0

3. **Negative Values:**
   - Input: a = -3, b = 7
   - Expected Output: Before swapping: a = -3, b = 7
                     After swapping: a = 7, b = -3

4. **Identical Values:**  (This is a corner case�though simple, it's important to ensure identical values are handled correctly)
   - Input: a = 5, b = 5
   - Expected Output: Before swapping: a = 5, b = 5
                     After swapping: a = 5, b = 5

5. **Large Values:** (Tests potential integer overflow if you were using a smaller data type, though `int` is unlikely to overflow in typical scenarios)
   - Input: a = 2147483647, b = -2147483648  (Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE)
   - Expected Output: Before swapping: a = 2147483647, b = -2147483648
                     After swapping: a = -2147483648, b = 2147483647



**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You can manually input these test values when prompted by the program.  For more automated testing, you would typically use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a very simple example of how you might structure a JUnit test (you would need to add the JUnit library to your project):
