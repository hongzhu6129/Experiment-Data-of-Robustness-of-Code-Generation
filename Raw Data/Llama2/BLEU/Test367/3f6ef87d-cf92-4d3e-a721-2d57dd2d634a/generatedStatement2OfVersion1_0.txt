**Explanation and Key improvements:**

1. **`compareTo()` Method:** The `compareTo()` method is the standard way to compare strings lexicographically in Java.  It returns:
   - 0 if the strings are equal.
   - A negative value if the first string is lexicographically less than the second.
   - A positive value if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second.

2. **`equals()` Method:** The `equals()` method checks for *exact* equality (same characters, same length, same case).  This is a simpler way to check for lexicographical equality if you don't need the "less than" or "greater than" information.

3. **Case Sensitivity:** The example now demonstrates the impact of case sensitivity when comparing strings using `compareTo()`.  It also shows `equalsIgnoreCase()` for case-insensitive comparison.

4. **Command-Line Arguments:**  The code now handles command-line arguments. If you run the program with two string arguments, it will compare them using `compareTo()`.  This makes the program more versatile.

5. **Clearer Output:** The `println()` statements now provide more descriptive output, making it easier to understand the results of the comparisons.


**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StringComparison.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:  `javac StringComparison.java`
3. **Run:**  `java StringComparison string1 string2`  (Replace `string1` and `string2` with the strings you want to compare).  If you don't provide command-line arguments, the program will use the default sample strings.
