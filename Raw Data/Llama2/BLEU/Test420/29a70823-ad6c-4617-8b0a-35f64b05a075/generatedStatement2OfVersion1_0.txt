**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Input Handling:** The `main` method now checks if exactly one argument is provided.  This prevents an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if no arguments are given.  It also informs the user about the expected input.

2. **Error Handling (NumberFormatException):**  A `try-catch` block is added to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters non-numeric input. This prevents the program from crashing.

3. **Clearer Validation Method:**  The `validate` method now returns a string confirming that the glucosinolates have been (virtually) set.  In a real-world scenario, this method would likely interact with other parts of the system to perform the actual setting operation (e.g., database interaction, changing object properties).

4. **Adherence to Method Signatures:** The code strictly adheres to the required method signatures `public static void main(String[])` and `public static String validate(int)`.

**How to Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `GlucosinolateSetter.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac GlucosinolateSetter.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the program with an integer argument: `java GlucosinolateSetter 5`  (replace `5` with any desired number).
