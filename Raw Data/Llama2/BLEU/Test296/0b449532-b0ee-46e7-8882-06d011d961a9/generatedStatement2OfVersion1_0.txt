Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clear Method Signatures:** The code adheres strictly to the required `main` and `Saddleback` method signatures.

2. **Saddleback Search Implementation:** The `Saddleback` function efficiently searches the sorted 2D array.  It starts at the top-right corner and moves either down or left based on the comparison with the target.

3. **Return Array:** `Saddleback` returns an `int[]` containing the row and column indices of the target.  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.  This makes it clear whether the element was found or not.


4. **Example Usage and Testing:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function and includes a test case with an element that is not present in the array to show the "not found" handling.


5. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic and purpose of different parts of the code, improving readability.


6. **Conciseness and Efficiency:** The code is concise and avoids unnecessary complexity, following best practices for clarity and maintainability.
