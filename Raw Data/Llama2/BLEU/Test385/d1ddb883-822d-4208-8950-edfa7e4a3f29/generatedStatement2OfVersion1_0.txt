Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Output:** The output now explicitly states whether a security manager is present or not.  It also handles the case where an environment variable is not found, rather than printing `null`.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** For the `TEMP` and `USERNAME` environment variables, the code now acknowledges that different operating systems might use slightly different names (e.g., `TMP` instead of `TEMP`, `USER` instead of `USERNAME`).  It provides suggestions for alternatives if the primary variable isn't found.
* **Error Handling (for environment variables):** Checks if the environment variables are null before printing them to avoid NullPointerExceptions.
* **Conciseness:** The code remains concise and easy to understand.
* **Best Practices:** Uses `System.getenv()` which is the recommended way to access environment variables in Java.


To compile and run:

1. Save the code as `CheckSecurityManagerAndEnvVariables.java`.
2. Compile: `javac CheckSecurityManagerAndEnvVariables.java`
3. Run: `java CheckSecurityManagerAndEnvVariables`


The output will show whether a security manager is set and the values of the specified environment variables (or a message if they are not defined).
