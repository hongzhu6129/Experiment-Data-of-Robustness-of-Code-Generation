Key improvements in this version:

* **More Robust Regex:** The regular expression is now more flexible and can handle various phone number formats, including those with or without country codes, parentheses around the area code, and hyphens or spaces.
* **Clearer Comments:**  Comments explain the regex and its flexibility.
* **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `validate` method with various valid and invalid phone numbers, making the code easier to understand and test.
* **Conciseness:**  The code is more concise while still being readable.


Remember to adjust the regular expression within the `validate` method to match the specific phone number format requirements you have.  For example, if you only need to validate US phone numbers, you can use a more specific regex.
