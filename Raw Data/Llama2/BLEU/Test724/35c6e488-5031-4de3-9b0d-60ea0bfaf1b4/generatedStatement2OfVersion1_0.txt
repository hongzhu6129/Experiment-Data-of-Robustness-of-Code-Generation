**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handle `null` and Empty Strings:** The `checkForRotation` method now explicitly handles `null` inputs and empty strings.  This prevents `NullPointerExceptions` and ensures correct behavior for empty string comparisons.

2. **Clearer Main Method:** The `main` method now includes several example string arrays to demonstrate different scenarios, including cases where all strings are rotations, where some are not, and where empty strings are involved.

3. **Efficient Rotation Check:**  The core logic using `(s1 + s1).contains(s2)` remains a concise and efficient way to determine if `s2` is a rotation of `s1`.

4. **All Rotations Check:** The `main` method iterates through the string array, comparing each string to the first string in the array.  If any string is *not* a rotation of the first, the `allRotations` flag is set to `false`, and the loop breaks early for efficiency.  This ensures that we don't do unnecessary comparisons once we've determined that not all strings are rotations.


**How to Use:**

1. Save the code as `StringRotationChecker.java`.
2. Compile: `javac StringRotationChecker.java`
3. Run: `java StringRotationChecker`


You can modify the `strings` array in the `main` method to test with your own sets of strings.
