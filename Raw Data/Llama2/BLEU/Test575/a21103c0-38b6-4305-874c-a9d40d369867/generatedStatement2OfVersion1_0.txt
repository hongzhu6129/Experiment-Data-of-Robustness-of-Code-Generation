**Test Cases:**

While this program doesn't take any input and simply prints a face, we can still consider some "tests" to verify correctness.  These aren't automated tests in the traditional sense, but rather checks to confirm the output is as expected.

1. **Visual Inspection:**  Run the program and visually inspect the output.  Does it look like the intended face? Check for correct spacing and characters. This is the primary "test" for this kind of program.

2. **Output Redirection:**  Redirect the output to a file and compare it to an expected output file. This allows for a more automated check.
