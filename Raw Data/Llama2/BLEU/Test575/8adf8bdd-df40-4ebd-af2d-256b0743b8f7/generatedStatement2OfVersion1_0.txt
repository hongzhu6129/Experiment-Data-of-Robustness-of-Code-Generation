**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handle Invalid Input:** The code now checks for `size <= 0` and prints an error message.
2. **Adjusted Spacing:** Improved the spacing calculations, particularly between the eyes and ears and for different face sizes.  This ensures the face aligns correctly even with larger sizes.
3. **Simplified Ears:** The logic for printing the ears is simplified and handles size 1 and size 2 cases more elegantly.
4. **Clearer Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic more clearly.
5. **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  Included test cases for different sizes, including corner cases (size 1, 0, and -1).
