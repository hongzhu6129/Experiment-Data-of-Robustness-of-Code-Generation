Key improvements in this testing approach:

* **Automated Testing:** Using JUnit makes the test repeatable and part of a larger test suite.
* **Output Capture:** Redirecting `System.out` allows us to programmatically check the printed output.
* **Cross-Platform:** The use of `\r\n` ensures the test works correctly on Windows systems.  You might want to adjust this if your target platform uses different line endings (e.g., `\n` for Linux/macOS).





Most importantly for the simple face printing example, careful visual inspection of the output will be the most practical test.  The JUnit example is more to illustrate good testing principles that would be highly valuable for more complex programs.
