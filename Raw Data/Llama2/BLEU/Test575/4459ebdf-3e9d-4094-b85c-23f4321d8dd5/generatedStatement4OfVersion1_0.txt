2. **Output Redirection Test (More of a system test):**
   - Redirect the output to a file: `java FacePrinter > face.txt`
   - Open `face.txt` and verify the face is correctly printed. This tests whether output redirection works as expected.

3. **Different Character Encoding (Edge Case - System Dependent):**
   - If you're concerned about different character sets or encodings potentially impacting the rendering (e.g., if you were using more complex Unicode characters), you could try setting different console/terminal encodings and verifying the output still appears correctly.  This is less of a Java code issue and more an environment/system issue.

4. **Extremely Long Output Line (Edge Case - Highly Unlikely Here):**
   - While unlikely with this simple face, in other string-building scenarios, extremely long lines might cause issues with some output buffers.  This is usually a concern with very large dynamic string generation.  Since the face is a fixed small size, this is a very low-probability edge case.


**How to "Automate" the Visual Test (Not strictly unit testing):**

While visual inspection is often sufficient for this simple example, you could, in a more complex scenario, capture the program's output to a string and compare it to the expected output string.  This would require using something like `System.setOut()` to redirect the output to a `ByteArrayOutputStream`, which can be converted back to a string for comparison.  This is more involved than necessary for this program, but it demonstrates a way to automate the visual check:
