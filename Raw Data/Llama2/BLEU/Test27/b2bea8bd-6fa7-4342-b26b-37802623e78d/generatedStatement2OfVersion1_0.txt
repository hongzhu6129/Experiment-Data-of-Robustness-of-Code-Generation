Key improvements in this version:

- **Clarity and Readability:**  Added comments to explain the logic of the Sieve algorithm more clearly.  Used more descriptive variable names.
- **Efficiency:** The outer loop now runs only up to the square root of `n` ( `p * p <= n` ), which is a standard optimization for the Sieve.
- **Correctness:** The inner loop starts at `p * p`, correctly marking multiples of `p`. This avoids unnecessarily marking numbers that are already marked.
- **Output Formatting:** Added a newline at the end of the output for cleaner presentation, especially when running multiple tests in `main`.
- **Example Usage:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `generatePrimes` method with different inputs.



This revised code provides a robust and efficient implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes in Java, adhering to the specified method signatures.
