**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases including corner and edge cases:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Output: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -70
   - Expected Output: 0 km

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0 
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0 (Longitude doesn't matter at the poles)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)


4. **Antipodal Points (Opposite sides of the Earth):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -70
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 110  (180 degrees opposite longitude)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)


5. **Points near the 180th Meridian (International Date Line):**
   - lat1: 10
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 10
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Output: Small distance (because they are close despite the longitude difference)

6. **Invalid Input:**
   - lat1: "abc"  (or any non-numeric input) � the program should handle this gracefully (e.g., with an error message or exception).  Using `Scanner.nextDouble()` will throw an `InputMismatchException` if the input is not a valid `double`.


7. **Extreme Latitudes/Longitudes:**
   - lat1: 90  
   - lon1: 180
   - lat2: -89.9999
   - lon2: -179.9999
   - Expected Output:  A valid distance (tests handling of values very close to the limits)
