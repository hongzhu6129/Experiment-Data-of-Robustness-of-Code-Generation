**Test Cases and Corner Cases:**

1. **Standard Case (Java Installed):**  Run the program on a system with a standard Java installation (e.g., Oracle JDK, OpenJDK). Expected output: "Java is installed on this system."

2. **Java Not Installed:** Run the program on a system where Java is not installed at all. Expected output: "Java is NOT installed on this system."

3. **Java in Non-Standard Location:**
   -  Modify your system's PATH environment variable temporarily to REMOVE the Java bin directory.  Run the program. Expected output: "Java is NOT installed on this system." (Because it's not findable on the path).
   - Restore your PATH environment variable correctly afterward!

4. **Java Executable Renamed:** (Corner Case)
   - If someone has mischievously renamed the `java` executable in the Java bin directory (e.g., to `java_backup`), the program will report that Java is not installed. This is because our check specifically looks for `java`.  You might need to adjust the code if you need to handle this extremely unusual scenario.

5. **Permissions Issues:** (Corner Case)
   - It's possible (though unlikely) that the user running the program doesn't have execute permissions on the `java` executable.  In this case, you might get "Java is NOT installed on this system."  You would need to fix the permissions issue at the OS level.

6. **OpenJDK Variations:** Test with different OpenJDK distributions (e.g., AdoptOpenJDK, Zulu OpenJDK) to ensure the code handles the variations in version string output.

7. **`java -version` Output Changes:** (Future-proofing) Oracle or OpenJDK might slightly change the format of the `java -version` output in future releases. The code's `startsWith()` check makes it reasonably robust, but you might want to use a regular expression to parse the version string more reliably for long-term stability.




**How to Run Test Cases (Example using case 3 - Java in Non-Standard Location):**

* **Windows (Powershell Example - Adjust for your shell):**
    1. Check current PATH: `$env:Path`
    2.  Temporarily remove Java from PATH (replace `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.2\bin` with your actual Java path):
