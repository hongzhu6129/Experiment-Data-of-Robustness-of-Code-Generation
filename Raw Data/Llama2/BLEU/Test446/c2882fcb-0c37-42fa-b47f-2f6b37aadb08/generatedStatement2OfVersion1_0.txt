**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The `polyEval` method efficiently implements Horner's method for polynomial evaluation. This method minimizes the number of multiplications required, making it faster than other approaches.

2. **Clearer Coefficient Handling:**  The coefficients are stored in a `List<Double>`.  This allows for polynomials of any degree (within the limits of list size).  The coefficients are added to the list in ascending order of the power of x (constant term first, then x term, then x^2 term, etc.) which makes it align directly with how we typically represent polynomials.

3. **Iterative Approach:** The `polyEval` method uses a simple and efficient `for` loop to iterate through the coefficients, applying Horner's rule.

4. **Example in `main`:**  The `main` method provides a clear example of how to use `polyEval` with the specific polynomial -19 + 7x - 4x^2 + 6x^3 and x = 3.

5. **Comments:**  The code includes comments to explain the purpose of each part.



This improved version is more efficient, more flexible (can handle polynomials of any degree), more readable, and demonstrates best practices for Java coding.
