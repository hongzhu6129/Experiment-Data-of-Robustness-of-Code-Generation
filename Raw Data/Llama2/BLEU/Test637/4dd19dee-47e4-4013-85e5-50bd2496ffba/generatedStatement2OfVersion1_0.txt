**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases to consider, including corner/edge cases:

1. **Standard Case:**
   - Radius: 7.5
   - Expected Perimeter: ~47.12
   - Expected Area: ~176.71

2. **Zero Radius:**
   - Radius: 0
   - Expected Perimeter: 0
   - Expected Area: 0

3. **Negative Radius (Invalid Input):**
   - Radius: -5
   - Expected Behavior:  The program should ideally handle this gracefully.  A good approach is to print an error message indicating that the radius cannot be negative, or throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.  Simply calculating with the negative value will produce a numerically correct but conceptually meaningless result.

4. **Very Large Radius:**
   - Radius: 1000000 (or some other large number)
   - Purpose:  To test if the program handles large numbers correctly without overflow or other issues.

5. **Small Radius (Close to Zero):**
   - Radius: 0.0001
   - Purpose: Test behavior with very small numbers, checking for potential rounding errors or unexpected results.

6. **Maximum Double Value:**
   - Radius: Double.MAX_VALUE
   - Expected Behavior:  Test the limits of the `double` data type. You might expect an `Infinity` result for the area.
