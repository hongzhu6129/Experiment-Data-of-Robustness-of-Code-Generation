Key Improvements and Explanations:

* **JUnit Tests:** The code now includes JUnit 5 tests, which are essential for verifying the correctness of the calculations.  The `@Test` annotation marks methods as test cases.  `assertEquals` checks if the calculated value matches the expected value within a specified delta (tolerance).

* **Corner Cases:** The tests cover important corner cases:
    * Zero radius:  A circle with zero radius should have zero area and zero perimeter.
    * Extremely small radius:  Tests with a very small radius help ensure the calculations handle small values correctly.

* **Negative Radius Handling:** The code now demonstrates how to use JUnit to test for exceptions. Since a negative radius is not physically meaningful, the tests are written to expect an `IllegalArgumentException` if you attempt to calculate with a negative radius.  (You'd need to add actual exception throwing within `calculateArea` and `calculatePerimeter` if you want the tests to pass as written. Alternatively, you could provide a default behavior for negative radius, like returning 0 or the absolute value).

* **Clearer Output:** The `main` method now labels the output for better readability.

* **Accuracy:** Using `Math.PI` provides more accurate calculations than using a hardcoded approximation like 3.14.

How to Run JUnit Tests:

Most IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans) have built-in support for running JUnit tests. You can usually right-click on the test class or method and select "Run".  Alternatively, you can run them from the command line using build tools like Maven or Gradle.


This improved version is much more robust and demonstrates good testing practices, which are crucial for software development.
