Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Includes checks for `null` and empty input arrays.
* **Clearer comments:**  Explains the logic within the `quickSort` and `exchangeNumbers` methods.
* **More robust partitioning:** Uses the middle element as the pivot to mitigate worst-case scenarios (e.g., already sorted arrays).
* **Added test cases in main:** Demonstrates usage and handles different scenarios.
* **Consistent naming:**  Uses meaningful variable names (e.g., `lowerIndex`, `higherIndex`).
