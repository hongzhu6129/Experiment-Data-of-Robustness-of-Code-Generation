Key Changes and Explanations:

1. **`inputArr` as a Member Variable:** The `inputArr` is made a member variable of the `QuickSort` class. This allows the `quickSort` and `exchangeNumbers` methods to access it directly without needing it to be passed as an argument every time.

2. **Initializing `inputArr`:**  In the `main` method, `inputArr` is initialized before calling the `sort` method.

3. **Method Signatures Maintained:** The required method signatures (`sort`, `quickSort`, `exchangeNumbers`, `main`) are strictly adhered to.

4. **Clearer Comments:**  Added comments to enhance understanding of the code's logic.

5. **Robustness:** Added a check in the `sort` method to handle null or empty input arrays gracefully.


This revised code effectively implements the Quicksort algorithm while respecting the given method signature constraints. It's also more organized and readable.
