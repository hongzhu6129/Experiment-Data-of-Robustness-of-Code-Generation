Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `lowerIndex` and `higherIndex` instead of `i` and `j` in the outer `quickSort` makes the code easier to follow. `i` and `j` are now used within the partitioning loop, which is more conventional.
* **Pivot Selection:** The pivot is now calculated using `array[lowerIndex + (higherIndex - lowerIndex) / 2]`.  This is important to avoid potential integer overflow if `(lowerIndex + higherIndex)` exceeds the maximum integer value.  It's the recommended way to calculate the middle index.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic more clearly, particularly the partitioning process.
* **Example Usage:** Included a `main` method with an example array to demonstrate how to use the `QuickSort` class.
* **Output:** Added printing the sorted array to the console for verification.
