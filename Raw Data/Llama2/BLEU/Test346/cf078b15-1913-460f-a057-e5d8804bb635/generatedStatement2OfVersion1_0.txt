Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles Invalid Offsets:** The `getOffsetInSeconds` method now uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `DateTimeParseException` if the input offset string is invalid. This prevents the program from crashing and allows you to handle the error gracefully (e.g., log the error or return a default value).
* **Clearer Error Handling:**  Instead of simply printing an error message to the console, the `getOffsetInSeconds` could be modified to throw an exception if the offset string is invalid. This lets calling methods handle the error in a more structured way.
* **Uses `ZonedDateTime`:** Using `ZonedDateTime` for extracting offsets associated with time zones is preferred, as it's designed to handle time zone rules and DST.
* **Improved Formatting:** The `formatOffset` method now correctly handles positive and negative offsets and ensures two digits for hours and minutes (e.g., +02:00, -05:00).
* **More robust offset parsing:**  Handles "Z" for UTC correctly as well as offsets like "+02:00" and "-05:00".


This improved version is more robust, handles errors better, and provides a clearer example of how to define and extract zone offsets in Java. It's also more aligned with best practices for using `java.time` classes.
