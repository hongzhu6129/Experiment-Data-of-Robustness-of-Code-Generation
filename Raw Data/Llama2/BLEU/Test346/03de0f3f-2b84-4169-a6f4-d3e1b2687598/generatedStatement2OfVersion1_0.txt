Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Clarity and Readability:** The code is now more clearly structured and easier to understand. Comments explain the purpose of each section.
2. **`getOffset` function:** This function now handles the retrieval of the offset in a cleaner way, using `ZonedDateTime` and `ZoneOffset`. It returns the offset in seconds.
3. **`formatOffset` function:** This function is significantly improved:
   - It now uses `String.format` for correct formatting of the offset string, including leading zeros for hours and minutes.
   - It handles both positive and negative offsets correctly using the ternary operator and `Math.abs` for consistent output.  This ensures that "-03:00" is not displayed, but rather "-03:00".
4. **Example Usage:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the functions with some common time zones.
5. **Optional Iteration:** The commented-out loop shows how you could iterate through all available zone IDs if needed.
6. **Error Handling (Optional):** You could add a `try-catch` block in `getOffset` to handle the `ZoneRulesException` that might occur if an invalid `zoneId` is provided.


This revised code provides a more robust and user-friendly way to define and extract zone offsets in Java.
