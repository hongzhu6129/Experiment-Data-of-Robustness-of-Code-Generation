**Test Cases and Corner Cases:**

The `main` method now includes a series of test cases demonstrating different scenarios:

1. **Different Date and Time Formats:**  Tests with variations in date and time formatting strings.
2. **Time Only:** Extracts and displays only the time portion.
3. **Day and Month Names:**  Formats the output to include the full day of the week and month name.
4. **ISO 8601 Format:** Uses the standard ISO 8601 format, including the timezone.
5. **Minimal Date Format:** Tests with a minimal valid date format (`yy/M/d`).
6. **Excess Milliseconds:** Provides more millisecond precision than supported (should truncate gracefully).
7. **Invalid Format (Corner Case):**  Intentionally uses an incorrect format string (`yyyy/MMM/dd/HH`) to demonstrate exception handling (the `try...catch` block ensures a clean exit).  This shows how the program gracefully handles unexpected or invalid input.
8. **Edge Case (Year 1):**  Tests with the year 1 (a valid but sometimes edge case for date/time libraries).


**Key Improvements:**

* **Exception Handling:** The `try...catch` block prevents the program from crashing if an invalid date/time format string is provided.
* **Clearer Output:** The test cases now have more descriptive output to make it easier to understand what is being tested.
* **Edge Case Testing:**  Including the year 1 test helps ensure the code works correctly with less common but still valid inputs.
* **More Comprehensive Testing:** The added test cases cover a wider range of scenarios, improving the robustness of the code.


This improved version provides better error handling, clearer output, and more thorough testing, including corner cases and edge cases, making it much more robust and reliable.  This would be a good starting point for adding more formal unit tests if needed.
