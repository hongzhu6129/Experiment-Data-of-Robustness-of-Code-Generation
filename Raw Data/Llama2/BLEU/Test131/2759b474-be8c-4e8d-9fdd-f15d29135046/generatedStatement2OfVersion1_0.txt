Here's an explanation of the improvements in this code:

* **Handles Negative Numbers (Optional):** The `is_narc_dec_num` function now explicitly handles negative numbers. You can adjust the handling as per your requirements (e.g., return false, throw an exception, or take the absolute value).
* **Clarity and Readability:** Variable names are more descriptive (e.g., `numDigits` instead of `n`).
* **Efficiency:**  Calculates the number of digits only once.
* **Correctness:** It now accurately identifies and prints the first 15 narcissistic decimal numbers. It uses a `while` loop to continue checking numbers until 15 narcissistic numbers have been found and printed.

This revised version directly addresses the problem statement's requirement to "generate and show the first 15" by iterating until 15 have been found and printed, instead of arbitrarily stopping at a large number.
