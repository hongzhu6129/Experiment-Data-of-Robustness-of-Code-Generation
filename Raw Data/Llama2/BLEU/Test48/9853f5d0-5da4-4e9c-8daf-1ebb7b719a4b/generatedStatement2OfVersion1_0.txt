Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`java.time` API:**  Uses the modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8) for date/time handling.  It's significantly better than the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes.

2. **`DateTimeFormatter`:**  Handles date parsing correctly.  It ensures that the input dates are in the expected format ("yyyy-MM-dd").

3. **`Period`:** The `Period` class is specifically designed to represent a period of time (years, months, days).  `Period.between()` calculates the difference accurately.

4. **`try-catch` Block:**  Includes error handling to gracefully manage invalid date input.  The `DateTimeParseException` is caught if the user enters dates in the wrong format.

5. **Clear Prompts:** The code provides clear prompts to the user to enter dates in the correct format.

6. **Scanner Closed:** The `Scanner` is closed at the end of the program which is good practice to prevent resource leaks.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DateDifference.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac DateDifference.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code with: `java DateDifference`

The program will then prompt you to enter the two dates.
