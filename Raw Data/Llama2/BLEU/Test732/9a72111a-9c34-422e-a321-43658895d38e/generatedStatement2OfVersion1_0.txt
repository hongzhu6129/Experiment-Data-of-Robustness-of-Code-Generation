Key improvements in this version:

- **Clarity and Readability:** Improved variable names (e.g., `currentInterval`, `nextInterval`) and comments make the code easier to follow.
- **Correctness:**  The logic for merging intervals is now accurate, ensuring that overlapping and adjacent intervals are merged correctly.
- **Completeness:** Includes a `main` method with a sample test case and prints the merged intervals, making the code executable and demonstrating its functionality.
- **Adherence to Restrictions:** Uses only the specified method signatures.
- **Object-Oriented:** The `Interval` class encapsulates the start and end of an interval, which is good practice.  
- **Efficient Sorting:** Uses `Collections.sort` with a `Comparator` for efficient sorting of intervals.
