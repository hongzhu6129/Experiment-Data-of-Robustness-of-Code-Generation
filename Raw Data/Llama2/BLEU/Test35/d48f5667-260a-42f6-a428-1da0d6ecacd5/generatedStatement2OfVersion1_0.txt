Key Improvements in this version:

- **Clearer Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block explicitly handles the `NumberFormatException`, providing informative error messages.
- **Dynamic Array Handling:**  Instead of fixing the array size, the code now dynamically handles cases where not all strings can be converted.  This is done in two ways:
    1. Efficient Array Resizing: After parsing, `System.arraycopy` efficiently creates a new array of the correct size, avoiding wasted space.
    2. ArrayList Approach (Commented out):  An alternative, using `ArrayList`, demonstrates how to build the integer list dynamically and then easily convert it to an array.
- **Best Practices:** The code is better structured and explains the common source of the "invalid literal" error.  Comments clearly illustrate the steps.



This improved version is more robust, flexible, and provides better error handling compared to the original attempt.
