Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`PriorityQueue<String>`:** Explicitly declares the PriorityQueue to hold Strings.
2. **Iterating with `poll()`:** The original code used `colorQueue.toString()`, which doesn't guarantee the order of elements.  A PriorityQueue is meant to be accessed/processed by removing elements in order, which is what `poll()` does.  The `poll()` method retrieves and *removes* the head (the lowest element according to the natural ordering of Strings in this case - alphabetical).
3. **`offer()` demonstration:** Shows how to add elements (equivalent to `add()`).
4. **`peek()` demonstration:**  Shows how to look at the head element *without* removing it from the queue.
5. **Clearer output and comments:** Enhanced comments and output statements to make the example easier to understand.


This improved version demonstrates the core functionality of a PriorityQueue, showing how to add elements, retrieve them in order, and peek at the head.  It also emphasizes the importance of using `poll()` (or similar methods like `remove()`) to access elements in a priority queue correctly.
