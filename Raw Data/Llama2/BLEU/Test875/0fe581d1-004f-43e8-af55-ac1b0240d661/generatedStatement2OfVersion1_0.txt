Key improvements in this version:

1. **Handles Non-Negative Constraint:**  The logic correctly leverages the fact that the input array contains only non-negative numbers.  This simplifies the code a bit.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:**  Includes checks for `null` and empty input arrays, returning 0 in those cases.

3. **Clearer Comments:**  The comments explain the reasoning behind the code more thoroughly.

4. **Illustrative Examples:**  The `main` method provides examples demonstrating the function's behavior with different inputs, including the edge cases.  I've also included one example with a negative number (even though the prompt says all inputs will be non-negative) to demonstrate how the simplified algorithm *would* handle a mixed array if that were ever a requirement.  This helps illustrate the difference in logic when negatives are allowed.


This revised version is more robust, clearer, and demonstrates a better understanding of the nuances of the problem and its constraints.
