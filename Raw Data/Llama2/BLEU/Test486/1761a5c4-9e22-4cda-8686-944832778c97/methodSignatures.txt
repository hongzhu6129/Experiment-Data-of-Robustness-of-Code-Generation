This is when a spatula can be inserted at any point in the stack and used to flip all pancakes above it. Pancake numbers are the minimum number of flips required for a given number of pancakes. The problem was first discussed by American geometer Jacob E. Goodman. It is a variation of the sorting problem in which the only allowed operation is to reverse the elements of some prefix of the sequence. \n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n Avoid using Solution as the class name.
