Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Handles Empty Array:**  Added a check at the beginning of `removeDuplicates` to handle the case of an empty input array gracefully.  This prevents potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueCount` is used instead of just `k` to make the purpose of the variable more obvious.

3. **In-Place Modification:** The algorithm modifies the original `nums` array directly as requested in the problem description, overwriting the duplicates with the unique elements.

4. **Correct Return Value:** The function correctly returns the length of the updated array (the number of unique elements).

5. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes multiple test cases, including an empty array and a more complex example, to demonstrate the correctness of the solution.

6. **Output Formatting:** The output uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant portion of the modified array (the unique elements), preventing displaying any of the leftover duplicate values that are now at the end of the array.


This improved code adheres to the specified method signatures, provides better clarity, and correctly solves the problem for various input cases.
