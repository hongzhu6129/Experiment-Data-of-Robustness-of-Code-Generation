This comprehensive example within a single `main` method demonstrates:

1. **Creating and populating LinkedLists:**  Shows basic LinkedList usage.
2. **Joining using `addAll()`:** The most common and efficient approach.  Includes explanation of creating a copy to avoid modifying the original.
3. **Joining using a loop:**  Less efficient, but illustrates iteration through a LinkedList.
4. **Joining using Java Stream API:** A more advanced technique that can be efficient for larger lists.
5. **Important Considerations:** Explains potential pitfalls like modifying the original list and how to insert at a specific position (not just appending to the end).


This enhanced example provides a much more complete educational resource for understanding how to join LinkedLists in Java.
