This code demonstrates three ways to join linked lists:

1. **`addAll()` method:** This is the simplest and most efficient way to append one list to the end of another.

2. **Iterating and adding to a new list:**  This approach creates a new list containing all elements from both original lists. This is useful if you don't want to modify the original lists.

3. **Joining at a specific index:** This demonstrates how to insert the elements of one list into another list at a particular position.  This provides more control over the joining process.


Choose the method that best suits your specific needs.  `addAll()` is generally the preferred choice for simple appending.
