Explanation:

1. **TreeMap:** We use a `TreeMap` because it stores its keys in sorted order, which makes it efficient to find the least key greater than or equal to a given key.

2. **ceilingKey() method:** The `ceilingKey(K key)` method of the `TreeMap` class directly returns the least key greater than or equal to the given `key`. If no such key exists, it returns `null`.

3. **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use `ceilingKey()` with different example keys and shows the output.  It also includes examples with String keys to illustrate that TreeMaps can be used with various data types.
