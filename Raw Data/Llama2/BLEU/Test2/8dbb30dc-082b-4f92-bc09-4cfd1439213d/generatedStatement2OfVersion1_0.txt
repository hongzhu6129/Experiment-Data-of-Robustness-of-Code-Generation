Explanation and improvements:

1. **Handles null/empty input:**  The code now checks for `null` or empty input strings and prints an empty string in those cases. This prevents `NullPointerExceptions`.

2. **StringBuilder for efficiency:** Using `StringBuilder` is much more efficient than repeated string concatenation when modifying strings in a loop.  

3. **Clearer variable names:** Using more descriptive names like `charsToRemove` and `sequenceToRemove` makes the code easier to understand.

4. **Direct character check:** The `indexOf()` method efficiently checks if a character is present in the `charsToRemove` string.

5. **Two-step removal:**  First, individual characters ("b") are removed. Then, the sequence ("ac") is removed from the intermediate result. This ensures correct removal even if the sequence contains characters in `charsToRemove`.

Example Usage and Output:


If `inputString = "abracadabra"`, `charsToRemove = "b"`, and `sequenceToRemove = "ac"`, the output will be:
