This educational example demonstrates three ways to create a max PriorityQueue in Java:

1. **`Collections.reverseOrder()`:** The simplest and most common way.  It uses a pre-defined comparator to reverse the natural ordering of elements.

2. **Lambda Expression:** A more concise way to define a custom comparator directly in the PriorityQueue constructor using a lambda expression.

3. **Separate Comparator Class:**  A more verbose approach, creating a separate class that implements the `Comparator` interface.  This is beneficial when you have more complex comparison logic.

The examples include using both `Integer` and `String` types to show how max priority queues work with different data types.  The output clearly demonstrates that elements are polled (removed) from the queue in descending order (largest to smallest).
