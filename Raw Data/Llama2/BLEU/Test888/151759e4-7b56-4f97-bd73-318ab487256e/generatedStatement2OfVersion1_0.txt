**Explanation of Results:**

* **a. `-5 + 8 * 6 = 43`:** Multiplication has higher precedence than addition, so 8 * 6 is evaluated first (48). Then, -5 + 48 = 43.

* **b. `(55 + 9) % 9 = 1`:** Parentheses have the highest precedence, so 55 + 9 is evaluated first (64). Then, 64 % 9 (the modulo operator) gives the remainder of the division, which is 1.

* **c. `20 + -3 * 5 / 8 = 19`:** Multiplication and division have equal precedence and are evaluated from left to right.  -3 * 5 is -15. Then, -15 / 8 is -1 (integer division, the fractional part is discarded). Finally, 20 + -1 = 19.

* **d. `5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3 = 13`:** Division, multiplication, and modulo have equal precedence and are evaluated left to right.  15 / 3 is 5. Then, 5 * 2 is 10.  8 % 3 is 2 (the remainder). Finally, 5 + 10 - 2 = 13.
