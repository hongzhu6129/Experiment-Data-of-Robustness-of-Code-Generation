Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Uses `java.time`:**  The modern Java date/time API (`java.time`) is used (specifically `LocalDate`, `Period`, and `DateTimeFormatter`).  Avoid the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes as they are more problematic.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** More descriptive variable names (e.g., `dateBefore1Year`, `currentDate`) improve readability.

3. **Formatting (Optional):**  `DateTimeFormatter` is used to format the dates into a more readable `yyyy-MM-dd` format.  This is optional, but recommended.

4. **Comparison Examples:**  The code demonstrates how to compare dates using `isAfter()`, `isBefore()`, and `isEqual()`.  I've included an example of calculating the difference between dates using `Period.between()`.

5. **Comments:**  Comments explain the important parts of the code.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DateComparison.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac DateComparison.java`
3. **Run:** `java DateComparison`


This improved version is more robust, readable, and uses best practices for working with dates and times in Java.
