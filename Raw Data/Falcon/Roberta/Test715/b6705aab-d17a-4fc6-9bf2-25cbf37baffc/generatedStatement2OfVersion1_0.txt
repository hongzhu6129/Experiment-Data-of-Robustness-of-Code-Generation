Key improvements and explanations in this code:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueIndex` clearly indicates its purpose.
2. **Handles Edge Cases:** Explicitly handles `null` or empty input arrays, preventing potential `NullPointerExceptions`.
3. **Concise and Efficient:**  The core logic remains efficient, modifying the array in-place.
4. **Improved `main` Method for Testing:** Provides multiple test cases in `main` to demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs, including edge cases.  It also prints the relevant part of the modified array (up to the new length) using `Arrays.copyOfRange`.
5. **Comments:** Comments explain the logic and purpose of the code.
6. **NullPointerException Safety:** The `main` method is updated to safely handle a null input, preventing a `NullPointerException` when attempting to print the array's contents.


This revised version addresses the prompt's requirements and provides a robust and well-tested solution.
