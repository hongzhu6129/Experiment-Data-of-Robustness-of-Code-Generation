Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Structure:**  The code is now divided into two main loops: one for the starred stripes and one for the solid red stripes.  This improves readability and maintainability.
* **Correct Star and Stripe Pattern:** The logic for printing the alternating rows of 6 and 5 stars is accurate.  The `%` (modulo) operator is used effectively to determine odd and even rows.
* **Consistent Stripe Length:**  The use of a nested loop ensures that the stripes have a consistent length.
* **Correct Number of Stripes:** The code now prints the correct total number of stripes (13).


This revised code produces the desired output, accurately representing the American flag's pattern. It also demonstrates good coding practices with improved structure and clarity.
