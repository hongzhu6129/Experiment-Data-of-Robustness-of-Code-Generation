Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Problem Interpretation:** The original prompt was slightly ambiguous ("exceeds depth part").  This code interprets it as finding and printing nodes that are *deeper* than a specified target depth.

2. **`maxDepth()` Remains Efficient:**  The `maxDepth()` method remains a clean and efficient recursive implementation for finding the maximum depth of the tree.

3. **`printNodesExceedingDepth()` Added:** A new helper function, `printNodesExceedingDepth()`, is introduced to specifically address the "exceeds depth" part. It takes the root, the target depth, and the current depth (initialized to 1) as arguments.

4. **Depth Tracking in `printNodesExceedingDepth()`:** The `currentDepth` parameter is crucial for tracking how deep we are in the tree during the traversal.

5. **Printing Exceeding Nodes:** Inside `printNodesExceedingDepth()`, when `currentDepth` becomes greater than `targetDepth`, we know we've found a node that exceeds the target depth, and we print its data.

6. **Recursive Calls:** The recursive calls to `printNodesExceedingDepth()` continue the traversal down both the left and right subtrees, correctly incrementing `currentDepth`.

7. **Example Usage in `main()`:** The `main()` method demonstrates how to use both `maxDepth()` to find the maximum depth and `printNodesExceedingDepth()` to find and print nodes exceeding a given depth.  A sample tree is created and the output is clear.

8. **Node Class:** The `Node` class is included for completeness, representing the structure of a node in the binary tree.



This revised code provides a much more complete and functional solution to the problem, clearly demonstrating how to find both the maximum depth and the nodes exceeding a specified depth in a binary tree.
