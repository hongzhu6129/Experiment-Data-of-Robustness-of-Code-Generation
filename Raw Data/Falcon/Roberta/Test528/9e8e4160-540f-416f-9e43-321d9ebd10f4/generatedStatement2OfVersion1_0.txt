Key improvements and explanations in this code:

1. **Handles Empty Array:**  Added a check at the beginning of `removeDuplicates` to handle the case of an empty input array gracefully.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueCount` is used instead of `j` to make the purpose of the variable more explicit.

3. **In-Place Modification:** The function modifies the original `nums` array in-place, shifting the unique elements to the beginning.

4. **Returns the Length:** The function returns the length of the updated subarray (containing only unique elements), as required by the problem statement.

5. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Included test cases with different input arrays, including an empty array, to demonstrate the functionality.

6. **Prints Updated Array (for demonstration):** In the `main` method, I've added code to print the *updated* portion of the array after removing duplicates.  This uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to create a new array containing only the first `newLength` elements, which are the unique ones. This makes it easier to see the result of the `removeDuplicates` operation.  This extra printing is for demonstration purposes in `main` and isn't strictly part of the `removeDuplicates` method's core functionality.
