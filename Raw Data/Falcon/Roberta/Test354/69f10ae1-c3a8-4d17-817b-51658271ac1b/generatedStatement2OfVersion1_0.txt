**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Output: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -74
   - Expected Output: 0 km

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

4. **Antipodes (Opposite sides of the Earth):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 106
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

5. **Points on the Equator, 180 degrees apart:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 180
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)


6. **Points near the International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 10
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 10
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Output:  A small value (as they are close despite the longitude difference)

7. **Invalid Input (Latitudes):**  Test with latitudes > 90 or < -90. The program should ideally handle this gracefully (e.g., print an error message or throw an exception) as these are invalid geographical coordinates.

8.  **Zero Longitude and Latitude:**
    - lat1: 0
    - lon1: 0
    - lat2: 30
    - lon2: 45
    - Expected Output: Calculate and verify.



By testing these cases, you ensure your program correctly calculates distances under various conditions and handles potential edge cases.  You might consider adding error handling (e.g., using `try-catch` blocks) to deal with invalid input gracefully.
