**Key improvements and explanations of the test cases:**

* **Radian Conversion:**  The main code and the test helper function now convert latitude and longitude to radians *immediately* after reading input or setting test values. This prevents errors that could occur if the calculations were done in degrees.
* **Test Cases Cover Corner Cases:**
    * **Same Point:**  Tests if the distance between two identical points is zero.
    * **Given Example:** Verifies the provided example from the prompt.
    * **Antipodes:** Checks the distance between points on opposite sides of the globe.
    * **North Pole to Equator:** Calculates the distance from the North Pole to a point on the equator.
    * **Near Poles:** Checks if the calculation remains stable when points are very close to the poles (this is important because the `cos(latitude)` term can approach zero, which can sometimes cause numerical instability).



* **Helper Function:** The `calculateDistance` helper function makes the test code cleaner and easier to read.
* **Junit5:** The test code uses Junit5 for assertions and test structure.




Remember to add JUnit to your project if you haven't already. You can use Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies easily.  This improved code and comprehensive test suite ensures better correctness and robustness for your Earth distance calculation program.
