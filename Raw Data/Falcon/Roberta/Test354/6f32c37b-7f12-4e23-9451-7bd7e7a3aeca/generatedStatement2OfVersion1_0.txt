**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -74
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0 
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

4. **Antipodes (opposite sides of Earth):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74 (New York)
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 106 (Near Perth, Australia)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

5. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 90
   - Expected Distance: ~10007.54 (approximately Earth's circumference / 4)



6. **Points near the International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 60
   - lon1: 179  (Near the Date Line)
   - lat2: 60
   - lon2: -179 (Also near the Date Line, but on the other side)
   - Expected Distance: A small distance (because these points are geographically close despite the longitude difference)

7. **Invalid Input (Latitudes):**
   - lat1: 95 (invalid latitude)
   - ... (other coordinates)
   - Expected:  The program should gracefully handle such invalid input (e.g., print an error message or throw an exception).  Consider adding input validation to your code.


**How to Test:**

You can easily test these by modifying the input values in the `main` method of your Java code or by creating a separate test class (recommended for larger projects) using JUnit or TestNG testing frameworks.  The test class can call the distance calculation method with various inputs and assert that the calculated distance is within an acceptable tolerance of the expected distance.


Key Improvements in the Code:

- **Radian Conversion:**  Crucially, the provided code now correctly converts latitude and longitude to radians using `Math.toRadians()`. This is essential for the trigonometric functions to work correctly.
- **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is more readable with comments explaining the purpose of each step.
- **Testability:** The code's structure is improved for testing (inputs are separate from the calculation).  Implementing the test cases above using JUnit would further enhance the code's robustness.
