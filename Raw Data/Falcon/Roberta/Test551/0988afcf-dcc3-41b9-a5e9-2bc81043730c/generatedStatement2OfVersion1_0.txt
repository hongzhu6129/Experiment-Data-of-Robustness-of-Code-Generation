Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Assignments:** The regex now includes `=` to allow simple variable assignments like `x = 5` to be considered valid.  You can easily modify the allowed variables (e.g., `[a-zA-Z]`) if needed.
2. **Consecutive Operators Check:** The code now explicitly checks for and rejects expressions with consecutive operators (e.g., "5 + * 7", "8 -"). This is done by removing whitespace and then using a separate regular expression.
3. **Clearer Regex:** The main regular expression is simplified and more readable.
4. **Handles Empty/Null Input:**  The `validate` method now correctly handles `null` or empty input strings.
5. **More Test Cases:**  Added more test cases in `main` to demonstrate the improved validation logic, including cases with invalid consecutive operators and trailing operators.
6. **Comments:** Added comments explaining the regular expressions and the logic.


This enhanced version provides more robust validation for mathematical expressions while still using only the required method signatures.  You can further refine the regular expression to handle more complex scenarios (exponents, functions, etc.) as per your educational needs.
