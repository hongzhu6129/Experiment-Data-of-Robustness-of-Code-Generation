Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles empty and null arrays.
* **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueCount` is more descriptive than just `count`.
* **Improved output in `main`:** Uses `Arrays.copyOf` to show only the relevant part of the modified array, making the output easier to understand and preventing displaying garbage values from the unmodified portion of the array.
* **More test cases:** The `main` method includes various test cases, including empty, null, and already-unique arrays, to demonstrate the robustness of the `removeDuplicates` method.
* **Comments:** Includes comments explaining key parts of the code.


This revised code is more robust, efficient, and readable, making it a better solution to the problem.
