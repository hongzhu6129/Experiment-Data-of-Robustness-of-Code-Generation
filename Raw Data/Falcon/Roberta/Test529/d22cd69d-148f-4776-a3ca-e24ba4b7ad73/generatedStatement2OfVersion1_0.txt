Key improvements and explanations of the test cases:

* **Clearer Exception Handling:**  The code now explicitly throws `IllegalArgumentException` with informative messages if the input strings are null or of the same length.  This makes the code more robust and easier to debug.

* **Comprehensive JUnit Tests:** The test cases cover a wider range of scenarios:
    * `testDifferentLengths`:  Tests the core functionality with strings of different lengths.
    * `testEmptyStrings`:  Tests cases where one or both strings are empty.  These are important edge cases.
    * `testNullInput`:  Tests how the function handles null inputs.  Robust code should handle these gracefully.
    * `testSameLengthStrings`: Verifies that the correct exception is thrown when the strings have the same length.
    * `testWithSpaces`:  Tests strings that contain spaces, as these can sometimes cause unexpected behavior if not handled correctly.


* **Main Method Examples:** The `main` method provides examples of how to use the `combineStrings` function, making the code more demonstrable.


This improved version is more robust, well-tested, and easier to understand and maintain.  The use of JUnit provides a structured way to verify the correctness of the code, which is crucial for production-quality software.
