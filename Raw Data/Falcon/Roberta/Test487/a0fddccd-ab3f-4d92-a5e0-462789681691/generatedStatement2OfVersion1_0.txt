This code will output the American flag pattern as specified in your question, with the correct alignment of stars and stripes. Key improvements:

* **Clearer formatting:** Consistent use of spaces and comments makes the code easier to read and understand.
* **Correct spacing:** The spacing between the star field and the stripes section is now accurate.
* **Correct number of stars and stripes:**  The code ensures the right number of rows of stars (alternating 6 and 5 stars) and total rows of stripes.


This updated version directly addresses the issues of the original pattern by using simpler looping logic and string formatting.  It provides a clean and accurate output of the desired American flag.
