Key improvements:

- **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles cases where the input array is `null` or empty, when `k` is larger than the array size, and when `k` is non-positive.  It prints appropriate messages to the user.
- **Min-Heap Approach:** The most efficient approach (using a `PriorityQueue` as a min-heap) has been added. This is generally the preferred way to find the k largest elements, especially for large datasets.
- **Sorting Approach (for illustration):** The sorting approach is kept for illustrative purposes (easier to understand) but there's a comment explaining that the min-heap approach is generally more efficient.
- **Clearer output:**  The output now clearly labels which method was used and prints the result in a more readable format.
- **More Comprehensive Examples:**  Added examples in `main` to demonstrate the various edge cases and the correct handling of them.


This revised version is much more robust and efficient than the previous one and demonstrates the best practice for this kind of problem.
