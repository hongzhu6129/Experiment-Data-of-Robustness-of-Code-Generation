Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Min-Heap Approach (Efficient):**  Uses a `PriorityQueue` (which is a min-heap implementation in Java) to keep track of the `k` largest elements seen so far.  This has a time complexity of O(n log k), where n is the array size.

2. **Sorting Approach (For comparison):**  Includes a sorting method for demonstration.  While simpler to understand initially, sorting is less efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n).

3. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly indicates which method was used to find the k largest elements (Min-Heap or Sorting).  This improves readability.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:** Added handling for empty input arrays and when `k` is larger than the array size or `k` is not positive to prevent errors.  This makes the code more robust.

5. **Comprehensive Example Usage:** The `main` method now demonstrates the function with multiple examples, including edge cases, to show how it behaves in different situations.

6. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic, especially for the Min-Heap approach, making the code easier to understand.



This revised version is more efficient, robust, and easier to understand, making it a better solution overall.
