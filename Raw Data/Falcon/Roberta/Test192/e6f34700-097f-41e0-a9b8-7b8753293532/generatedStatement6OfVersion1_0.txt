This will print the two approximations of pi to the console.


**Educational Aspects:**

This program demonstrates:

* **The Leibniz formula for pi:** A simple way to approximate pi using an infinite series.
* **The concept of infinite series:**  How an infinite series can converge to a specific value.
* **The importance of data types in programming:** The use of `double` to ensure accurate floating-point calculations.
* **How the accuracy of the approximation improves with more terms:**  You can observe this by comparing the two results.


This revised answer is clearer, more accurate, and better suited for educational purposes.
