This improved version includes:

1. **More Examples:** Demonstrates addition with different numbers, including negative numbers, to showcase the generality of the method.
2. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**  Breaks down the logic with a simple example (2 + 3), showing the binary operations and their decimal equivalents at each step. This significantly improves the educational value.
3. **Clearer Comments:**  Provides comments throughout the code to explain the purpose of each bitwise operation.
4. **Output Formatting:**  Uses `println` statements to structure the output, making it easier to follow the examples and explanations.
