**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling (NumberFormatException):** The code now includes `try-catch` blocks to handle `NumberFormatException`. This is crucial because if the input string cannot be parsed into the desired numeric type, the program will crash without it. The `try-catch` prevents this and allows you to handle the error gracefully (e.g., print an error message).

2. **Demonstrates long conversion:** Shows how to convert to `long` which is important for numbers larger than the maximum value an `int` can hold.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output is more descriptive, indicating the type of each converted value.

4. **Helper Method Example:** The `convertAndPrintInt` method demonstrates how you could encapsulate the conversion and error handling logic within a separate method within your `main` method if you need to perform these conversions repeatedly.  This improves code organization.

5. **Handles Invalid Input Demonstrated:** Shows how the error handling works with specific invalid input examples (e.g., "abc", "123.45" for int conversion).


This revised version is much more robust and practical because it addresses the very important issue of handling invalid input, making it less prone to errors.
