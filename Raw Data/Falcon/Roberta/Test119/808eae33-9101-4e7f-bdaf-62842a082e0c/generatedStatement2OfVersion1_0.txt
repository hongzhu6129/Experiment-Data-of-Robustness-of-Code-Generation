Explanation:

1. **Get a Calendar Instance:** `Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar();` creates a `Calendar` object representing the current date and time.
2. **`getActualMinimum()`:**  The `getActualMinimum()` method is used to get the lowest possible value for a particular field (e.g., YEAR, MONTH) in the given calendar system.  
3. **Field Constants:**  `Calendar.YEAR`, `Calendar.MONTH`, `Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR`, and `Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH` are constants that specify the field we are interested in (year, month, etc.).
4. **Month is 0-indexed:** The `Calendar` class uses 0-based indexing for months (January = 0, February = 1, ..., December = 11).
5. **Output:** The code prints the minimum values.
6. **Demonstration (Setting minimums):** The code also includes a section that demonstrates how to actually *set* the calendar's date to the minimum values for each field. This part is just for illustration and to show how the minimum values can be used in practice.


Important Notes on Week of Year:

The minimum week of year (`Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR`) can be either 1 or possibly 52/53 (especially if the locale's first day of the week is set to Sunday and the year begins on a day very late in the last week of the previous year).  The behavior depends on the calendar's locale and how weeks are defined.  The Java documentation provides more details.
