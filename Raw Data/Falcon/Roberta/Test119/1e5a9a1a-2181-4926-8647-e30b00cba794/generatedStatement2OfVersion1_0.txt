**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using names like `minYear`, `minMonth` improves readability.
2. **Direct Minimum Values:**  The minimum values for year, month, and date are inherently 1. No calculation is necessary.
3. **ISO-8601 Week Handling:**  The code clarifies that "minimum week" depends on how weeks are defined.  It now uses `WeekFields.ISO` to align with the ISO-8601 standard where Monday is the first day of the week, and weeks start on Monday.
4. **Illustrative Example:** The code includes an example of how to get the *actual date* that corresponds to the first week of the year (ISO-8601 standard), showing how to practically use `TemporalAdjusters` and `WeekFields`.
5. **Simplified Week Minimum**:  Since the code uses a standard week definition (ISO-8601), the minimum week number is always 1.
6. **Correct Date/Time Handling**: Uses `LocalDateTime` for the current instant and `LocalDate` when dealing with dates specifically (without time components).



This revised version provides a more accurate, informative, and robust solution to the problem of determining the minimum possible values for year, month, week (according to ISO-8601), and day of the month within a borrower's calendar. It also shows a practical example of finding a date corresponding to the minimum week number.
