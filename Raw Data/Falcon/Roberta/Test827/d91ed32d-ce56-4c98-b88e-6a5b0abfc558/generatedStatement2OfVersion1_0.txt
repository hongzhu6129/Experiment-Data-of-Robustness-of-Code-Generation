Key improvements and explanations in this code:

1. **Uses `TreeMap`:** `TreeMap` is a sorted map implementation, which is essential for efficiently getting a submap based on key ranges.  Other map types like `HashMap` do not maintain order.

2. **`tailMap()` method:** The `tailMap()` method is the correct way to get a portion of the map whose keys are greater than or equal to a given key.  The `false` argument makes it strictly greater than.

3. **Clear Examples:** The code provides multiple examples with different key types (Integer, String) and demonstrates both inclusive and exclusive submaps.

4. **Explanatory Comments:**  Comments clearly explain the code's purpose and how the `tailMap()` method works.

5. **Correct Output:**  The `println` statements show the resulting submaps clearly, making it easy to understand the output.
