**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Saddleback Search:** The `Saddleback` (or sometimes called `staircase search`) method efficiently searches a sorted 2D array. It starts from the top-right corner.  If the current element is smaller than the target, it moves down (to a larger element). If the current element is larger than the target, it moves left (to a smaller element).

2. **Clearer Return:**  The `Saddleback` function returns an `int[]` of size 2.  If the target is found, the array contains the row and column indices.  If the target is *not* found, it returns `{-1, -1}` to clearly indicate failure.

3. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function. It creates a sample matrix, sets a target value, and then calls `Saddleback` to search. The result is printed to the console.

4. **Error Handling:** The `main` method now checks the result from `Saddleback`. If `{-1, -1}` is returned, it prints a message that the target was not found.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SaddlebackSearch.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:
