Explanation and Key Improvements:

1. **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:**  The code strictly adheres to the specified method signatures: `public static void main(String[])` and `private static int[] Saddleback(int[][], int, int, int)`.

2. **Return an `int[]` for Results:** The `Saddleback` function now returns an `int[]` containing the row and column indices of the target. If the element is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`. This makes it easier to handle the search result in `main`.

3. **Enhanced Readability:**  Variables are named more descriptively (e.g., `m`, `n`, `target`), and comments explain the logic within the `Saddleback` function.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to call the `Saddleback` function and interpret the returned array to determine the position of the target element or if it's not found.  It now includes an example looking for a number *not* present in the array.

5. **Efficient Saddleback Search:** The `Saddleback` function correctly implements the saddleback search algorithm, starting from the top-right corner and moving down or left based on the comparison with the target value.  This is much more efficient than a brute-force search on a sorted 2D array.
