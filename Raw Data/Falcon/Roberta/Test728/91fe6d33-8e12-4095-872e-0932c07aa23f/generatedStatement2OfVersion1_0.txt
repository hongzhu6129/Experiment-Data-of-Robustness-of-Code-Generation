Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `formula_1`, `m`, `n`, `target` makes the code easier to understand.

2. **Return an Array:** The `Saddleback` function now returns an `int[]` containing the row and column indices. This is a more standard way to return multiple values in Java.  If the element is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.

3. **Boundary Checks:**  The `while` loop condition now includes `row < m && col >= 0` to prevent going out of bounds.

4. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic more clearly.

5. **Example Usage in `main`:** Demonstrates how to call the `Saddleback` function and handle the result (both for a successful search and an unsuccessful search).


This revised code is much more robust, readable, and follows good Java coding practices. It effectively implements the saddleback search algorithm.
