**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Saddleback Search Implementation:** The `Saddleback` method correctly implements the saddleback search algorithm.  It starts from the top-right corner of the matrix.  It moves left if the current element is greater than the target and moves down if the current element is less than the target.

2. **Return Array:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` of size 2. If the target is found, the array contains the row and column indices (0-based).  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}` to clearly indicate failure.

3. **Clearer Main Method:**  The `main` method now has clearer examples, demonstrating how to use the `Saddleback` method and how to interpret its results. It also includes a test case where the target is not present in the array.


**How Saddleback Search Works with Spiral Ordered Matrices**

A spirally ordered matrix (like the one in the example) has a specific property:  if you start from the top-right corner:
- Elements to the left are smaller.
- Elements below are larger.

This allows the saddleback search to efficiently locate the target by eliminating either a row or a column in each comparison.  It is more efficient than a linear search in such a matrix.
