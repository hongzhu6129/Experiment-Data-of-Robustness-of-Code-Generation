**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Method Signature:** The `Saddleback` method signature now explicitly takes the matrix dimensions `m` and `n`, making the code more readable and less prone to errors.

2. **Returns an Array:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` to represent the row and column index of the target. If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`. This is a more robust way to handle the result than printing directly within the `Saddleback` function.

3. **Improved Main Method:** The `main` method now demonstrates how to call `Saddleback` and interpret its results. It also includes an example where the target is not found.

4. **Concise Comments:** The code is well-commented, explaining the logic behind the saddleback search algorithm.

5. **Error Handling:**  The code now handles the case where the target is not found, returning {-1, -1}. The `main` method then checks this result and prints an appropriate message.


This improved version provides a complete and robust solution to the Saddleback search problem in a 2D sorted matrix. It is well-structured, easy to understand, and follows the requested method signatures.
