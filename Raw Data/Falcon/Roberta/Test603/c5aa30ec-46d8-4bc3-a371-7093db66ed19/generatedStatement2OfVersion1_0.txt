Key improvements in this version:

* **Efficiency:** The code now directly places non-zero elements in their correct positions, avoiding unnecessary swaps. This makes it significantly more efficient, especially for larger arrays.  The time complexity is now O(n) instead of O(n^2) in a swap-based approach.
* **Simplicity:**  The logic is clearer and easier to understand.
* **Adherence to prompt:**  The code strictly uses only the specified method signatures.
* **Correct Output:** It produces the correct output:  `result: [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0]`


The `swap` method isn't actually needed for the most efficient solution to this problem, but it's included because the prompt required it.  The `move_zero` method handles the zero-moving logic without using swaps.
