Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Efficiency with `swap`:** The code now uses the `swap` method effectively.  Instead of repeatedly shifting elements (which is O(n) within the loop), it swaps the non-zero element directly to the next available position at the front of the array. This makes the overall time complexity O(n).

2. **`count` for Tracking:** The `count` variable keeps track of the index where the next non-zero element should be placed.  This eliminates unnecessary swaps or shifts.

3. **Clearer Logic:**  The code's logic is more straightforward.  The loop iterates once, and for each non-zero element, it's swapped to its correct position.

4. **Adherence to Method Signatures:**  The code uses the exact method signatures specified in the prompt.

5. **Correct Output:** The output now matches the desired result: `[3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0]`



This improved version is much more efficient and follows best practices for moving non-zero elements to the front of an array (and implicitly moving zeros to the end).
