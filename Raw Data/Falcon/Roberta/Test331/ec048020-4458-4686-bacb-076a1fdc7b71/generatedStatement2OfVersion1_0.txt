**Key improvements and explanations:**

* **Input Validation:** The code now thoroughly validates inputs, handling null, empty strings, and non-binary characters.  This makes it more robust.
* **BigInteger:** Uses `BigInteger` to handle arbitrarily large binary numbers, preventing potential integer overflows with very large inputs.  This is crucial for correctness with large binary strings.
* **Clear Error Messages:** Provides informative error messages for invalid inputs.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Includes a wider range of test cases, including corner cases like empty strings, null inputs, invalid characters, multiplication by zero, and very large binary numbers.
* **Clear Output:** Prints inputs, expected output, and actual output for each test case, making it easy to debug.
* **Assertions:** Uses `assert` statements to automate the testing process during development.  Remember to disable assertions in production code.


**How to Run the Code:**

1. Save the code as `BinaryMultiplication.java`.
2. Compile: `javac BinaryMultiplication.java`
3. Run: `java BinaryMultiplication`


This improved version addresses the limitations of the previous versions and provides a robust and correct solution for multiplying binary numbers in Java.
