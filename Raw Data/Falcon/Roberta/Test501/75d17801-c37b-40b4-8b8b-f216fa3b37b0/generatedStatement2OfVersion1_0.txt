Key improvements:

* **TreeMap:** Uses a `TreeMap` which is specifically designed for sorted key-value pairs. This is highly efficient for timeline-like data.
* **Clearer Search:**  The search for a value is now much more straightforward. It iterates and finds the corresponding key if the value exists.
* **`floorKey` and `ceilingKey`:** Demonstrates how to use these powerful `TreeMap` methods to find entries at or before/after a given time efficiently.
* **Error Handling:** Includes checks (using `!= null`) to handle cases where the searched-for event or timestamp doesn't exist in the timeline, preventing `NullPointerExceptions`.
* **Informative Output:** Provides helpful output messages indicating the search results or if an event is not found.


This revised code is more efficient, robust, and demonstrates the best practices for working with timeline-like data in Java.
