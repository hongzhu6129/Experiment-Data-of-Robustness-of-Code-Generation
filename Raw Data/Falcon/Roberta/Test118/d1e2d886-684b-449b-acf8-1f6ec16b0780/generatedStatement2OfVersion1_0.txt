This revised code offers multiple ways to concatenate strings within the `main` method, includes error handling for incorrect command-line arguments, and provides clear output labeling each method.  It uses both the `+` operator and the `concat()` method for demonstration.  If you provide two strings as command-line arguments, it will concatenate those. If no arguments are provided, it uses the default "Hello" and " World!" strings. If an incorrect number of arguments is supplied, it prints a helpful message.
