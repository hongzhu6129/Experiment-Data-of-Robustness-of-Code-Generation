Explanation:

1. **Method 1: Using the + operator:**
   - This is the simplest and most common way to concatenate strings in Java. The `+` operator automatically converts the operands to strings if they are not already strings.

2. **Method 2: Using the `concat()` method:**
   - The `String` class provides a `concat()` method that appends the specified string to the end of the current string.

3. **Command-line arguments:**
   - The code now includes an example of how to use command-line arguments.  
   - `args` is a `String` array in `main()` that holds any arguments passed when the program is run from the command line.
   - The `if (args.length == 2)` check ensures that exactly two arguments are provided.  If not, a message is printed to the console.
   - `args[0]` accesses the first argument, and `args[1]` accesses the second. These are then concatenated.


How to run with command-line arguments:

1. **Compile:** `javac StringConcatenation.java`
2. **Run:** `java StringConcatenation "First String" "Second String"`  (Replace with your desired strings).  The double quotes are important, especially if your strings contain spaces.


This improved version provides more complete examples and shows how to handle user input through the command line.
