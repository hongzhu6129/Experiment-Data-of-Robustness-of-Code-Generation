**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Integers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 2. Negative Integers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 3. Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2.0 | 0.0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | Division by zero | Remainder not possible |  // Corner Case
| 6. Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13.0 | 8.0 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0.0 |
| 7. Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000.0 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 8. Small Numbers | 0.001 | 0.002 | 0.003 | -0.001 | 0.000002 | 0.5 | 0.0 |
| 9. Integer and Decimal | 10 | 2.5 | 12.5 | 7.5 | 25.0 | 4.0 | 0.0 |
| 10. Negative Decimal | -10.5 | 2.5 | -8.0 | -13.0 | -26.25 | -4.2 | 0.0 |
| 11.  Zero and Negative| 0 | -5 | -5 | 5 | 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |


**How to run the test cases:**

You would ideally use a testing framework like JUnit to automate these tests.  However, you can manually test by:

1.  **Inputting the values:**  Run the program multiple times, entering the `num1` and `num2` values from the test case table.
2.  **Verifying the output:** Check if the program's output for sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder matches the expected values in the table.  Pay particular attention to the division by zero corner case.


This comprehensive set of test cases helps ensure your `ArithmeticOperations` program handles various inputs correctly, including potential error scenarios. Using a testing framework makes this process more efficient and robust for larger projects.
