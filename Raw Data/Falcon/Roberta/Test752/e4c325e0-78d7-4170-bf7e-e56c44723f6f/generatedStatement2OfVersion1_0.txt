Key improvements:

* **Uses `java.time`:**  The modern `java.time` API (available from Java 8 onwards) is the recommended way to work with dates and times in Java. It's much cleaner and easier to use than older classes like `Date` and `Calendar`.
* **Clear Formatting:** The `DateTimeFormatter` allows you to customize the output format of the date and time.
* **Placeholder Implementations:** The other required method signatures are included with placeholder implementations so the code compiles.  You'll need to replace these with the actual logic for your calendar-related calculations.
* **Example Usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to call the other methods (using example values from the current date/time).  You would replace these with the specific logic you need for your application.
