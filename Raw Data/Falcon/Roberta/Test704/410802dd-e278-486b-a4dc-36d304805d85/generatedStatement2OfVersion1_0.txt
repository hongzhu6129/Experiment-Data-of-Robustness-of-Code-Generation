**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **File Path:**  The `filePath` variable stores the location of your text file.  Make sure to replace `"path/to/your/textfile.txt"` with the actual path.  You can use relative paths (relative to your project's directory) or absolute paths.

2. **Try-with-resources:** The `try (BufferedReader reader = ...)` syntax is called "try-with-resources". It ensures that the `BufferedReader` (and the underlying `FileReader`) is automatically closed, even if an exception occurs. This is crucial for preventing resource leaks.

3. **BufferedReader:** `BufferedReader` reads the file efficiently, buffering the input for better performance.  `FileReader` is used to connect to the file itself.

4. **Reading Line by Line:**  The `reader.readLine()` method reads a single line from the file and returns it as a `String`.  The loop continues until `readLine()` returns `null`, which indicates the end of the file.

5. **Processing each Line:** Inside the loop, you can do whatever you need with the `line` String.  The example prints it to the console.  You could also store the lines in a `List<String>`, process the text, or perform other operations.

6. **Exception Handling:**  The `catch (IOException e)` block handles potential exceptions, such as the file not being found (`FileNotFoundException`) or other I/O errors.  Printing an error message is essential for debugging.


**Using Java NIO (Java 7 and later - Alternative in the commented-out section):**

The alternative code demonstrates using `java.nio.file.Files.readAllLines()`. This approach is generally preferred because:

* **Simpler Exception Handling:**  It handles file closing automatically, and the `try-catch` block is more concise.
* **Performance:** For larger files, it often performs better than the `BufferedReader` approach.
* **Character Encoding:** You can explicitly specify the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8) to avoid encoding issues.




**To run this code:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.java` file (e.g., `ReadTextFile.java`).
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac ReadTextFile.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code: `java ReadTextFile`


Make sure you have a text file at the path you specified in the code.
