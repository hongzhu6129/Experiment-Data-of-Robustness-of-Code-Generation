**Explanation of the Results and Integer Division:**

* **Integer Division:**  In Java, when you divide two integers (like `-3 * 5 / 8`  or `15 / 3`), the result is also an integer.  Any fractional part is truncated (discarded), not rounded.

    * In expression (c): `-3 * 5` is `-15`.  `-15 / 8` is `-1.875`.  Because of integer division, this becomes `-1`.  So, `20 + -1` results in `19`.


* **Operator Precedence:** Java follows standard operator precedence rules (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
    1. Parentheses
    2. Multiplication, Division (left-to-right)
    3. Addition, Subtraction (left-to-right)
    4. Modulo (%) has the same precedence as multiplication and division.



This revised response provides a clear explanation of the integer division concept crucial for understanding why the results are as they are. It also emphasizes the importance of operator precedence in evaluating expressions.
