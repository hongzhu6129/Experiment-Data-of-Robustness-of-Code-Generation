**Explanation:**
The Java program uses the `replaceAll()` method of the `String` class to remove all occurrences of the word "moves" from the input string. The `replaceAll()` method takes two arguments: a regular expression that defines the pattern to be replaced, and the replacement string. In this case, the regular expression is `"moves"`, which matches the word "moves", and the replacement string is an empty string, which replaces the matched word with nothing.

The program reads the input string from the user, removes the word "moves" from the input string, and then prints the output string.
