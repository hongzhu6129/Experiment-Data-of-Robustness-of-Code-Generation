Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct Star and Stripe Pattern:**  Accurately reproduces the alternating pattern of stars and stripes, including the correct number of each.  The 'pct' element is included as per the prompt.
* **Clearer Formatting:** Uses loops to reduce redundancy and improve code readability.  Spacing is consistent.
* **More Efficient:** Avoids unnecessary print statements.



This version meets the requirements specified in the prompt using only the `public static void main(String[] args)` method.  It creates a recognizable representation of an American flag (with the 'pct' addition), handling the complexities of the stars and stripes correctly.
