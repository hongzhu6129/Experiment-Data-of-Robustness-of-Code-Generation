Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling for File Input:**  The code now includes a `try-catch` block to handle `FileNotFoundException`.  This is crucial for robust file processing.  If the file specified by the user doesn't exist, an informative message is printed, and the program exits gracefully.

2. **Command-Line Argument Validation:** The code checks if exactly one command-line argument (the filename) is provided. If not, it prints usage instructions and exits.

3. **Filtering Words Starting with a Letter:** The `if (word.matches("^[a-zA-Z].*"))` condition ensures that only words starting with a letter (a-z or A-Z) are added to the `words` list. This addresses the requirement "the words must start with a letter."  The regular expression `^[a-zA-Z].*` matches any string that begins with a letter and is followed by any characters (or no characters).

4. **Descending Sort:** `Collections.sort(words, Collections.reverseOrder());` sorts the `words` list in descending alphabetical order, as required.

5. **Clearer display Method:** The `display` method is simple and focused on printing a single word.

6. **ArrayList for Dynamic Sizing:** Using an `ArrayList` is more efficient than a fixed-size array because the number of words in the file is not known beforehand.  The `ArrayList` grows dynamically as needed.

7. **Try-with-resources:** The `try (Scanner input = new Scanner(new File(filename)))` ensures that the `Scanner` and the underlying file are closed automatically, even if exceptions occur. This is best practice for resource management.



How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DescendingWords.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:
