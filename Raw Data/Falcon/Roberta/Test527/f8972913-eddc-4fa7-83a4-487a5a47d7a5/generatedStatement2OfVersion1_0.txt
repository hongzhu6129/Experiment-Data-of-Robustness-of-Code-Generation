**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes error handling for incorrect command-line arguments and file not found exceptions.
2. **Filtering Non-Letter Words:** The `if (word.length() > 0 && Character.isLetter(word.charAt(0)))` condition ensures that only words starting with a letter are added to the list.  This addresses the requirement "the words must start with a letter."
3. **Descending Sort:**  `Collections.sort(words, Collections.reverseOrder());` sorts the `ArrayList` in descending order, fulfilling the core requirement.
4. **Clearer Output:** The `display` method now takes a string representing all the words as input. The main method converts the ArrayList to a String before passing it to the display method for printing. This is a slightly modified approach to meet the specific method signature requirements while ensuring the output is easy to read. (Previously, printing the `ArrayList` directly would include brackets and commas, which might not be desired.)


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DescendingWords.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac DescendingWords.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the program with the text file as a command-line argument: `java DescendingWords input.txt` (Replace `input.txt` with the actual name of your text file).
