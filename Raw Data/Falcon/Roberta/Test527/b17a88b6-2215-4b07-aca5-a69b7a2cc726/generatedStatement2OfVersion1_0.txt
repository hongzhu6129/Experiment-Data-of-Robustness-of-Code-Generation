Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes error handling for incorrect command-line arguments and file not found situations, making it more robust.  `System.exit(1)` and `System.exit(2)` are used to indicate different error types, which could be helpful for scripting.

2. **Regular Expression for Word Validation:**  `word.matches("^[a-zA-Z].*")` is used to ensure that only words starting with a letter (a-z or A-Z) are added to the list. This fulfills the requirement "the words must start with a letter."

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** The variable `s` in `display()` is renamed to `word` for better readability.

4. **ArrayList for Dynamic Sizing:**  An `ArrayList` is used to store the words, as it can dynamically grow to accommodate any number of words from the file.

5. **Collections.reverseOrder():**  The `Collections.sort(words, Collections.reverseOrder());` line sorts the `ArrayList` in descending order directly, which is much more efficient than sorting in ascending order and then reversing.

6. **Try-with-resources:** The `Scanner` is used within a try-with-resources block, which ensures that the file is closed automatically, even if exceptions occur.

7. **Comments:** Added comments to explain key parts of the code.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DescendingWords.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then compile it using:  `javac DescendingWords.java`
3. **Run:**  `java DescendingWords <your_text_file.txt>`  Replace `<your_text_file.txt>` with the actual path to your text file.
