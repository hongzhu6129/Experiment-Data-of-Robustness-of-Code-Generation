Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Error Handling:** Includes checks for the correct number of command-line arguments and handles `FileNotFoundException`.  This makes the program more robust.
* **Filtering for Words Starting with Letters:**  Uses a regular expression `^[a-zA-Z].*` to ensure that only words starting with a letter are added to the list.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Uses more descriptive variable names (like `filename` instead of `args[0]`).
* **Descending Sort:** Uses `Collections.reverseOrder()` to directly sort in descending order, simplifying the logic.
* **`display` Method:** Uses the required `display` method to print each word.
* **Try-with-resources:** Uses try-with-resources for the `Scanner` to ensure proper file closing.
