**Test Cases:**

1. **Valid Time Zones:**
    * `UTC`:  Tests the program with the standard Coordinated Universal Time.
    * `America/New_York`: Tests with a different time zone in the western hemisphere.
    * `Asia/Tokyo`: Tests with a time zone in the eastern hemisphere.

2. **Invalid Time Zone:**
    * `InvalidZone`: Tests how the program handles an invalid time zone ID.  It should catch the `ZoneRulesException` and print an error message. This is a **corner case**.

3. **Edge of Second/Millisecond Change:**
    * The loop calling `getCurrentDateAndTime("UTC")` rapidly multiple times tries to increase the chance of capturing the output precisely when the second or millisecond changes. While it's challenging to test this *deterministically*, it highlights the importance of considering these boundary conditions in date/time handling. This tests the robustness of the formatting when values change rapidly.


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **`ZonedDateTime`:**  Uses `ZonedDateTime` to handle time zones correctly. This is crucial for accurate representation across different locations.
* **`ZoneId.of()`:** Uses `ZoneId.of()` to get the `ZoneId` object.  It handles invalid zone IDs by throwing an exception, which we catch.
* **`DateTimeFormatter`:** Uses `DateTimeFormatter` with a specific pattern (`yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.SSS`) for consistent formatting.
* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `DateTimeException` (in case of formatting errors) or `ZoneRulesException` (in case of invalid zone IDs).
* **Clearer Output:**  Prints informative messages to identify each test case.
* **Corner Case Handling:**  Specifically addresses invalid time zones and the edge of a second changing, making the tests more robust.


This improved version is more comprehensive, handles errors gracefully, and uses the correct classes for time zone management. It also provides a set of test cases that cover common scenarios and corner cases.
