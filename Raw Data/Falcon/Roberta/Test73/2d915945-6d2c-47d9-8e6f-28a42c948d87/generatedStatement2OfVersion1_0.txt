To compile and run:

1. Save the code as `LeapYear.java`.
2. Compile: `javac LeapYear.java`
3. Run:  `java LeapYear`  (or `java LeapYear 2020` to test with a specific year from the command line)



The code demonstrates three ways:

1. **Nested `if` statements:** The classic approach to check leap year conditions.
2. **Concise Boolean Logic:** A shorter and more readable way using boolean operators.
3. **Command-line argument:** Shows how to get the year input from the command-line arguments, making the program more flexible. It also includes error handling to catch invalid input (non-integer arguments).
