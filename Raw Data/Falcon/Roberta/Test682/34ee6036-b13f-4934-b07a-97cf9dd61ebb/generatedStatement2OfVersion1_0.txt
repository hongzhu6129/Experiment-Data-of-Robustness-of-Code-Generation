**Explanation:**

1. **`main` method:**
   - Sets up a sample input string `abracadabra`.
   - Calls the `removeSetofCharacters` method with the input string, characters to remove individually ("b"), and the set of characters to remove ("ac").

2. **`removeSetofCharacters` method:**
   - Takes the input string, individual characters to remove, and the character set to remove as arguments.
   - First, it iterates through the `charsToRemove` string.  For each character, it uses `String.replace()` to remove all occurrences of that character from the input string.
   - Next, it uses `String.replace()` again to remove all occurrences of the `setToRemove` string (in this case, "ac") from the modified string.
   - Finally, it prints the resulting string after the removals.
