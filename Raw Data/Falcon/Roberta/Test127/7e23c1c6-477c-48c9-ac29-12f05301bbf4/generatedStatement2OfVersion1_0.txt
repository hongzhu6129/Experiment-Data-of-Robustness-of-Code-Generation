**Explanation:**

This code directly leverages the `System.getProperty()` method within the `main` method.  Since the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) needs to be running to execute any Java code,  the presence and execution of this program itself inherently confirms that Java is installed.  The code then fetches and prints key Java environment properties, further validating the installation and providing details about the specific Java version and configuration.


**How to run it:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CheckJavaInstallation.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:  `javac CheckJavaInstallation.java`
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program with: `java CheckJavaInstallation`


If Java is installed correctly, the output will display the requested information about your Java environment. If Java isn't installed or configured properly, you'll likely encounter an error during the compilation or execution stages.
