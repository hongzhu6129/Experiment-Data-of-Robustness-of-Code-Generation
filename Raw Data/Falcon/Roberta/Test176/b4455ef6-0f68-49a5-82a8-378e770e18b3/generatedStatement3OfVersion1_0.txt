- **Generics:** `<K, V>` makes the method work with any key-value type combination.
- **Null/Empty Check:** The code handles cases where the input `treeMap` is `null` or empty.
- **`lowerKey()`:**  This `TreeMap` method directly returns the greatest key strictly less than the given `key`. If no such key exists, it returns `null`.  This is precisely what the problem statement requires, making the code very concise and efficient.
