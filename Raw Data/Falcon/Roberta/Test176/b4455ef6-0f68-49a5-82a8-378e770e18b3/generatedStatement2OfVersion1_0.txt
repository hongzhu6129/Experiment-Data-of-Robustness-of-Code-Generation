Explanation using main method examples:

1. **Create a TreeMap:** A `TreeMap` is used because it automatically stores keys in sorted order, which makes it efficient to find the greatest key less than a given key.

2. **Populate the TreeMap:**  We add some key-value pairs.  The example demonstrates both Integer and String keys to show the generic nature of the `getGreatestKeyLessThan` method.

3. **Call `getGreatestKeyLessThan`:** The method is called with various test cases to illustrate different scenarios:
   - A key present in the map (e.g., 25).
   - A key that exists in the map, and where we want the immediately lower key (e.g., 10).
   - Keys smaller than any key in the map (e.g., 5).
   - A key greater than any key in the map (e.g., 55).

4. **Print the Results:** The returned key (or `null` if no such key exists) is printed to the console.


The `getGreatestKeyLessThan` Method:

The core logic is extremely simple thanks to the `TreeMap`'s built-in `lowerKey()` method:
