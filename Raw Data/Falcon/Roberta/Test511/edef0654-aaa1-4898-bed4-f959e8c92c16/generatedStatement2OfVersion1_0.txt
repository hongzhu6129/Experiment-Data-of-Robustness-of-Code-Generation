Explanation and improvements in this version:

1. **Clearer Node Class:** The `Node` class is explicitly defined to represent the structure of a binary tree node. This improves code readability and organization.

2. **Recursive `maxDepth()`:** The `maxDepth()` method uses recursion, which is a natural fit for tree traversal problems.  It correctly handles the base case (empty tree) and the recursive step (calculating depth based on subtrees).

3. **Illustrative `main()` Method:** The `main()` method includes two example trees: a more balanced one and a skewed one.  This demonstrates how `maxDepth()` correctly calculates the depth (height) in different scenarios.  Clear output messages make it easy to understand the results.

4. **Conciseness and Efficiency:** The code remains concise while efficiently calculating the maximum depth.  It avoids unnecessary complexity.

5. **Correct Terminology:**  The code now consistently uses the term "depth" which is synonymous with "height" in this context, referring to the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf.  Using consistent language enhances understanding.
