Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Optimized Swap:** The `swap` method now includes a check `if (i != j)`.  This avoids unnecessary swaps when `i` and `j` are the same, improving efficiency slightly.  This is important because in the `move_zero` method, the same index might be passed to `swap` in some cases.

2. **Clearer `move_zero` Logic:**  The code uses a `count` variable to track the index where the next non-zero element should be placed.  This makes the logic more straightforward and readable.  The comments also explain the process.

3. **Correct Output Formatting:** The `main` method now prints the output in the desired format `[3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0]`.


This revised code adheres to the specified method signatures, is more efficient, and provides clearer and more correctly formatted output.
