**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Using `ZonedDateTime`:**  This is the recommended way to handle time zones in modern Java.  It avoids the ambiguities and potential issues of older classes like `Calendar` or `TimeZone`.

2. **`ZoneId.of("America/New_York")`:** This precisely specifies the "America/New_York" time zone, which correctly handles daylight saving time transitions.

3. **`DateTimeFormatter` (Optional):**  While not strictly required, formatting the time output makes it more user-friendly. You can customize the `formatter` to display the date and time in your preferred style.

4. **Clarity and Comments:**  The code includes comments explaining the purpose of each section.

**To Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CurrentTimeInNewYork.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it:
