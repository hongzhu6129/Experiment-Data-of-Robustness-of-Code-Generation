Explanation of improvements:

1. **Clearer Examples:**  The code now includes several varied examples demonstrating how to create `Period` and `Duration` objects using different methods like `ofYears()`, `ofMonths()`, `of()`, `ofDays()`, `ofHours()`, etc.  This makes it easier to understand the various ways these classes can be used.

2. **Output Formatting:** The output is formatted to be more readable, clearly labeling each period and duration. The `periodToYMD()` method helps present the Period data in a consistent way.

3. **Exception Handling:** The added `try-catch` blocks around the `Period.parse()` and `Duration.parse()` methods demonstrate how to handle potential `DateTimeParseException` if the input string is not in the correct ISO-8601 format.  This is crucial for robust code.

4. **Comments and Explanations:** More comments are added to explain the code's purpose and the different parts of the examples.  This makes the code more understandable for learners.


This improved version is more comprehensive, easier to learn from, and handles potential errors, making it a more robust and practical example of working with `Period` and `Duration` in Java.
