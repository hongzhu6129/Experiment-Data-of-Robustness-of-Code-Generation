**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Brute-Force Approach:** The code iterates through numbers, cubing them and checking against the input `number`. This is straightforward but becomes inefficient for very large numbers.

2. **Handling Negative Numbers:**  Cubes of negative numbers are negative.  The code has been updated to correctly handle negative inputs.

3. **Using `Math.abs()`:**  The `Math.abs()` function ensures the code works correctly for both positive and negative inputs.

4. **More Efficient Approach (for larger numbers - not using only `main` as requested but provided for reference):**
