Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Names:** `mid1` and `mid2` are used instead of `m1` and `m2` for better readability.
* **Enhanced Comments:** Comments explaining the logic of each section are added.
* **Test Cases in `main`:** The `main` method now includes test cases to demonstrate how to use the `ternary_search` method and handles both cases where the element is found and not found.
* **Error Handling:**  Returns `-1` if the target element is not found, making the function's behavior more predictable.
* **Corrected Recursive Calls:** The recursive calls to `ternary_search` now correctly adjust the search space based on the comparison with `mid1` and `mid2`.
* **Adherence to prompt**: Uses only the requested method signatures.
