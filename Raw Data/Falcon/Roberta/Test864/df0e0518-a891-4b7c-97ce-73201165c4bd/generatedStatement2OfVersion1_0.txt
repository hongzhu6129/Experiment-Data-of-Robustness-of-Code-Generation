**Test Cases:**

1. **Valid Input:**
   - Input: `side = 5`
   - Expected Output: `The area of the hexagon is: 64.9519052838329`

2. **Zero Side Length:**
   - Input: `side = 0`
   - Expected Output: `Invalid input. Side length must be positive.`

3. **Negative Side Length:**
   - Input: `side = -2`
   - Expected Output: `Invalid input. Side length must be positive.`

4. **Large Side Length:**
   - Input: `side = 1000`
   - Expected Output: `The area of the hexagon is: 2598076.211353316` (Tests for potential overflow issues, though doubles have a wide range)


5. **Small Side Length:**
   - Input: `side = 0.001`
   - Expected Output:  `The area of the hexagon is: 2.598076211353316E-6` (Tests handling of small values).


**How to Run the Test Cases:**

Since all the logic is in the `main` method, the easiest way to test these cases is to:

1. Compile the Java code: `javac HexagonArea.java`
2. Run the compiled code from your terminal: `java HexagonArea`
3. Enter the input values when prompted by the program.


**Important Considerations when not using methods (other than main):**

* **Code Duplication:** If you needed to calculate the hexagon area multiple times in a larger program, you'd have to duplicate the formula, which isn't ideal.  Methods promote reusability and maintainability.
* **Testability:** Testing individual parts of the logic becomes harder.  Methods allow you to isolate and test specific functionalities.
* **Readability:**  As programs grow larger, using only `main` can make the code harder to understand and maintain.  Methods break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units.


While this example fulfills the requirement of using only `main`, in real-world applications, it's highly recommended to use methods for better code structure, reusability, and maintainability.
