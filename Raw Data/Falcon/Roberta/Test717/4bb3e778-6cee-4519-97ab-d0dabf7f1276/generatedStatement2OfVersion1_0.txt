Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Examples:** Demonstrates getting offsets from both `ZonedDateTime` and a fixed offset.  It also shows getting the offset from a  `ZoneId`.  Provides multiple examples with different timezones (Los Angeles, New York, Kolkata).
* **`formatOffset` method improved:**  Handles positive and negative offsets correctly and formats the output in a standard "UTC+HH:MM" or "UTC-HH:MM" format. Uses absolute values to handle minutes and hour formatting to avoid issues with negative signs.
* **Uses `ZonedDateTime`:**  `ZonedDateTime` is the preferred way to work with time zones in modern Java, as it keeps track of both date, time, and time zone information.
* **ISO_DATE_TIME Format:** Uses `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE_TIME` for standardized output.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the code's functionality.


This improved code provides more practical and robust examples of working with zone offsets in Java.
