This code demonstrates three ways to achieve a max priority queue:

1. **`Collections.reverseOrder()`:** The simplest and most recommended way. It uses a pre-built comparator to reverse the natural ordering.

2. **Custom Comparator (Lambda):**  Provides flexibility if you have more complex comparison logic (e.g., comparing objects).

3. **Multiplying by -1:** Works for primitive types but has limitations (overflow potential) and is less efficient than using a comparator directly. It's generally best to avoid this approach.


The examples use `Integer` for clarity, but these methods work with any comparable type (or objects with custom comparators).  The output of each method demonstrates that the elements are retrieved in descending order, confirming the max-heap behavior.
