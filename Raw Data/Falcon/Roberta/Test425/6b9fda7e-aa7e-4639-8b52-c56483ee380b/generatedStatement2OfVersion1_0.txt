Key improvements:

* **Clearer Examples:** Uses ISO 8601 date format (`yyyy-MM-dd`) in the initial example, which sorts correctly as strings without parsing.
* **Handles Different Formats (Advanced):** Includes a demonstration of how to handle different date formats using `java.time.LocalDate` and `DateTimeFormatter`.  This demonstrates how you would  actually parse dates rather than just sort strings that look like dates. This requires a bit more error handling and illustrates how real-world date parsing might be done within a stream.
* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `DateTimeParseException` when parsing different date formats.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic and the limitations of simple string sorting vs. proper date parsing.
