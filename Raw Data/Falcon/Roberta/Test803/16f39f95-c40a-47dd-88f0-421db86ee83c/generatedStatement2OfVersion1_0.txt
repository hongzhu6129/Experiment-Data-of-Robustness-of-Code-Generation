**Test Cases (including corner cases):**

1. **Lower Boundary:**
   - Input Range: 1 to 5  (Checks if the program handles numbers at the start of the range correctly)
   - Expected Output:
     - Divisible by 3: 3
     - Divisible by 5: 5
     - Divisible by both: (none)

2. **Upper Boundary:**
   - Input Range: 95 to 100 (Checks if the program handles numbers at the end of the range correctly)
   - Expected Output:
     - Divisible by 3: 96 99
     - Divisible by 5: 100
     - Divisible by both: 90 (If the range were 90-100)


3. **Range containing multiples of both 3 and 5:**
   - Input Range: 10 to 20
   - Expected Output:
     - Divisible by 3: 12 15 18
     - Divisible by 5: 10 15 20
     - Divisible by both: 15


4. **Empty Range:**
   - Input Range: 101 to 100 (or any range where start > end)
   - Expected Output: Nothing should be printed for each category.  This tests handling of invalid ranges.

5. **Single Number Range:**
   - Input Range: 15 to 15
   - Expected Output:
      - Divisible by 3: 15
      - Divisible by 5: 15
      - Divisible by both: 15


**How to Implement the Test Cases:**

You wouldn't typically hardcode these ranges into the `main` method. A better approach is to create a separate testing class (using a testing framework like JUnit is best practice):
