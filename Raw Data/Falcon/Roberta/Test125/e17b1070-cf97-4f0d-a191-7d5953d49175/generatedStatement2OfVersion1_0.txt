**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clarity and Comments:** The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each section.

2. **Efficiency with `break`:**  The inner loops use `break` statements. Once a common element is found or a match is found when calculating the difference, the inner loop terminates. This avoids unnecessary iterations.

3. **List for Results:** Instead of printing elements one by one, the code collects the common elements and the difference in `ArrayList`s and then prints the lists. This provides a cleaner output.

4. **Example Data:**  Includes example arrays (`arr1`, `arr2`) for demonstration.

5. **Clearer Output:** The `println` statements clearly label the output as "Common elements" and "Elements in arr1 but not in arr2".



This revised answer adheres to the prompt's restrictions (only using `public static void main` and basic loops/arrays), provides efficient logic with `break` statements, and presents the output in a well-organized manner. It also demonstrates how to find both the common elements and the elements present only in the first array.
