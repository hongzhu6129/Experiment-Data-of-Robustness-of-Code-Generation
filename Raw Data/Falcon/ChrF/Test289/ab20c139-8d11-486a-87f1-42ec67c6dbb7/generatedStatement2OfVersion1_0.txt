Explanation:

1. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - This is the entry point of the program.
   - It calls `permutationWithRepeation` with the input string.

2. **`permutationWithRepeation(String str)`:**
   - This method initializes the permutation generation process.
   - It calls `showPermutation` with the original string and an empty prefix.  The empty prefix represents the permutation being built up.

3. **`showPermutation(String str, String prefix)`:**
   - This is the recursive method that generates the permutations.
   - **Base Case:** If the length of the `prefix` equals the length of the original `str`, it means a complete permutation has been formed.  It prints the `prefix` and returns.
   - **Recursive Step:** It iterates through each character of the original `str`. In each iteration, it adds the current character to the `prefix` and makes a recursive call to `showPermutation` with the updated `prefix`. This explores all possible combinations by adding each character of the original string at each position.



Example with "abc":

The code will generate the following output:
