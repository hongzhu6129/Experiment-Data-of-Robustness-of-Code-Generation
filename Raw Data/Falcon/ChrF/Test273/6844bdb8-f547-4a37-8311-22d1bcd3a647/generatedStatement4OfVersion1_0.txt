Key improvements:

* **HashMap for Efficiency:** Using a `HashMap` to store character counts significantly improves the efficiency of finding unique characters compared to nested loops. Lookups in a `HashMap` are typically O(1) on average.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  More descriptive variable names like `charCounts` improve readability.
* **Handles Edge Cases:**  While the problem states there's always a unique character, the code now returns `-1` if, for some reason, no unique character is found. This makes the function more robust.
* **Added Test Cases:** Included additional examples to demonstrate the code's functionality with different string inputs.  This is always good practice.
* **Conciseness:** The code is now more concise and avoids unnecessary steps.
