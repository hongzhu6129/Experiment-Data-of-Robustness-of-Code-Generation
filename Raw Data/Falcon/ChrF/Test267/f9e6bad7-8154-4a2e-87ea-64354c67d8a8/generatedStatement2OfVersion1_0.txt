**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Input (n) | Expected Output | Reason/Description |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 615 | Standard positive single-digit input. |
| 0 | 0 | Zero input. |
| 1 | 121 | Another single-digit test. |
| 9 | 1107 |  Largest single digit. Tests for potential overflow issues (though unlikely with int). |
| -5 | -615 | Negative single-digit input. Check handling of negative numbers. |
| 10 | 1210 | This will not give the desired result as it does not follow the pattern (10, 1010, 101010) as the requirements state to compute n + nn + nnn. |


**How to Run the Tests:**

1. **Manual Testing:**  You can manually input these values when prompted by the program.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):** Using a testing framework like JUnit is a much better approach. Here's a basic example of how you could write JUnit tests for this program:
