Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The original code didn't handle negative perfect cubes correctly. This version uses `Math.abs()` or a dedicated check and negation to address this.

2. **Efficient Perfect Cube Check:** Instead of iterating, we efficiently calculate the cube root using `Math.cbrt()` and then check if cubing the integer part of the cube root gives back the original number. This is mathematically sound and avoids unnecessary loops.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output message matches the prompt's exact wording.

4. **Helper Function:** The `isPerfectCube` function encapsulates the cube-checking logic, making the `main` method cleaner and the code more reusable.

5. **No External Libraries:** The code uses only standard Java libraries (`java.lang.Math`).

6. **Comments and Explanation:**  The code includes comments to explain the logic and improvements.
