Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles empty arrays:** The code now explicitly checks for empty arrays (`arr1.length == 0 || arr2.length == 0`) to avoid `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  Empty arrays should return `false` as they don't have a first or last element to compare.
* **Handles unequal length arrays:**  It also checks `arr1.length != arr2.length` and returns `false` in that case, as you can't meaningfully compare first and last elements if the array lengths are different.
* **Handles single element arrays:** This version correctly compares single-element arrays.
* **Clearer logic and comments:** The code is slightly more concise and has improved comments.
* **Example test cases:** The `main` method now includes various test cases, including empty arrays, unequal length arrays, and single-element arrays, demonstrating the robustness of the solution.


This revised solution addresses the potential issues of the previous versions and provides more comprehensive testing.
