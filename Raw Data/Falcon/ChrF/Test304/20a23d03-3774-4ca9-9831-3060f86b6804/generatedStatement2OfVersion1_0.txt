**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Horner's Method:** The provided calculation ((((0)x+6)x+(-4))x+7)x+(-19) demonstrates Horner's method for polynomial evaluation.  It's efficient because it minimizes the number of multiplications.  The `polyEval` function implements this method directly.

2. **Clearer Coefficient Handling:**  The `main` method now creates a `List<Double>` to store the coefficients in the order they appear in the polynomial (from highest power of x to the constant term). This is more organized than hardcoding them within the evaluation function.

3. **Generality:** The `polyEval` function can now handle polynomials of any degree (not just the example one). You just need to provide the coefficients in the correct order.

4. **Double Precision:** Using `Double` for the coefficients and `double` for the result and `x` ensures that the calculations are done with appropriate precision for floating-point values.


**How to Run:**

1. Save the code as `PolynomialEvaluation.java`.
2. Compile: `javac PolynomialEvaluation.java`
3. Run: `java PolynomialEvaluation`


**Output:**

The program will output:
