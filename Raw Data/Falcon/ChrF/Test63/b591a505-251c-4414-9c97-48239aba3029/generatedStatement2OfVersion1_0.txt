**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code explicitly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays, returning 0 as expected.

2. **Clearer Variable Naming:**  `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `i` or `j` for tracking the placement of unique elements.

3. **Concise Logic:** The core logic within the `for` loop is streamlined for efficiency and readability.

4. **Informative Output in `main`:** The `main` method now includes multiple test cases, including edge cases, and prints both the updated length and the modified array (using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid printing the unmodified portion beyond the unique elements) for better verification.

5. **Efficiency:** The algorithm operates in-place (modifies the original array directly) and has a time complexity of O(n) due to the single pass through the array.  This is optimal for this problem.


This improved version addresses potential issues and provides a more robust and understandable solution for removing duplicates from a sorted array.
