Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueIndex` replaces `j` for better readability.
2. **Comprehensive Comments:** Added JavaDoc-style comments explaining the method's purpose, parameters, and return value, along with examples.
3. **Edge Case Handling:** Includes checks for `null` and empty input arrays.  This makes the code more robust.
4. **Main Method with Examples:**  The `main` method now demonstrates the function with the examples provided in the prompt, and adds a test for an empty array and a null array to show robust handling.
5. **Output Clarity:**  The `main` method uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` and `Arrays.toString` to neatly print the modified array up to the new length, avoiding printing the "garbage" values beyond the unique elements.  It also separates the length and the array display for clarity.
6. **Efficiency:** The core logic remains the same, providing an in-place, O(1) extra memory solution.



This revised version is more robust, readable, and clearly demonstrates the functionality of the `removeDuplicates` method.
