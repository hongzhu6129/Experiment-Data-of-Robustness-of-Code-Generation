**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`prime_cell(int i, int j)`:**
   - This method efficiently checks if `i` and `j` are prime using a loop up to the square root of the number.
   - It returns 0 if both are prime, and 1 otherwise. This simplifies the logic in `main`.

2. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - Creates a 2D boolean array `a` of size `m x m`.
   - Iterates through the array using nested loops.
   - Calls `prime_cell(i, j)` to determine the value of `a[i][j]`.
   - Sets `a[i][j]` to `true` if `prime_cell` returns 1 (meaning at least one of `i` or `j` is not prime).  
   - Prints the array elements.

3. **Clarity and Efficiency:**
   - The code is now more readable and concise.
   - The prime checking is optimized by iterating only up to the square root.
   - The logic in `main` is simplified by using the return value of `prime_cell` directly.
