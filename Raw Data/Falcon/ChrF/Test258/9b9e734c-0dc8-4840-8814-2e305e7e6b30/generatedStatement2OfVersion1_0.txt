Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Method Name:** `countBitsToZeroBasedOnString` is more descriptive.
* **Handles Negative Numbers:** The code now correctly handles negative inputs by using `Integer.toBinaryString()`. This method handles the two's complement representation of negative integers. Note that the output for negatives might vary (31 or 63) depending on JVM/system architecture.
* **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method now includes multiple examples to demonstrate how the function works with different inputs, including 0 and a negative number.  This is important for testing and understanding.
* **Comments and Explanation:** The code is well-commented, explaining the key parts and the expected output for the examples.


This revised version is more robust, clearer, and provides a better demonstration of how the bit counting works.
