This code efficiently retrieves and prints both environment variables and system properties to the console.  It uses a clear format for displaying the information.  Key improvements from earlier versions:

* **Direct listing of properties:** Uses `props.list(System.out)` for simpler, more concise printing of system properties.
* **Clearer output:** Adds a newline between environment variables and system properties for improved readability.
* **Conciseness:** Removes unnecessary comments and simplifies code structure.
* **Uses `format` for output:** Improves the formatting of environment variables, ensuring consistent spacing and clarity.


This version adheres strictly to the requirement of using only the `public static void main(String[] args)` method signature. It is a complete and functional solution.
