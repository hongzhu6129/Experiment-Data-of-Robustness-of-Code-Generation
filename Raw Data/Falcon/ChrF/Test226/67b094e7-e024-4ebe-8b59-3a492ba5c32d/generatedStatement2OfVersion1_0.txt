Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:** The code now explicitly handles empty arrays (`nums.length == 0`) and `null` input.
* **Clearer variable naming:**  `k` is a commonly used variable name in these types of problems, but adding a comment explaining its purpose is helpful.
* **Concise logic:** The core logic of the `removeDuplicates` function is now more streamlined and easier to understand.
* **Informative main method:** The examples in `main` demonstrate the functionality with different inputs, including edge cases, and print the results clearly.  Using `Arrays.copyOfRange` ensures we only print the relevant part of the modified array.
* **Correctly handling null input:** The code explicitly handles `null` input and prints a sensible message.



This revised version is more robust, efficient, and easier for others (and your future self) to understand.
