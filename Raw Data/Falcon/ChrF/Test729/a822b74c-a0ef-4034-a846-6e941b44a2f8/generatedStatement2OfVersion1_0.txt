Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Comments:** Added comprehensive comments explaining the logic of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
* **Efficiency:** Optimized the inner loop to start from `p*p` instead of `2*p`. Numbers less than `p*p` will already have been marked as composite by smaller primes.
* **Correctness:**  Handles the base cases of 0 and 1 correctly (not prime).
* **Returns an Array:** The `generatePrimes` method now returns an `int[]` containing the prime numbers found, making it more reusable.
* **Clear Output:** The `main` method prints the results in a user-friendly format.


This improved version provides a more robust, efficient, and understandable implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes in Java.
