This code adheres strictly to the specified method signatures:

1. **`public static void main(String[] args)`:**  This is the entry point of the program.  It calls the `displayFirst50PentagonalNumbers` method to print the sequence.

2. **`public static int getPentagonalNumber(int n)`:** This method calculates the nth pentagonal number using the formula and returns the result.

3. **`displayFirst50PentagonalNumbers()`:** (Added as instructed by the problem description, even though not explicitly in the original prompt). This helper method loops from 1 to 50, calls `getPentagonalNumber` for each value, and neatly formats the output in rows of 10 numbers.  The `%7d` format specifier ensures that the numbers are aligned nicely, even when they have different numbers of digits.  The `if (i % 10 == 0)` condition controls when a new line is printed.
