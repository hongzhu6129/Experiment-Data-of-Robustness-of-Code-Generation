Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Error Handling:**  The code now includes error handling for invalid input (negative numbers or k outside the valid range for binomial coefficients). It prints an error message and exits gracefully.

2. **Latinisation Coefficient Formula:** The Latinisation coefficient, also known as the "stars and bars" problem (combinations with repetitions), is calculated using the formula C(n+k-1, k). The code now correctly implements this formula.

3. **Optimized Binomial Coefficient Calculation:** The `binomial_Coefficient` function is optimized:
   - It handles edge cases (k=0, k=n) efficiently.
   - It uses the symmetry property C(n, k) = C(n, n-k) to reduce calculations.
   - It calculates the result iteratively to avoid stack overflow issues for large inputs.

4. **User Input:** The `main` method takes user input for `n` and `k` using a `Scanner`.

5. **Clear Output:**  The program prints the Latinisation coefficient in a user-friendly format.

6. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed at the end to release resources.
