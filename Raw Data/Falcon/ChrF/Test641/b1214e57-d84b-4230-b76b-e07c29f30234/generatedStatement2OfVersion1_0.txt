Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes input validation to handle cases where `n` or `k` is negative, printing an appropriate error message.
2. **Efficiency:** The `binomial_Coefficient` method is optimized:
   - It handles the case where `k > n/2` using the property `C(n, k) = C(n, n-k)` to reduce the number of iterations in the loop.
   - The calculation within the loop is done efficiently to avoid potential overflow issues by performing multiplication before division.
3. **Clarity:** The code is more readable with better comments and variable names.
4. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed at the end of the `main` method to release system resources.
