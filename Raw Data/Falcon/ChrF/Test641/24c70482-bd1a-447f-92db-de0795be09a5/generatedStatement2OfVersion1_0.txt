Key improvements:

* **Error Handling:** Includes checks for invalid input (negative `n` or `k`).
* **Efficiency:**  The `k > n / 2` optimization reduces calculations by using the symmetry property of binomial coefficients.
* **Clarity:**  Improved variable names and comments make the code easier to understand.
* **Comparison:** Added the comparison logic to determine which binomial coefficient is larger, smaller or equal.  This fulfills the "part two positive comparison" requirement.
* **Resource Management:** Closes the `Scanner` to release resources.



This improved version is more robust, efficient, and adheres to good coding practices.
