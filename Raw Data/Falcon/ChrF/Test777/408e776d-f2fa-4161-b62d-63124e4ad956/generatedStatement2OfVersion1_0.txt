Key improvements:

* **Handles command-line arguments:**  The user can now optionally provide a year and month as a command-line argument in YYYY-MM format. The program parses this input and displays the information for that month. Error handling is included for invalid input formats.
* **Clearer output:** Uses `getDisplayName` with `TextStyle.FULL` and `Locale.getDefault()` for more user-friendly output (e.g., "January" instead of "JANUARY"). Also, outputs the day of the week for the first day of the month.
* **Helper function:**  The `printMonthInfo` method makes the code more organized and avoids repetition.
* **More robust:** Uses `YearMonth` where appropriate for better date/time handling.
