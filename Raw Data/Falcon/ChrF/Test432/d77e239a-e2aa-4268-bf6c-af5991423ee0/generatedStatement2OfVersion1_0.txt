**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| Negative Numbers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2 | 0 |
| Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Zero as num2 (except division) | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | Division by zero error | Division by zero error |
| Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13 | 8 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0 |
| Large Numbers | 100000 | 5000 | 105000 | 95000 | 500000000 | 20 | 0 |
| Small Numbers | 0.001 | 0.002 | 0.003 | -0.001 | 0.000002 | 0.5 | 0 |
| Integer Overflow (potential issue if using `int` instead of `double`) | Integer.MAX_VALUE | 1 | Overflow  | Overflow | Overflow | Overflow | Overflow|



**Explanation of Corner Cases and How the Code Handles Them:**

* **Division by Zero:** The code explicitly checks for `num2 == 0` before performing division and remainder operations.  If `num2` is zero, it prints an error message instead of crashing.  This is crucial for robustness.
* **Integer Overflow (if using `int`):**  If very large integers are used and the data type is `int`, the arithmetic operations could result in overflow.  The provided code uses `double`, which has a much larger range and is less susceptible to overflow, though it can still occur with extremely large numbers. Note that the table describes overflow behavior assuming the use of `int`; the provided code uses `double`.  If you were to use `int`, you'd need to add overflow checks.
* **Zero as an operand:**  The code correctly handles cases where either `num1` or `num2` (or both) are zero.  Pay particular attention to the remainder operation when `num2` is zero; it's undefined mathematically, so the code's handling of this is important.


This comprehensive set of test cases helps ensure that the `ArithmeticOperations` program works correctly under a variety of conditions, including potentially problematic inputs.  Testing with these cases is essential for good software development practice.
