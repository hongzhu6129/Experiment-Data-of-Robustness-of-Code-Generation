Here are some additional test cases, including corner cases:

* Empty strings: `""`, `""`
* Single-character strings: `"a"`, `"a"`
* Strings that contain the sequence: `"abc"`, `"bc"`
* Strings that do not contain the sequence: `"abc"`, `"abd"`
* Strings that contain the sequence at the beginning: `"abc"`, `"a"`
* Strings that contain the sequence at the end: `"abc"`, `"c"`
