**4. Large Number:**  (Not a true corner case in terms of program behavior, but tests for potential overflow if using smaller data types like `byte` or `short` � which you should *not* do for a multiplication table).

* **Input:** 12345

**5.  Input Mismatch (Non-Integer):**  This is important to handle gracefully. The provided code uses `Scanner.nextInt()`. If the user enters text, it will throw an `InputMismatchException`.  You should enhance the code with error handling for robustness.


**Improved Code with Error Handling:**
