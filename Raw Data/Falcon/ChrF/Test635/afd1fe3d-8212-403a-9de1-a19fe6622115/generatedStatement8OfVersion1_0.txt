**4. Large Integer (to check for potential overflow, though unlikely with multiplication up to 11):**

* **Input:**  2147483647 (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
* **Expected Output:** (Check for correct results or potential overflow exceptions)


**5. Small Integer (similar to large integer test):**

* **Input:** -2147483648 (Integer.MIN_VALUE)
* **Expected Output:** (Check for correct results or potential overflow exceptions)



**How to Run the Tests:**

You can either manually provide these inputs when prompted by the program or (better practice) create a separate test class using a testing framework like JUnit to automate these tests.  JUnit allows you to define expected outputs and compare them to the actual outputs of your `printMultiplicationTable` method, providing a more robust and automated way to test your code.


Example of a JUnit test (you'll need to add the JUnit library to your project):
