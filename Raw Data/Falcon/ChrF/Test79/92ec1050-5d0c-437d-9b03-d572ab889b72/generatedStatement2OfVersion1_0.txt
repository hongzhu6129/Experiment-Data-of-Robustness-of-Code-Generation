**Explanation of the error and the solution:**

The error "invalid literal for int() with base 10: '\r[|'" occurs when you try to convert a string that is not a valid integer representation (in base 10) to an integer using `Integer.parseInt()`. Characters like '\r' (carriage return), '[', and '|' are not valid digits.

This code addresses the issue by:

1. **Reading Input Line by Line:**  It uses a `Scanner` to read the input line by line, handling potential newline characters correctly.

2. **Splitting the Line:**  `line.split("\\s+")` splits each line into parts based on whitespace. This is crucial because if you have multiple potential integers on a single line, you need to process them individually.

3. **Try-Catch Block for Integer Parsing:** The `try-catch` block within the loop attempts to parse each `part` of the line as an integer. If `Integer.parseInt()` throws a `NumberFormatException` (meaning the `part` isn't a valid integer), the `catch` block handles the error gracefully.  You can choose how you want to handle invalid input � print an error message, skip the invalid part, or assign a default value.

4. **Outer Try-Catch for General Errors:** An outer `try-catch` block is included to catch any other potential exceptions that might occur during input or processing.

5. **Finally Block for Scanner Closure:** The `scanner.close()` in the `finally` block ensures that the `Scanner` is closed properly, even if exceptions occur, preventing resource leaks.


**How to use the code:**

1. Save it as a `.java` file (e.g., `Main.java`).
2. Compile it: `javac Main.java`
3. Run it: `java Main`
4. Provide input (containing potentially invalid integers) to the program via the console.  The code will parse valid integers and report the invalid ones.


This improved version is more robust and handles various input scenarios, including those containing invalid integer representations, more effectively.
