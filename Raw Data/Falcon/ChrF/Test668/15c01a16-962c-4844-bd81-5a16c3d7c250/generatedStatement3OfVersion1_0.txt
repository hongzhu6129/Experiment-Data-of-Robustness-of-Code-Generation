**Explanation of Corner Cases and Overflow:**

* **Zero:** Multiplying any number by zero results in zero.
* **Maximum/Minimum Long Values:**  Testing with the largest and smallest possible `long` values is crucial to check how your program handles these boundaries.
* **Overflow:** When the product of two numbers exceeds the maximum or minimum value that a `long` can hold, overflow occurs.  The result wraps around.  This is demonstrated in test cases 9 and 10. It is important to be aware of the possibility of overflow in your program, especially when dealing with large numbers.


By testing these cases, you can be more confident that your `ProductOfTwoNumbers` program works correctly in a variety of situations. Using a testing framework like JUnit makes it much easier to automate these tests and incorporate them into your development workflow.
