**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **TreeNode Class:** A simple `TreeNode` class is defined to represent the nodes of the BST.

2. **`sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums)`:** This is the main public method that takes the sorted array as input. It calls the `creation` helper method to recursively build the tree.

3. **`creation(int[] nums, int start, int end)`:** This recursive helper method does the core work:
   - It handles the base case where `start > end` (no elements left to process).
   - It calculates the middle index `mid` to pick the middle element as the root of the current subtree.  The calculation `mid = start + (end - start) / 2` is preferred to avoid potential integer overflow if `start + end` is a very large number.
   - It creates a new `TreeNode` with the value `nums[mid]`.
   - It recursively calls `creation` for the left and right subtrees using the appropriate subarrays.

4. **`traverseTree(TreeNode root)`:** This method performs a pre-order traversal of the BST to print the node values. You can change this to in-order, post-order, or level-order traversal if needed.

5. **Main Method Example:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `sortedArrayToBST` method and prints the result of a pre-order traversal.

6. **Minimal Height:** The approach of always choosing the middle element as the root at each step ensures that the resulting BST has minimal height (as balanced as possible).
