Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:**  The code strictly adheres to the requested method signatures: `public static void main(String[] args)` and `private static int[] Saddleback(int[][], int, int, int)`.

2. **Saddleback Search Implementation:** The `Saddleback` method correctly implements the saddleback search algorithm.  It starts at the top right corner and efficiently navigates through the sorted matrix.

3. **Return Value:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` containing the row and column indices of the target.  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.  This provides a clear way to handle the case where the target is absent.

4. **Comprehensive Testing in `main`:** The `main` method now includes multiple test cases, demonstrating the search with values present in the matrix, and also with a value that is not present. This verifies the correctness of the `Saddleback` method in various scenarios.

5. **Informative Output:**  The `main` method provides clear output indicating whether the target was found and its location (row and column) if it is present.

6. **Conciseness and Readability:**  The code is well-formatted and uses meaningful variable names, making it easier to understand and maintain.




This improved version addresses all the previous issues and presents a more robust and illustrative solution to the saddleback search problem in Java.
