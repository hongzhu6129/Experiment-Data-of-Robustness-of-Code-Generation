1. **Swapping Seven Variables:**  It initializes seven integer variables (a through g) with different values.  It then uses a `temp` variable to swap their values in a circular manner. The values are printed before and after the swap to demonstrate the change.

2. **Printing a Face:**  It uses `System.out.println()` statements with carefully placed characters to create a simple ASCII art representation of a face.  The output will look like this:
