Explanation within the confines of a single `main` method:

1. **TreeSet:** We use a `TreeSet` because it automatically stores elements in sorted order and provides efficient methods for finding elements based on their values.  It effectively represents our "tree" structure.

2. **Adding Elements:** We add sample integer elements to the `TreeSet`.

3. **ceiling() method:** The crucial part is the `treeSet.ceiling(element)` method. This method returns the least element in the `TreeSet` that is greater than or equal to the given `element`. If no such element exists, it returns `null`.

4. **Output:** We check if `ceiling()` returned `null` and print the result accordingly.  The example code includes multiple test cases to demonstrate different scenarios (element within the tree, element smaller than the smallest in the tree, and element larger than the largest).
