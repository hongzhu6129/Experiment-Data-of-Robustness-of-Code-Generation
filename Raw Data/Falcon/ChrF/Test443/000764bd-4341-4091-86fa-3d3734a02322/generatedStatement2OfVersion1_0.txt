**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Object-Oriented Approach:** The code now uses a `Rectangle` class, which is more organized and reusable.
2. **Input Validation:**  The `printAreaAndPerimeter` method now checks for invalid inputs (zero or negative length/width) and prints an error message. This prevents unexpected calculations or crashes.
3. **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted to clearly label the area and perimeter.
4. **Test Cases:** The `main` method includes several test cases, demonstrating usage with different inputs, including corner cases (zero, negative, and large values).
5. **JUnit Tests:** I've added a separate `RectangleTest` class that uses JUnit 5 to demonstrate how to write unit tests for the `Rectangle` class. This is best practice for robust code.  The tests cover normal cases, and importantly, also test the corner/error cases.  You'd typically run these tests using a testing framework (like in an IDE or with build tools like Maven or Gradle).



**How to Run the JUnit Tests:**

The easiest way to run JUnit tests is within an IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) that has built-in support for JUnit.  If you're using a command-line build tool (Maven or Gradle), these tools also provide ways to run tests.  The specifics will depend on your setup.
