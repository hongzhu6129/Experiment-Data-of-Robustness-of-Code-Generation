Explanation and improvements:

1. **`containsDigit7` helper method:**  This method efficiently checks if a number contains the digit 7 by repeatedly checking the last digit using the modulo operator (%) and integer division (/).

2. **Clearer variable names:**  `count` is used instead of potentially less clear names.

3. **Main method with examples:** The `main` method provides example usage and output for better understanding.

4. **Comments:**  Added comments explaining the purpose of the methods and the logic.


How to compile and run:

1. Save the code as `Solution.java`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Compile: `javac Solution.java`
5. Run: `java Solution`


This improved version addresses the original prompt's requirements while also making the code more readable, efficient, and well-documented.
