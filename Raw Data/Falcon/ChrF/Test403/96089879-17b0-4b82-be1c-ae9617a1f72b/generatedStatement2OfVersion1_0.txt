Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Names and Comments:**  The method `count_nums_not_7` clearly indicates its purpose.  Comments explain the parameters and return values.

2. **Helper Function for Digit Check:**  The `containsDigit7` helper function improves readability and modularity.  It isolates the logic for checking if a number contains the digit 7.

3. **Main Method with Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `count_nums_not_7` method with a few examples, including an edge case to show how it handles numbers containing 7s.  This makes it easier to test and understand the code.

4. **Efficiency:** The core logic is already reasonably efficient for moderate values of `n`.  For extremely large values of `n`, a more mathematically sophisticated approach (using principles of combinatorics and number bases) might be necessary for optimal performance. However, within the constraints of a coding interview or typical problem-solving scenarios, this approach is clear, correct, and efficient enough.
