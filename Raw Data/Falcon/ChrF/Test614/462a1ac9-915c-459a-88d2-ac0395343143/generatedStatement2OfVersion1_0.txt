**Test Cases:**

While this specific program doesn't have complex logic that requires extensive testing, we can still demonstrate good testing practices.  Since the output is fixed, we'll primarily focus on verifying the correct formatting.  The core aspects to test are:

1. **Correct Text:**  Ensure the poem's text is accurate (spelling, capitalization, punctuation).
2. **Correct Indentation:** Validate the use of tabs (`\t`) for proper indentation.
3. **Newlines:** Verify that each line is printed on a separate line using `println()`.


**Conceptual Test Cases (How to approach testing if you had a testing framework):**

* **Test 1: Verify Full Output:** Capture the entire output of `printFormattedTwinkle()` and compare it to the expected string (the correctly formatted poem). This is the most straightforward and comprehensive test.

* **Test 2: Verify Individual Lines:**  Test each line individually.  This can help pinpoint errors if the full output test fails.  For example:
