This improved version provides both built-in `endsWith()` usage and a manual check for demonstration and learning. It also handles command-line arguments so you can test different strings easily:

**To compile and run from the command line:**

1. Save the code as `StringEndsWith.java`.
2. Compile: `javac StringEndsWith.java`
3. Run with arguments:  `java StringEndsWith "This is a test string" "string"`   (Replace with your strings)


**Explanation of the Manual Check:**

The `checkEndsWith()` method iterates through the suffix and compares its characters with the corresponding characters at the end of the main string. It returns `false` if any mismatch is found, otherwise `true`.  This demonstrates the logic behind `endsWith()` without directly using it.
