Key Improvements:

* **Error Handling:**  The code now checks if the element to replace actually exists in the array.  If it doesn't, it prints a message instead of crashing.
* **Clarity:**  Comments explain the steps and purpose of the code.
* **Flexibility:** Shows how to replace just the first occurrence or all occurrences of an element.
* **Modern Java (Optional):** Includes a demonstration of a more concise, functional way to replace all occurrences using Java streams (Java 8 and later).  This is a more elegant way to achieve the same result if your project allows Java 8+.
