This improved version handles:

* **Command-line arguments:**  It takes the file paths as command-line arguments.
* **Error handling:** Uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions`.
* **End-of-file conditions:** Correctly handles cases where one file is shorter than the other.
* **Clear output:** Prints informative messages about the comparison result.
* **Resource management:** Uses try-with-resources to ensure that the file readers are closed properly.


To compile and run:

1. Save the code as `CompareFilesLexicographically.java`.
2. Compile: `javac CompareFilesLexicographically.java`
3. Run: `java CompareFilesLexicographically file1.txt file2.txt` (replace `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` with the actual file paths).
