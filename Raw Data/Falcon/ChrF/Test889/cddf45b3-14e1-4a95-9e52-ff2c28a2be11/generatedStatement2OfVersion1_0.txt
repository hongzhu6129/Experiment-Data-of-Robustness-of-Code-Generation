Explanation of the methods:

1. **`descendingIterator()`:** This is the most efficient way to iterate a `LinkedList` in reverse order.  `LinkedList` has a built-in `descendingIterator()` method that returns an iterator that traverses the list from tail to head.

2. **`size()` and `get()`:**  This approach works for any `List` implementation (including `ArrayList`). You iterate from the last element (index `size() - 1`) down to the first element (index 0).

3. **Creating a new reversed list:**  This method iterates the original list and inserts each element at the *beginning* of a new `LinkedList`. This effectively creates a reversed copy.  The downside is that it requires extra memory for the new list.


Key Improvements:

* **Clarity:** Clearer explanations of each method and why `descendingIterator()` is the most efficient for `LinkedList`.
* **Efficiency:** Emphasized the best approach (`descendingIterator()`) for `LinkedList`.
* **Completeness:** Included multiple common methods to demonstrate different techniques.
* **Output:** Added print statements to show the original and reversed lists, making it easier to understand the output.
