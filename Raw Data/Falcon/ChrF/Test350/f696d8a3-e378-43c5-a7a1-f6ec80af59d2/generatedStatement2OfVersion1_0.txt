Key Improvements and Explanations:

* **JUnit Tests:** The most important addition is the use of JUnit for writing test cases. This makes the code much more robust and reliable. The `@Test` annotation marks the test methods. `assertEquals` is used to assert the expected values.

* **Test Cases:**  The test cases now cover several scenarios, including:
    * **Radius Zero:**  A boundary case where the radius is 0.
    * **Positive Radius:** The provided example with radius 7.5.
    * **Large Radius:** A test with a much larger radius to check for potential overflow or calculation errors.
    * **Very Small Radius:** A corner case to see how the calculations handle extremely small values and to demonstrate how to set a suitable delta for `assertEquals` with very small numbers.



* **Delta for Double Comparisons:** Because floating-point calculations can have very small rounding errors, we don't use `assertEquals` directly with doubles. Instead, we provide a `delta` value as the third argument to `assertEquals`.  This `delta` specifies the tolerance within which the actual and expected values are considered equal.


* **Encapsulation:**  The `Circle` class encapsulates the radius, perimeter, and area calculations, making the code more organized and maintainable.

How to run the JUnit tests:

1. **IDE:** If you are using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you can right-click on the class and select "Run 'CircleCalculations'". The IDE will automatically run the JUnit tests.

2. **Command Line:** You can compile and run the tests from the command line if you have JUnit set up in your classpath:
