4. **Very Large Radius:**
   - Input: radius = 1000000  (or some other large value)
   - Expected Behavior: The program should calculate and print the correct, large perimeter and area. This tests handling of large numbers.


5. **Small Radius:**
   - Input: radius = 0.0001 (or some other small value)
   - Expected Behavior: The program should correctly calculate and print the very small perimeter and area. This tests handling of small numbers and potential precision issues (though `double` should be sufficient for most practical cases).

**How to Run Test Cases (Manually):**

You can run these test cases manually by changing the `radius` value in the `main` method and comparing the output to the expected results.

**How to Implement Automated Tests (Using JUnit - recommended):**

A much better approach for thorough testing is to use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's an example of a JUnit test class:
