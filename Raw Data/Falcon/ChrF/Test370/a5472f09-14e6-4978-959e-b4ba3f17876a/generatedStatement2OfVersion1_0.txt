**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code now uses `Scanner` to take decimal input from the user.
   - A prompt message makes it clear what input is expected.

2. **Binary Conversion:**
   - The most efficient and concise way to convert decimal to binary in Java is using the built-in `Integer.toBinaryString(decimal)` method. This is the recommended approach.
   - I've included a commented-out section demonstrating the manual conversion algorithm (using repeated division and remainder). This is useful for understanding the underlying logic but less efficient than the built-in method.

3. **Output:**
   - The binary equivalent is printed with a clear label.

4. **Resource Management:**
   - The `input.close()` statement is added to release the `Scanner` resource. This is good practice, especially in larger applications.

5. **Handling 0:**
   - The code now explicitly handles the case where the input decimal is 0.



**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DecimalToBinary.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac DecimalToBinary.java`
3. **Run:**  `java DecimalToBinary`


The program will then prompt you to enter a decimal number, and upon entering it, it will output the corresponding binary representation.
