Explanation:

1. **`equalsIgnoreCase()` Method:**  This method is the simplest way to compare strings in Java while ignoring case. It returns `true` if the strings are equal (ignoring case), and `false` otherwise.

2. **Example Usage:** The code demonstrates how to use `equalsIgnoreCase()` with hardcoded strings (`str1`, `str2`, `str3`).

3. **Command-Line Arguments (Optional):** The code also includes an optional section that shows how you can compare strings provided as command-line arguments to your Java program. This is useful if you want to make the comparison dynamic. To use this, compile the code, and then run it from your terminal like this: `java StringCompareIgnoreCase string1 string2`.   Replace `string1` and `string2` with the strings you want to compare.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StringCompareIgnoreCase.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then, compile the code using: `javac StringCompareIgnoreCase.java`
3. **Run:**  Run the compiled code: `java StringCompareIgnoreCase` (or `java StringCompareIgnoreCase string1 string2` to use command-line arguments).
