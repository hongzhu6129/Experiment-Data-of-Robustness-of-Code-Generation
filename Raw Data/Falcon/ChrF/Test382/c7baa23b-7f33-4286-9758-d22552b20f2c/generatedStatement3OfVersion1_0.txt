By using JUnit (or a similar framework), you can automate your testing process, which is crucial for ensuring code quality as your programs become more complex.  You can run these tests directly within your IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse).


Key improvements in this revised answer:

* **Clearer Test Cases:** The table format makes the test cases much easier to understand and execute.
* **Corner Cases Included:** The test cases explicitly cover boundary conditions like `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.
* **JUnit Example:**  Provides a practical demonstration of how to use a testing framework, which is essential for proper software development.  This promotes best practices and makes testing more systematic.
