## Test Cases:

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input 1 | Input 2 | Expected Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 10 |
| Negative Numbers | -5 | -10 | -5 |
| Zero and Positive | 0 | 7 | 7 |
| Zero and Negative | 0 | -3 | 0 |
| Both Zero | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Equal Positive Numbers | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| Equal Negative Numbers | -8 | -8 | -8 |
| Large Positive and Small Negative | 1000 | -1 | 1000 |
| Small Positive and Large Negative | 1 | -1000 | 1 |
| Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE |  2147483647 | -2147483648 | 2147483647 |
| Integer.MIN_VALUE and 0 | -2147483648 | 0 | 0 |



**How to run the test cases:**

1. **Manually:**  You can run the program and enter the input values for each test case one by one, verifying the output against the expected output.
2. **Using JUnit (or other testing framework):**  A more robust approach is to create automated tests using a testing framework like JUnit. This is highly recommended, especially for larger projects.  Here's a simple example using JUnit 5:
