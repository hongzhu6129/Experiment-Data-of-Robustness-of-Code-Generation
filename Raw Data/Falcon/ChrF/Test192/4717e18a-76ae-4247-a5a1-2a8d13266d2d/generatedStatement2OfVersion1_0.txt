Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Output:**  The output now explicitly states that the minimum month is 0-indexed (January = 0) and includes explanatory notes about the week of year.

2. **Illustrative Example:** The code now includes a small example that sets the calendar to January 1st of the current year and gets the week of year.  This demonstrates why the `minWeekOfYear` might not always be 1 (it depends on how the calendar defines the first week of the year).

3. **Added `minDayOfYear`:** For completeness, the code also gets and prints the minimum day of the year.  This will always be 1.

4. **`getActualMinimum()`:**  Uses `getActualMinimum()` which is the correct way to get the minimum value for a field, as it accounts for calendar-specific rules.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `MinimumCalendarValues.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.  Compile using `javac MinimumCalendarValues.java`.
3. **Run:** Run the compiled code using `java MinimumCalendarValues`.
