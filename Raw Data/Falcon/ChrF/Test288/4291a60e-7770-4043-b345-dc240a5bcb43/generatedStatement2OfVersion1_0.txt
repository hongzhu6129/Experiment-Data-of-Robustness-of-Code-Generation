Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  The `sort` method now correctly handles `null` or empty input arrays.
* **Clearer variable names:**  `inputArr` is used instead of just `array` in the `sort` method for better readability.
* **Pivot selection:** Uses the middle element as the pivot to mitigate worst-case scenarios (e.g., already sorted or reverse sorted arrays) somewhat.
* **In-place sorting:** The sorting is done directly on the input array without creating temporary copies, saving memory.
* **Recursive calls:** The recursive calls to `quickSort` now use `j` and `i` correctly to divide the subarrays.
* **Output:** The `main` method now prints the sorted array to the console for easy verification.


This improved code provides a robust and efficient implementation of Quicksort in Java, adhering to the specified method signatures.
