Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The `sort` method now explicitly handles `null` and empty input arrays, preventing potential `NullPointerException` errors.
2. **Clearer Pivot Selection:**  The pivot is calculated using `lowerIndex + (higherIndex - lowerIndex) / 2` to prevent potential integer overflow issues that could occur with `(lowerIndex + higherIndex) / 2`. This is especially important when dealing with very large arrays.
3. **Recursive Calls Optimized:** The recursive calls to `quickSort` are now guarded by checks (`lowerIndex < j` and `i < higherIndex`) to avoid unnecessary recursive calls when the sub-array is already sorted or has only one element.
4. **`exchangeNumbers` takes the array:** The `exchangeNumbers` method now takes the array as a parameter, making the code more modular and reusable. It swaps elements within the given array.  This was a major structural issue in the previous versions.
5. **Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method includes more comprehensive test cases: empty array, null array, and an already sorted array. This helps ensure the code is robust and handles various scenarios correctly.
6. **Comments and Readability:**  Improved commenting makes the code easier to understand and maintain. The logic for partitioning and recursive calls is explained clearly.





This revised version addresses the previous issues and provides a more robust and efficient implementation of QuickSort.
