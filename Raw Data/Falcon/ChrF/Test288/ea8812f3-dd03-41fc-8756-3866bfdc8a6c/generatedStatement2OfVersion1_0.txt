Key improvements in this version:

* **Pivot Selection:** Uses the middle element as the pivot to mitigate worst-case scenarios (e.g., already sorted or reverse sorted arrays).  `int pivot = array[lowerIndex+(higherIndex-lowerIndex)/2];`
* **Handles Empty/Null Input:**  Includes a check at the start of `sort()` to gracefully handle these cases.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `lowerIndex` and `higherIndex` are more descriptive than `low` and `high`.
* **Comments:**  Explains the logic more thoroughly.
* **Output:**  Prints the sorted array to the console using `Arrays.toString()` for easy verification.
