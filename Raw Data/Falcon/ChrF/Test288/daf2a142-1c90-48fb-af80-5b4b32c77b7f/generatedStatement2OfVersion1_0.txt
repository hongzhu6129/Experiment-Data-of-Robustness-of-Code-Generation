Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:** The `sort` method now correctly handles null or empty input arrays.
* **Clearer pivot selection:** The pivot is calculated using `lowerIndex+(higherIndex-lowerIndex)/2` which avoids potential overflow issues that could occur with `(lowerIndex + higherIndex)/2` for very large indices.
* **Correct partitioning:** The `while (i <= j)` loop ensures correct partitioning around the pivot.
* **Recursive calls:** The recursive calls to `quickSort` are made only when necessary, preventing infinite recursion.
* **Added output:** The `main` method now prints the sorted array to the console for easy verification.
* **Improved commenting:**  Comments explain the logic more clearly.



This revised code provides a robust and efficient implementation of QuickSort in Java adhering to the specified method signatures.
