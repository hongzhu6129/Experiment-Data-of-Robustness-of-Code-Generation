Key changes and explanations:

1. **Corrected Signs:** The original prompt had some incorrect signs in the series. The Leibniz formula for pi alternates signs:  1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...  The code is now corrected to reflect this.

2. **Use of 1.0:**  As requested, all integer values are explicitly written as floating-point values (e.g., `1.0` instead of `1`). This ensures that floating-point division is performed, giving a more accurate result.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly labels each approximation to make it easier to understand the results.


This revised code accurately calculates the two approximations of pi using the Leibniz formula.
