Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `j`.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles empty (`nums.length == 0`) and null (`nums == null`) input arrays, returning 0 as appropriate.

3. **In-Place Modification:** The function modifies the original `nums` array directly (in-place) as requested by the problem, moving the unique elements to the beginning of the array.

4. **Correct Return Value:** It returns the correct new length of the array after removing duplicates (the number of unique elements).

5. **Comprehensive Testing in `main()`:** The `main` method includes several test cases, including examples from the prompt and edge cases (empty and null arrays) to demonstrate the function's correctness.

6. **Output Clarity:** The `main` method now prints the updated array (only the relevant part after removing duplicates) using `Arrays.copyOfRange()` along with the new length, making the output easier to understand.  This makes it very clear what part of the original array now contains the unique elements.

7. **Javadoc Comments:** Added Javadoc comments to the `removeDuplicates` method to explain its purpose, parameters, and return value.  Good documentation is always important!
