Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueIndex` instead of just `i` for the index tracking unique elements improves readability.

2. **Handles Empty/Null Input:**  The code now explicitly handles cases where the input array is `null` or empty.  This makes it more robust.

3. **Improved Comments:** More descriptive comments explain the logic and purpose of the code.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases in `main`:** The `main` method includes more examples, including edge cases like empty and `null` input, demonstrating how `removeDuplicates` behaves in various situations.

5. **Output formatting in `main`:** The `main` method has better output formatting to visually distinguish the new length from the modified array, making it easier to understand the result.  It also uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` so we print only the relevant part of the array after removing duplicates.


This revised version is more robust, readable, and provides clearer demonstrations of how to use the `removeDuplicates` method.
