Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  Includes checks for `null` and empty input arrays.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` makes the purpose more obvious.
- **In-place modification:** Modifies the original array directly as requested.
- **Comprehensive `main` method:** Demonstrates the function with multiple test cases, including edge cases (empty and null arrays), and prints the updated array contents (up to the new length).
- **Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`:** Ensures that only the relevant part of the modified array (up to the new length) is printed, avoiding displaying the "garbage" values that remain after the unique elements.



This revised code provides a complete and robust solution to the problem while adhering to the given method signature restrictions.
