Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Names:** `Linear_Search` follows the prompt's requirement, but more conventional Java naming would be `linearSearch`.  I've kept the requested name but would advise using `linearSearch` in real-world code for consistency.
2. **Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method now includes a `testLinearSearch` helper method and several test cases to demonstrate that the linear search works correctly in various scenarios (target at the beginning, end, not present, empty array, single-element array).
3. **Informative Output:** The output now specifies whether the element was found and its index, or that it was not found.
4. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code correctly handles an empty array without errors.



This revised version is more robust, easier to understand, and demonstrates good testing practices.  Remember that thorough testing is crucial for ensuring your code works as intended in all situations.
