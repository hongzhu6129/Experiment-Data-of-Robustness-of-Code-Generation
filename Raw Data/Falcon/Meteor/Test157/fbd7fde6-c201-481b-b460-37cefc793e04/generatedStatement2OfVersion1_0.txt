Key improvements in this version:

* **Try-with-resources:** Uses try-with-resources to ensure that the `FileWriter` and `FileReader` (and their associated `BufferedWriter` and `BufferedReader`) are automatically closed, even if exceptions occur. This is crucial for proper file handling.
* **Clearer error handling:** Provides more informative error messages using `System.err` for error output.
* **Combined writing and reading:** Demonstrates both writing to and reading from the file in a single program.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the code.
* **`\n` for newlines:** Uses `\n` (newline character) for proper line breaks in the output file.
* **Consistent naming:** Uses a consistent naming convention for variables (e.g., `fileName`).


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `TextFileReadWrite.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:  `javac TextFileReadWrite.java`
3. **Run:**  Run the compiled code using: `java TextFileReadWrite`


This will create (or overwrite) a file named `mytextfile.txt` in the same directory, write some text to it, and then read and print the contents of the file to the console.
