To compile and run this code:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `EvenOddCounter.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run `javac EvenOddCounter.java`.
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code with `java EvenOddCounter`  or, to provide numbers as command line arguments:  `java EvenOddCounter 1 2 3 4 5` (replace 1 2 3 4 5 with your desired numbers).


Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles user input:**  It now accepts command-line arguments and processes them as the input array.  This demonstrates a more flexible way of providing data to the program.  (Note:  In a full application, you would add error handling to deal with invalid inputs like non-numeric arguments.)
* **Clearer output:** The output now distinguishes between the results from the example array and the results from user-provided input.
* **Maintains core simplicity:**  It still fulfills the requirement of using only `void main(String[] args)`.
