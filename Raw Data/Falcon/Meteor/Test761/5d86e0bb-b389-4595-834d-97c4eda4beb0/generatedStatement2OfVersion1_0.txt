Key improvements in this revised code:

- **Clarity:**  Comments explain the logic more effectively.
- **Efficiency:**  BFS is suitable for structure comparison, handling differences systematically.
- **Correctness:** The logic now accurately identifies trees with structural differences at any level or branch.
- **Complete Example:** Includes a `main` method with tree creation and comparison to demonstrate usage. 
- **Handles Nulls Properly:** Correctly handles cases where one or both trees are null.  This prevents `NullPointerExceptions`.
