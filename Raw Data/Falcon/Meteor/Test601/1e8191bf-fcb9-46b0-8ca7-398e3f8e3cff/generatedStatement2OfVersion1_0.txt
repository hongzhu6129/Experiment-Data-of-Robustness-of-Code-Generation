**Explanation:**

1. **`main` Method:**
   - Takes a string as input (hardcoded in this example for simplicity, but could be modified to take user input).
   - Calls the `permutationWithRepeation` method to start the permutation process.

2. **`permutationWithRepeation` Method:**
   - Initializes the recursive process by calling `showPermutation` with the input string and an empty prefix.

3. **`showPermutation` Method (Recursive):**
   - **Base Case:** If the length of the `prefix` equals the length of the original string (`str`), it means a complete permutation has been formed. Print the `prefix` and return.
   - **Recursive Step:** Iterates through each character of the input string (`str`).
   - For each character, it recursively calls `showPermutation` with:
     - The same input string (`str`) � ensuring characters can be repeated.
     - An updated `prefix` � appending the current character to the existing `prefix`.  This builds up the permutation one character at a time.



**Example Output (for input "ab"):**
