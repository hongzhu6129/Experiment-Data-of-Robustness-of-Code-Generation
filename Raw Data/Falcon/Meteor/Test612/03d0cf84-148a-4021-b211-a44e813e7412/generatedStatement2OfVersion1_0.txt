Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Pivot Selection:** The pivot is now explicitly calculated as the middle element using `array[lowerIndex + (higherIndex - lowerIndex) / 2]`. This prevents potential integer overflow issues that could occur with `(lowerIndex + higherIndex) / 2` for very large arrays.
* **Concise Comments:**  Comments are more focused and explain the crucial parts of the partitioning logic.
* **Example Usages in `main`:** The `main` method now includes two example arrays to demonstrate the sorting functionality. The output is also provided in the comments.
* **Correct Partitioning Logic:** The core partitioning logic inside the `while (i <= j)` loop is now more robust and handles various input scenarios correctly.





This revised code adheres to the requested method signatures and effectively implements the Quick Sort algorithm. It's also well-commented and includes illustrative examples.
