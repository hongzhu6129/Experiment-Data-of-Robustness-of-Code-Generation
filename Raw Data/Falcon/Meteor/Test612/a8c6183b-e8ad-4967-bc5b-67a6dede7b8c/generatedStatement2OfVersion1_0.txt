Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Checks for `null` or empty input array.
* **Clearer pivot selection:** Uses the middle element as the pivot to mitigate worst-case scenarios with already sorted or reverse-sorted inputs.  `(lowerIndex + higherIndex) / 2`  can potentially overflow for very large arrays, so  `lowerIndex + (higherIndex - lowerIndex) / 2` is safer.
* **Correct partitioning logic:** Ensures elements are correctly partitioned around the pivot.
* **Recursive calls:**  Makes the recursive calls to `quickSort` only when necessary.
* **Added comments:** Explains the logic more clearly.
* **Output:** Prints the sorted array to the console for verification.


This revised code provides a robust and efficient implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm adhering to the specified method signatures.
