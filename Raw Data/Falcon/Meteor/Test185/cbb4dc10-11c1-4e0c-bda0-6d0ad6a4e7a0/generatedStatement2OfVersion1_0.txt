**Test Cases:**

**1. Basic Cases:**

* **Input Range:** 1 to 100 (as specified)
* **Expected Output:**  Verify that the program correctly prints numbers divisible by 3, 5, and both within this range.  For example, it should print 15, 30, 45, etc., for numbers divisible by both.

**2. Corner Cases:**

* **Input Range Start at 0:**  Change the loop to start from `i = 0`.  This tests how the program handles the divisibility of 0.  0 is divisible by all integers (except 0 itself), so it should be printed in all three lists.

* **Input Range Ending at a Non-Multiple:** Change the loop to end at, say, 103.  This ensures the logic correctly handles the upper bound of the range.

* **Negative Numbers:**  While the question specifies 1 to 100,  it's good practice to test with negative numbers. Change the loop to `i = -10` to `i = 10`.  Observe that negative numbers divisible by 3, 5, or both will be correctly identified (e.g., -9, -15).

* **Large Range:** (Performance, though not a strict "corner case") Test with a much larger range, such as 1 to 10000, to see if the program performs efficiently.  (It should, as the algorithm is simple).

**3. Empty Range:**

* **Start Greater Than End:**  Set the loop to `i = 101` to `i = 100`.  The program should not print anything, as the loop will not execute.  This tests handling of empty ranges.

**How to Run Tests (Example):**

You can modify the `main` method of the Java program temporarily to test these cases. For example, to test the range starting at 0:
