Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  Includes explicit checks for `null` and empty input arrays.
* **Clearer variable naming:**  `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `j`.
* **In-place modification:** The code directly modifies the original array as requested by the problem description.
* **Comprehensive `main` method:** Includes multiple test cases including empty and null array demonstrating the robustness of the `removeDuplicates` method.
* **Prints updated array:** The `main` method now prints the updated array after duplicate removal (using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid printing the unmodified portion), making it easier to verify the correct functionality.
