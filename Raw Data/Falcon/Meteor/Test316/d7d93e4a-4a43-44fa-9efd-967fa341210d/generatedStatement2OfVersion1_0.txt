Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Corrected Formula:** The formula in the prompt had a couple of `+` signs where there should have been `-` signs for the Leibniz formula to work correctly. This is now corrected.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `piApproximation1` and `piApproximation2` makes it more obvious what the variables represent.

3. **Explicit Double Literals:**  Using `1.0`, `3.0`, etc. ensures that floating-point division is performed.

4. **Output Statements:** The code now prints the results with clear labels, making it easier to understand the output.

5. **Removed Unnecessary Code:** The original response had some unnecessary code which has been removed to make it cleaner and more efficient.

This improved code calculates the approximations of pi according to the Leibniz formula with the specified number of terms and presents the results in a clear and understandable manner.
