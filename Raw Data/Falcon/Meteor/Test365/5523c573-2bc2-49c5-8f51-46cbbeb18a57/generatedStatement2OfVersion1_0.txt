**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner cases, to thoroughly test the program:

1. **Valid Input:**
   - Diagonal: 5, Side: 3  (Expected Area: 12, Perimeter: 16)
   - Diagonal: 10, Side: 6 (Expected Area: 48, Perimeter: 32)
   - Diagonal: 13, Side: 5 (Expected Area: 60, Perimeter: 36)

2. **Corner Cases:**
   - Diagonal: 5, Side: 4 (Almost a square, Expected Area: 12, Perimeter: 16) 
   - Diagonal: 5, Side: 0 (Invalid input- zero side)
   - Diagonal: 0, Side: 3 (Invalid input- zero diagonal)
   - Diagonal: 5, Side: 5 (Invalid input - side equals diagonal)
   - Diagonal: 5, Side: 6 (Invalid input - side greater than diagonal)
   - Diagonal: -5, Side: 3 (Invalid input - Negative diagonal)
   - Diagonal: 5, Side: -3 (Invalid input - Negative side)

**How to Run Test Cases:**

You can either manually enter these values when prompted by the program or, for more automated testing, you could write a separate testing class (using JUnit or TestNG, for example) that calls the calculation methods with these inputs and asserts that the outputs match the expected values.


**Important Note:** This program assumes you are dealing with a *rectangle*. If you're working with other polygons, the calculations for area and perimeter will be different and you'll need more input (like other sides or angles).
