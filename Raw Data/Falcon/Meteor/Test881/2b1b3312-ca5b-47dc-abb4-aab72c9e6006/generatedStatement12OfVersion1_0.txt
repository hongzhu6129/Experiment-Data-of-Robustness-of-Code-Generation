6. **Integer.MAX_VALUE** (Edge case � check for overflow)
   - Input: `2147483647`  (Maximum positive integer)
   - Observe the results. Very large numbers will result in arithmetic overflow (the number wraps around to a negative value). This is expected behavior with integer arithmetic.

7. **Integer.MIN_VALUE** (Edge case � check for overflow)
   - Input: `-2147483648` (Minimum negative integer)
   - Observe the results, looking specifically for overflow.  Like the positive maximum integer, multiplying this will likely result in overflow.



By testing with these cases, you can ensure that the `printMultiplicationTable` function works correctly for a wide range of inputs, including those that might cause issues due to overflow or special handling required for zero.
