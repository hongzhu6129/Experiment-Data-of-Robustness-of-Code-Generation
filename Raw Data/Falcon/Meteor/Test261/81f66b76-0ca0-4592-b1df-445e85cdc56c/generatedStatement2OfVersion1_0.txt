Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles Nulls:**  It checks if the environment variable exists before printing its value, preventing `NullPointerExceptions`.  This is good practice because environment variables are not guaranteed to be set.
* **Clearer Output:**  It provides a message if an environment variable isn't found, making the output more informative.
* **OS Compatibility Considerations:** Adds a comment about using `TMP` or `USER` as alternatives to `TEMP` and `USERNAME` on some operating systems.  While `TEMP` and `USERNAME` are common, this makes the code a bit more portable.
