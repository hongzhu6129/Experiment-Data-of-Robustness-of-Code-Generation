Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Direct Conversion using `Integer.toOctalString()`:** This is the most straightforward and efficient way to convert to octal.

2. **Manual Conversion (for learning):** The code now demonstrates how to convert manually using a loop and modulo operator.  This helps illustrate the conversion process. It correctly prepends the remainders to build the octal string from right to left.

3. **Clearer Output:**  The output now clearly labels the decimal and octal values.

4. **Example with User Input:** The code includes an example of how to handle user input (from command-line arguments).  It also includes basic error handling using a `try-catch` block to catch potential `NumberFormatException` if the user enters non-numeric input.

5. **Comments:**  More comments are added to explain the code's logic.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DecimalToOctal.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac DecimalToOctal.java`
3. **Run:** `java DecimalToOctal`  (This will use the hardcoded value of 15).
4. **Run with input:** `java DecimalToOctal 77` (This will convert 77 to octal).
