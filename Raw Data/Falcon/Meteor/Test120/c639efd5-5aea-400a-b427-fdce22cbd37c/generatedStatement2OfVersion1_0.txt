**Explanation and Key Concepts:**

1. **String Interning:**  The `intern()` method is the key to getting the canonical representation of a string in Java.  It returns a canonical representation for the string object.  If the string pool already contains a string equal to this `String` object as determined by the `equals(Object)` method, then the string from the pool is returned. Otherwise, this `String` object is added to the pool and a reference to this `String` object is returned.

2. **String Pool (String Constant Pool):** The string pool (part of the "PermGen" in older Java versions, and part of the heap in modern Java (Java 7 onwards)) is a special memory area where unique string literals are stored.  When you create a string using literals (e.g., `String str1 = "hello";`), the JVM first checks if that string already exists in the string pool. If it does, a reference to the existing string is returned. If not, a new string object is created in the pool, and a reference to it is returned.

3. **`new String()`:**  When you use the `new` keyword to create a string (e.g., `String str2 = new String("hello");`), a new string object is *always* created in the heap, regardless of whether an identical string already exists in the string pool.

4. **`==` vs. `equals()`:**  The `==` operator compares *references* (memory addresses).  The `equals()` method compares the *content* of the strings.  This is why `str1 == str2` is likely `false` in the example, but `str1.equals(str2)` would be `true`. After interning `str2`, the references become the same, so `canonicalStr1 == canonicalStr2` is `true`.


This improved example demonstrates how `intern()` ensures that all interned strings with the same content refer to the same object in memory, thus achieving canonicalization.
