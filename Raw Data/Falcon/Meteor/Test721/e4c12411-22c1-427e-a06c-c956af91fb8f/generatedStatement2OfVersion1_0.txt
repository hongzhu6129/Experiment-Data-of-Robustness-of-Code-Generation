Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles Edge Cases:**  Correctly handles `null` and empty arrays.
- **Clearer Variable Naming:** `k` is a more descriptive variable name than just `j` (even though single letter variables are common in these types of problems, clarity is always good when possible).
- **Concise Code:**  The logic remains efficient and avoids unnecessary complexity.
- **Thorough Testing in `main`:**  Includes various test cases (empty array, null array, all unique elements) to demonstrate the robustness of the code.
- **Output Formatting:**  Uses `Arrays.toString(Arrays.copyOfRange(...))` in the `main` method to neatly print only the relevant part of the array after duplicates are removed, avoiding any confusion from unchanged elements after the `k` index.  This makes the output much easier to interpret.
