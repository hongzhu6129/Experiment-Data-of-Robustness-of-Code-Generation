Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Variable Names:**  `lDepth` and `rDepth` are more descriptive than `l` and `r`.
* **Concise Return:** The `return` statement is simplified by using the ternary operator ( `condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`). This makes the code slightly more compact while maintaining readability.
* **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method now includes the creation of a simple binary tree and a call to `maxDepth` to demonstrate how to use the method and print the result.  I've also added an example of a "skewed" tree (which is essentially a linked list) to show how the `maxDepth` handles that case correctly.
* **Comments:**  Comments explain the logic clearly.
* **Class Structure:**  The code is organized into a proper class structure, making it reusable and more organized.
* **Node Class:** A separate `Node` class is used to represent the nodes of the binary tree.  This is standard practice and makes the code cleaner.
