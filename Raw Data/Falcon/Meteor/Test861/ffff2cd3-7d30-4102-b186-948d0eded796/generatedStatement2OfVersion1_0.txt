**Test Cases:**

While there aren't traditional "input" test cases for a simple output program like this, we can think of testing scenarios in a broader sense.  Here's how we might approach testing and validation:

1. **Visual Inspection:**

   * **Basic Test:**  Simply run the program and visually confirm the output matches the expected face. This is the primary test for this kind of program.  Does it look like a face?

2. **Character Encoding:**

   * **Encoding Test:** Ensure your console or output environment correctly supports the characters used (quotes, brackets, dashes, etc.).  If you see garbled characters, it's an encoding issue, not a program logic issue. You might need to adjust your environment's encoding settings.

3. **Output Redirection (for automated testing - optional but good practice):**

   * **Redirection Test:** Redirect the output to a file. This allows for programmatic comparison against an expected output string.
