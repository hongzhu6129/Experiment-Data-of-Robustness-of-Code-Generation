**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`calculateFermatNumber(int n)` Method:** This helper method encapsulates the Fermat number calculation. It takes the integer `n` as input and returns the corresponding Fermat number.  Using a separate method makes the `main` method cleaner and more readable.

2. **Using `long`:** Fermat numbers grow very quickly.  Even though we're only calculating the first 10,  `int` will overflow after the 5th Fermat number (65537). `long` gives us more capacity, although it too will overflow eventually.  For truly large Fermat numbers, you'd need to use `BigInteger`.

3. **Clear Output:** The code now includes a heading "First 10 Fermat Numbers:" to make the output easy to understand.

4. **Efficiency:**  The calculation `Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, n))` can be optimized slightly using bitwise left-shift operations for integer powers of 2.  However, for small values of `n` like these, the difference in performance is likely negligible.  If you needed to work with much larger values of `n` where performance becomes critical, you could incorporate the left-shift optimization.  Here's what that optimized method would look like:
