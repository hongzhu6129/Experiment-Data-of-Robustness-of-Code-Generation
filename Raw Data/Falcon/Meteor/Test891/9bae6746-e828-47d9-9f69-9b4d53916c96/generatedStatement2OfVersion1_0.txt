Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Generics:**  The `getLeastKeyGreaterThanOrEqualTo` method now uses generics `<K, V>` so it can work with TreeMaps of any key and value types, not just Integer and String.
2. **TreeMap's `ceilingKey()`:**  The core logic is simplified by using `treeMap.ceilingKey(key)`. This method directly returns the least key greater than or equal to the given key, or `null` if there's no such key.  This is much cleaner and more efficient than manual iteration.
3. **Clearer Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates usage with both `Integer` keys and `String` keys to illustrate the generic nature of the `getLeastKeyGreaterThanOrEqualTo` method.
4. **Conciseness:** The code is now more concise and focused, directly addressing the problem statement without unnecessary complexity.
5. **Correct Handling of Null:** The code now correctly returns `null` if no key greater than or equal to the given key is present in the TreeMap.


This revised version is the most efficient and idiomatic way to solve this problem in Java, leveraging the built-in functionality of the `TreeMap` class.
