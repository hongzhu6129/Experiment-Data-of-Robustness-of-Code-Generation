   - b) **Output the calculated values:** The formulas will still produce numerical results (perimeter will be negative, area positive).  Document in your program how this case is handled.

4. **Very Large Radius:**
   - Input: `radius = 1e10` (or some other large number)
   - Expected Output:  Check that the results are still calculated correctly and don't cause overflow or other issues.

5. **Very Small Radius:**
   - Input: `radius = 1e-10` (or some other small number)
   - Expected Output: Verify the program handles very small radii without significant loss of precision.

6. **Input Validation:**  Test with non-numeric input (e.g., "abc") to ensure the program handles this gracefully and doesn't crash. You can use a `try-catch` block around `input.nextDouble()` to catch `InputMismatchException`.



**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You can either:

* **Manual Testing:** Input these values directly when prompted by the `Scanner`.
* **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  Create a separate testing class using a testing framework like JUnit.  This is a more robust approach, especially for larger projects. Here's a basic example using JUnit 5:
