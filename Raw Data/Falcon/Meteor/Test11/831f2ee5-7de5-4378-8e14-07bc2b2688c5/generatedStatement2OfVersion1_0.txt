Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes a check to ensure that `k` is within a valid range (1 to the length of the array inclusive).  This prevents `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if `k` is incorrect.  It prints a helpful message to the user.
2. **Clarity:** The output is made clearer by explicitly stating "kth smallest" and "kth largest".
3. **Example Usage in `main`:**  The `main` method now shows how to call the `findKthSmallestLargest` method with sample data and different `k` values, including an example with duplicate elements.
4. **Efficiency:**  The code is efficient for reasonably sized arrays because `Arrays.sort()` uses an optimized sorting algorithm (usually a variant of quicksort or mergesort) that has a time complexity of O(n log n).
5. **Correctness with duplicates:** The sorting approach automatically handles arrays with duplicate elements correctly.  After sorting, if there are duplicates, the kth smallest/largest will still be found at the correct index.
