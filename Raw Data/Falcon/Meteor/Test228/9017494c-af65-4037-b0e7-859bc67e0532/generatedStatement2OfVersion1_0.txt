Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:** Uses more descriptive variable names (i, j) in the loops and adds comments explaining the sections of the flag.
* **Correctness:**  Accurately reproduces the somewhat unusual output including "pct" requested in the prompt.  Adjusts spacing to more closely match the example provided.
* **Efficiency:** Slightly more efficient by avoiding unnecessary calculations inside loops.


This revised code provides a much clearer and more accurate representation of the requested output.  It's still contained within a single `main` method as required.  If you have further modifications you want to make, such as adjusting the number of stars or stripes, or removing the "pct" row, it will be easy to do so in this structured code.
