Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct Star Pattern:**  The stars now alternate correctly on each row, creating the staggered effect of the US flag.
* **Consistent Spacing:** The spacing between stars and the stripes is more consistent.
* **Simplified Logic:** The code is a bit cleaner and easier to follow.
* **"pct" Line addressed:** It is incorporated as a shorter stripe, assuming it's meant to be stars and not a literal "pct." If it was meant to be text, please clarify and I'll adjust.
* **Clearer Structure:** The code is broken into logical sections (stars, "pct" line, stripes).

This version produces an output that is much closer to a representation of the US flag within the constraints of console output.  A real flag obviously has colors, but this captures the basic structure.
