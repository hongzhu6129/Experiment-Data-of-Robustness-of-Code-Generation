Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct Star Pattern:**  The code now accurately places 4 stars in the first six rows and 5 stars in the subsequent 4 rows, reflecting a more typical American flag design.
* **Consistent Spacing:** Improved spacing ensures better alignment of the stars and stripes.
* **Removed 'pct':** The `pct` has been commented out as requested by the prompt.  You can uncomment it if you need it.
* **Clearer Structure:**  The code is divided into sections for the starred section and the striped-only section, making it easier to understand and modify.
* **Simplified Loops:** Uses clearer loop structures to manage the printing.


This revised code provides a much better representation of the American flag within the constraints of the `main` method only.
