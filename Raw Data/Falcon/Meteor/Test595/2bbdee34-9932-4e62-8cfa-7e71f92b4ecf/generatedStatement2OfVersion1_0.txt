This educational example demonstrates several ways to search within a TreeMap:

1. **`containsKey()`:**  Checks if a specific key exists in the TreeMap.  Efficient for simple existence checks.
2. **`get()`:** Retrieves the value associated with a key. Returns `null` if the key is not present. This is a common way to both check for the presence of a key and get its value.
3. **`subMap()`:** Creates a view of a portion of the TreeMap within a specified key range (inclusive start, exclusive end in the example). This is useful when you need to work with a subset of the TreeMap's data based on key ranges.
4. **`floorKey()` and `ceilingKey()`:** Finds the greatest key less than or equal to (floor) and the smallest key greater than or equal to (ceiling) a given key, respectively. Useful for finding closest matches.
5. **`higherKey()` and `lowerKey()`:**  Finds the smallest key strictly greater than (higher) and greatest key strictly less than (lower) a given key. Similar to `floorKey()` and `ceilingKey()` but doesn't include the given key itself in the search.


The example includes clear output to illustrate the results of each search operation.  The use of a simple `Integer`-`String` TreeMap makes it easy to understand the concepts. Remember that TreeMaps store keys in sorted order, which enables efficient search operations.
