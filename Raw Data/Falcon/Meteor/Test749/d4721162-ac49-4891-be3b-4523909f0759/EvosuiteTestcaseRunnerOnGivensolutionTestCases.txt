JUnit version 4.13
..Original Map: {10=Alice, 25=Bob, 50=Charlie, 75=David, 100=Eve}
Submap with keys greater than 25: {50=Charlie, 75=David, 100=Eve}
Submap with keys greater than or equal to 25: {25=Bob, 50=Charlie, 75=David, 100=Eve}
Submap between 25 (inclusive) and 75 (exclusive): {25=Bob, 50=Charlie}

Important Considerations:
Original map after modification through submap: {10=Alice, 25=Bob, 50=Charlie, 75=David, 80=Frank, 100=Eve}
Submap with keys less than 50: {10=Alice, 25=Bob}
