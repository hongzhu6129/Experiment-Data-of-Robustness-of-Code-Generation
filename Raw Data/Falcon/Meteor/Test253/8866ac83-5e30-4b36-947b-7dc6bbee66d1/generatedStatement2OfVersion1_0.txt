Key improvements in this code:

* **Handles Jagged Arrays:**  The code now correctly processes 2D boolean arrays even if they are jagged (rows have different lengths). This is done by using `arr[i].length` in the inner loop.
* **Clearer Output:**  The output is formatted with spaces between the 't' and 'f' values and a newline after each row, making it much more readable.
* **Example with Jagged Array:** An additional example demonstrating how the code handles jagged arrays is included.
* **Helper Method:**  The printing logic is now encapsulated in a separate `print2DBooleanArray` method, which promotes code reusability and makes the `main` method cleaner.  This also makes it very easy to adapt the printing logic if needed in the future without modifying the `main` method.



This revised code addresses the issues in the previous response and provides a more robust and well-structured solution.
