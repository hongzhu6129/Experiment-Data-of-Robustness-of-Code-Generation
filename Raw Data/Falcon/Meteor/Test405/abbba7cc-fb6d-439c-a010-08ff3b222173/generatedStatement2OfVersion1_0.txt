Key improvements:

* **Generics:** The `swapElements` method now uses generics `<T>`, making it work with ArrayLists of any type, not just integers.
* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. This prevents the program from crashing if invalid indices are provided.
* **Clearer output:**  The output messages are more informative, indicating the original and swapped ArrayLists.
* **Demonstration of `Collections.swap`:** Shows how to use the built-in `Collections.swap` method as a more concise alternative.
* **Example with potential `IndexOutOfBoundsException`:**  Includes an example to explicitly show how the `try-catch` block handles errors, contrasting it with a version without error handling.  This is valuable for learning and understanding.



This revised code is more robust, flexible, and provides better error handling, making it a more complete solution.
