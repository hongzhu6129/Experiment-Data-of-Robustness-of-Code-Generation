Key improvements:

* **Handles Empty Arrays:** The code now explicitly handles the case where one or both arrays are empty. Empty arrays don't have first or last elements, so the comparison should return `false` in these scenarios.
* **Clearer Output:**  The `println` statements are more descriptive, making the output easier to understand.
* **Helper Function:** The comparison logic is encapsulated within a separate `compareFirstAndLast` method. This improves code organization and readability.  It also makes `main` more concise, focusing on setting up the test cases and printing the results.


This improved version is robust, handles edge cases, and is more readable and maintainable.
