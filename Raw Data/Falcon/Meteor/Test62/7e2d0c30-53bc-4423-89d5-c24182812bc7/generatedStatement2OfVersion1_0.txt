Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles `null` and empty arrays, preventing `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
* **Clearer Logic:** The comparison logic is more concise and easier to understand.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method includes more test cases to demonstrate the code's behavior with different inputs, including edge cases.
* **Helper Method:** The comparison logic is encapsulated in a separate `compareFirstLast` method, improving code organization and reusability.  This also adheres to the prompt's request to keep only the `main` method's signature visible.


This revised code addresses the potential issues of the previous version and provides a more robust and reliable solution for comparing the first and last elements of two integer arrays.
