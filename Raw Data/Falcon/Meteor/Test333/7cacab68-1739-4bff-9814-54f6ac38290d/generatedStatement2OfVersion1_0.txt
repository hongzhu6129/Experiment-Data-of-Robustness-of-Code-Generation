Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases**: The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` input, preventing potential `NullPointerExceptions`.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `uniqueIndex` replaces `index` for better readability, clearly indicating its purpose.

3. **Concise Return:** The `if (nums.length == 0) return 0;` condition streamlines the code.

4. **Comprehensive `main` method**: Includes more test cases demonstrating the handling of empty, null, and single-element arrays, along with the original example.  It also uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to only print the relevant portion of the modified array after duplicate removal. This is crucial because the original array is modified in place, but elements beyond the new length are not guaranteed to be meaningful.  Also added output for the null array example, demonstrating correct length handling.

5. **Javadoc Comments:**  Added clear Javadoc documentation to `removeDuplicates` to explain its purpose, parameters, and return value, improving code understanding.
