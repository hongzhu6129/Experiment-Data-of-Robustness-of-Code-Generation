Remember to add the JUnit library to your project.  Automated testing makes it easier to run your tests repeatedly and ensures that code changes don't introduce bugs.


By using `long` instead of `int`, the program can handle larger numbers and avoid integer overflow in most practical scenarios.  However, `long` also has its limits. If you need truly arbitrary precision, use `BigInteger`.
