Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Different Data Types:** The `Comparator` now correctly compares `String`s with `String`s, `Number`s with `Number`s, and handles cases where you're comparing a `String` to a `Number`.  This avoids `ClassCastException` errors.

2. **Number Comparison:** Uses `Double.compare` for comparing numbers. This handles different numeric types (e.g., `Integer`, `Double`, `Float`) correctly.

3. **Clearer Logic:**  The `compare` method's logic is more organized and easier to understand.

4. **Example with Complex Objects:**  The code now includes an example of how to sort a list of more complex objects (`SophisticatedObject`) using a custom comparator with multiple sorting criteria (first by name, then by value).

5. **Error Handling (Optional):** You could add more robust error handling, such as throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` in the `compare` method if you encounter an unexpected data type that you don't know how to compare.


How to compile and run:

1. Save the code as `SortSophisticatedList.java`.
2. Compile: `javac SortSophisticatedList.java`
3. Run: `java SortSophisticatedList`
