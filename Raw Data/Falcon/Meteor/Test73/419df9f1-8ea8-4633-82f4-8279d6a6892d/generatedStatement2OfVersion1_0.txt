Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Distinct Pairs:** The code ensures that the pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct by starting the inner loops from `a + 1` and `c + 1` respectively. This prevents solutions like `1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3` being reported as a solution.  It also avoids duplicate pairs like  `12^3 + 1^3` and `1^3 + 12^3`.

2. **Optimizations:** Several `break` statements are added to the loops to exit early when it's clear that no solution can be found. This significantly improves performance, especially for larger values of `n`.  We check if `a^3`, `b^3`, the `sum`, `c^3`, and `d^3` exceed `n` or the current `sum` to stop unnecessary calculations.

3. **Clarity:** The variable names (a, b, c, d, sum) make the code easier to read and understand the logic.

4. **Correctness:** The code now correctly identifies 1729 as the first taxicab number and prints the expected output:
