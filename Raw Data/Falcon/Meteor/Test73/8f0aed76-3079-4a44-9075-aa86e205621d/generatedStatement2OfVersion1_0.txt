Key improvements:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is structured more logically, making it easier to follow.  Variables are named more descriptively.
* **Efficiency:**  Several optimizations are added:
    * Breaking out of loops early when further calculations are unnecessary (e.g., when `a3`, `sum`, `c3`, or `d3` exceed `n`).
    * Ensuring `b < a`, `d < c` to avoid duplicate pairs and unnecessary calculations.
* **Correctness:** The code is corrected to ensure it finds numbers expressible as the sum of two cubes in *two or more* distinct ways, not just in any two ways.  The logic for counting and printing combinations is also corrected.
* **Explanation/Comments:** Comments are included to explain the purpose of code sections.





This improved version will efficiently find Ramanujan numbers up to the specified limit `n`.
