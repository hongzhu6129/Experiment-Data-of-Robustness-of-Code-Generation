Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:** The code now explicitly checks for null or short strings to avoid `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
* **Clearer logic:** The loop and conditional statements are more straightforward, making the code easier to understand.  The logic only checks if the *specified character* is surrounded by the same characters.
* **More comprehensive testing:** The `main` method includes more test cases to demonstrate different scenarios, including edge cases and successful matches.
* **More flexible:** You can easily change the `specifiedChar` variable to test with different characters without modifying the core logic.
* **Explanatory comments:** Added more comments to clarify the purpose and behavior of the code.
