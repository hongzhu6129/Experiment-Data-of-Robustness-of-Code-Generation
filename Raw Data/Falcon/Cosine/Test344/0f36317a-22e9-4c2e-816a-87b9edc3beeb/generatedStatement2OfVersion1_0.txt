**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **LinkedList:** We use `LinkedList` as specified in the problem.
2. **ListIterator:** The most efficient way to traverse a `LinkedList` and get both element and index is using a `ListIterator`. The `nextIndex()` method gives the index of the next element to be retrieved, and `next()` retrieves the element.
3. **For Loop with `get()`:**  While a regular `for` loop with `get()` works, it's less efficient for `LinkedList` because `get(i)` has to traverse from the beginning of the list each time.  It's included for completeness but ListIterator is generally preferred.
4. **Enhanced For Loop with Counter:** This approach is simple but requires manually maintaining the index, making it slightly less clean than the `ListIterator` method.
5. **Clear Output:** The code now includes clear labels for each method and newline characters (`\n`) to separate the outputs, making the results easier to read.
6. **Comments:** Comments have been added to explain the different approaches.





This improved version provides multiple ways to achieve the desired output and highlights the most efficient approach for `LinkedList`.  It's also more readable and understandable.
