Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Clarity and Comments:**  Clearer explanations of what each section of the code does.
* **Multiple Iteration Methods:** Shows three different ways to access/print the elements: 
    1. Enhanced `for` loop (recommended - doesn't modify the queue).
    2. `poll()` method (demonstrates how to retrieve and remove the head, but empties the queue).
    3. `toString()` method (less readable, but useful for quick checks).
* **Copy for Destructive Method:** Creates a copy of the original queue before using `poll()` so that the original queue isn't modified when demonstrating the `poll()` method.
* **Output Formatting:** Added separators to make the output easier to understand.


This example provides a more complete and pedagogical way to learn about using `PriorityQueue` in Java.  It emphasizes best practices and shows the consequences of different approaches.
