Key improvements in this version:

- **Clearer Example in `main`:** The `main` method now demonstrates how to create a sample tree and clone it. It also prints both the original and cloned trees using the `traverseTree` method, making it easier to verify the functionality.
- **Iterative `traverseTree`:**  The traversal method now uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) with a queue for level order traversal. This is more efficient than recursive approaches, especially for large, skewed trees.
- **Informative Output:** The `traverseTree` method prints the node values to the console, making it clear which tree is being traversed.
- **Robustness:**  Handles the case of an empty input tree (where `root` is null).



This improved version provides a complete and working example that demonstrates how to clone a binary tree using the specified method signatures, while addressing the efficiency and clarity issues of the previous attempt.
