**Explanation:**

1. **`public static int convert(int num)`:** This method takes an integer `num` as input.
2. **`if (num < 0)`:** It checks if the number is negative.
3. **`return -num;`:** If the number is negative, it returns the negation of the number (making it positive).
4. **`else { return num; }`:** If the number is positive or zero, it simply returns the number itself.


**`main` method demonstration:**

The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `convert` method with different example inputs (positive, negative, and zero) and prints the results to the console. This helps illustrate the functionality of the `convert` method in a clear and concise way.  It's good practice to demonstrate your code's usage with examples.
