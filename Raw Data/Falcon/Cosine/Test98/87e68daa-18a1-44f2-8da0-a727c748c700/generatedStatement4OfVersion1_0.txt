2. **Unicode Character Test:**  This might seem trivial, but ensure your console/terminal supports Unicode characters.  If it doesn't, the face might not display correctly.  Try running the program on different systems or terminals with varying character set support.

3. **Whitespace Test:**  Verify the exact whitespace.  A single extra space or a missing space can change the face's appearance.  Again, comparing the output file to an expected output file is the best way to do this.

4. **System.out Test (Advanced):**  While more complex than needed for this example, for more involved programs, you could explore testing `System.out` directly by using `ByteArrayOutputStream` to capture the output stream and then checking the contents of the byte array.  This is useful when you're testing methods that write to the console and you want to avoid relying on visual inspection or file I/O.
