     Then, you could use a diff tool or write a simple Java program to compare `output.txt` with a file containing the expected face string. This approach is useful if you were to modify the `printFace()` function later.

4. **Boundary Conditions (Conceptual � thinking about extensibility):**

   * **Size/Scaling (Hypothetical):** If we were to extend the program to allow for different face sizes, we'd test with very small and very large sizes to ensure the face scales correctly. This would require changes to the program, of course.  This is more of a future-proofing consideration.

   * **Character Replacement (Hypothetical):**  If the program allowed customizing the characters used (e.g., using different symbols for the eyes or mouth),  test with various valid and invalid characters (e.g., very long Unicode characters or control characters) to see how the face renders. Again, this would require modifying the program first.
