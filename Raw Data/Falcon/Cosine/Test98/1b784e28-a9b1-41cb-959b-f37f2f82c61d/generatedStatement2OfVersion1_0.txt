**Test Cases (While you can't directly unit test output to console like this, these demonstrate different usage scenarios and potential corner/edge cases you'd consider if you were building a more complex system that generated such output):**

1. **Basic Test:**  Simply call the `printFace()` method.  This verifies the basic functionality.

2. **Redirection (Not a Java test, but a shell concept):** Run the program and redirect the output to a file. This allows you to examine the output programmatically if you need to in a more advanced scenario.  e.g., `java PrintFace > output.txt`. Then you could compare `output.txt` with an expected output file.

3. **Character Encoding (More relevant for file output):** If you were writing this face to a file, you might want to test with different character encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.) to ensure the special characters display correctly.  This becomes especially relevant for internationalization where you might be using a broader range of characters.

4. **Integration (Hypothetical):** Imagine you were using `printFace()` as part of a larger system. For example, a game that prints different faces based on character emotions. You would test the integration of `printFace()` within that larger system.  Perhaps by mocking the output stream and verifying that `printFace()` was called with the correct parameters (if it were modified to take parameters like emotion).

5. **Modification for Different Faces (Example of extending the code):**
