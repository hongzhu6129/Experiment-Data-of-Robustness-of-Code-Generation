**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input Number | Expected Output | Justification/Corner Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | 0 is even. | Zero is an even number (divisible by 2 with no remainder). |
| 2 | 1 | 1 is not even (odd). | Basic odd number test. |
| 3 | 2 | 2 is even. | Basic even number test. |
| 4 | -2 | -2 is even. | Negative even number.  |
| 5 | -1 | -1 is not even (odd). | Negative odd number. |
| 6 | 1000 | 1000 is even. | Large positive even number. |
| 7 | -1000 | -1000 is even. | Large negative even number. |
| 8 | Integer.MAX_VALUE | Integer.MAX_VALUE is not even (odd). | Largest possible Java integer (odd). |
| 9 | Integer.MIN_VALUE | Integer.MIN_VALUE is even. | Smallest possible Java integer (even). Be careful with overflow in other languages if doing similar tests!|




**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You can manually input these test cases into the program's console prompt.  For more automated testing, you would use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a basic example of how you might structure a JUnit test:
