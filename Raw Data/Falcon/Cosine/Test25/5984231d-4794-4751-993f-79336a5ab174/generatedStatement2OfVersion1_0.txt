This code prints the key Java environment details. It also includes a basic check (which you can customize) to see if a particular Java version (like 1.8.0) is present by examining the `java.version` property.  This is a very basic way to check for installation, but it can be extended if needed. You'd typically do this type of check using installation tools or scripts.
