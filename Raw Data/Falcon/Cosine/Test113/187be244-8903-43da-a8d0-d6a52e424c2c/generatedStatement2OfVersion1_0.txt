Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:** Includes explicit checks for null and empty input arrays.
- **Clearer variable names:**  `uniqueIndex` makes the purpose more obvious.
- **Concise logic:** The core logic for removing duplicates remains efficient.
- **Thorough testing in `main`:**  Demonstrates usage with different scenarios, including empty, null, and arrays without duplicates, ensuring robustness.
- **Prints only the modified portion:** Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` in the `main` method to print only the part of the array containing the unique elements, avoiding confusion about the unchanged (and possibly duplicate) latter part of the array.


This revised code adheres to the specified method signatures and effectively addresses the problem while also being more robust and easier to understand.
