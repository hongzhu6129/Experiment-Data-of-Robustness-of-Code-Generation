Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  It correctly handles empty and null arrays.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive.
- **Concise logic:** The code is streamlined for readability.
- **Comprehensive testing in `main`:** Includes examples with different input scenarios, including edge cases (empty and null array) and an array with no duplicates, to demonstrate the correctness of the `removeDuplicates` function. 
- **Prints the updated array:** The `main` method now uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant part of the modified array (up to the new length) avoiding displaying the unchanged, "garbage" values after the unique elements. This makes the output clearer and easier to understand.


This revised response addresses the problem more effectively and is more robust. It's also easier to understand and maintain.
