Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`java.time` API:**  Uses the modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8) for date/time handling. This is significantly better than the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes.

2. **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle `DateTimeParseException`.  This is crucial.  If the user enters dates in the wrong format, the program will gracefully inform them instead of crashing.

3. **Clear Prompts:** The `System.out.println()` statements provide clear instructions to the user about the expected date format.

4. **`Period` for Difference:** Uses the `Period` class to calculate the difference between the dates, directly giving you years and months.

5. **Scanner Closed:** Closes the `Scanner` at the end to release resources.

6. **Example Usage and Output:** Included below to illustrate how to interact with the program.
