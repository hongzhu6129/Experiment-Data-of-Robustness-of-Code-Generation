**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You can easily test these cases by running the Java program and providing the respective inputs. For the invalid input cases, observe that the program correctly handles the error and prompts the user again for valid integer input.  The large integer test case will help confirm that your code can handle larger numbers and doesn't overflow.  The zero and negative cases cover important boundaries.


This improved answer provides more comprehensive test cases, including corner cases for invalid input and demonstrates how to use a `Scanner` for robust input handling.  The use of a separate `printScalarTable` method improves code organization.
