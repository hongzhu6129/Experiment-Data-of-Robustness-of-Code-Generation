Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Node Class:** The `Node` class is explicitly defined to represent the structure of a binary tree node.  This improves readability and organization.

2. **Recursive `maxDepth` Method:** This method implements the core logic for calculating the maximum depth using recursion.  The base case is when `node` is `null` (empty subtree), returning 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the depth of the left and right subtrees and returns the maximum of the two, plus 1 (for the current node).

3. **Comprehensive `main` Method:**  The `main` method now includes several test cases:
   - A sample tree with multiple levels.
   - An empty tree (to demonstrate the base case handling).
   - A tree with just a single node.  This ensures the method handles simple cases correctly.

4. **Clear Output:** The `println` statements clearly label the output, making it easy to understand the results of each test case.


This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and demonstrates good coding practices.
