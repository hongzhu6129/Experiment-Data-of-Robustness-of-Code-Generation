Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays and single-element arrays.
* **Clearer variable names:** `k` is a more descriptive variable name than `index`.
* **Improved comments:** The comments explain the logic and purpose of the code more effectively.
* **Main method for demonstration:** The `main` method provides examples of how to use the `removeDuplicates` method and showcases its functionality with different inputs including edge cases.
* **Prints only the relevant portion of the array:**  The code utilizes `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the modified part of the array (up to the new length), avoiding printing the trailing "garbage" values.


This revised version is more robust, readable, and demonstrably correct.
