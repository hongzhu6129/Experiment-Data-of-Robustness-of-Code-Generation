**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **`TreeMap` with `Comparator`:** The code uses a `TreeMap` which automatically sorts its keys.  The crucial part is providing a custom `Comparator` during the `TreeMap`'s construction.  This tells the `TreeMap` *how* to sort the keys.

2. **`KeyComparator` Class:**  A separate nested class `KeyComparator` implements the `Comparator<String>` interface.  This is where the sorting logic resides.

3. **`compare(String s1, String s2)` Method:** This method within the `KeyComparator` is the heart of the sorting. It receives two strings (`s1` and `s2`) and returns:
   - a negative integer if `s1` should come before `s2`,
   - a positive integer if `s1` should come after `s2`,
   - zero if `s1` and `s2` are considered equal for sorting purposes.

4. **Case-Insensitive Sorting:** The provided `compare` method uses `s1.compareToIgnoreCase(s2)` to achieve case-insensitive sorting.

5. **Clear Example in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to create the `TreeMap` with the custom comparator, add elements, and print the sorted map. The optional demonstration shows how to explicitly use the comparator.

6. **Flexibility:** You can easily modify the `compare` method to implement different sorting logics (e.g., reverse order, sorting by length, etc.) without changing the rest of the code.



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. Save the code as `SortTreeMapKeys.java`.
2. Compile: `javac SortTreeMapKeys.java`
3. Run: `java SortTreeMapKeys`
