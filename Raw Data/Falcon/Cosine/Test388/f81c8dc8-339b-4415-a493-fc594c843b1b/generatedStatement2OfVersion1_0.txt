Key improvements:

* **Handles edge cases:** The code explicitly handles empty and null input arrays, preventing potential `NullPointerExceptions`.
* **Clearer variable names:** Using `k` instead of `index` improves readability by aligning with common problem descriptions.
* **Concise comments:**  Comments are focused on explaining the logic rather than simply restating the code.
* **Example usage in `main`:** Demonstrates how to use the function and interpret the results, including printing only the relevant part of the modified array and handling  null input.
* **Efficiency:** The algorithm operates in-place (O(1) space complexity) and linear time (O(n) time complexity), as required.
