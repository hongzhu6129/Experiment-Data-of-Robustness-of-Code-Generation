Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Clear Javadoc:** The `removeDuplicates` method now has a comprehensive Javadoc comment explaining its purpose, parameters, return value, and providing examples.  This is crucial for educational code.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code explicitly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays, demonstrating robust programming practice and preventing `NullPointerExceptions`.

3. **Concise Logic:** The core logic for removing duplicates is efficient and easy to follow. It uses a single `uniqueIndex` to keep track of where to place the unique elements.

4. **Informative Output:** The `main` method demonstrates the usage of `removeDuplicates` with different inputs, including edge cases. It prints both the updated length and the relevant portion of the modified array using `Arrays.copyOfRange` for clarity. (The elements after `len` are not relevant, as indicated by the problem description using underscores.)

5. **In-Place Modification:**  The solution correctly modifies the original array as specified in the problem description.

6. **Handles Already Unique Arrays:** The provided code correctly handles the scenario where the input array already contains unique elements.


This revised example adheres to the specified method signatures and provides a much more effective educational demonstration.
