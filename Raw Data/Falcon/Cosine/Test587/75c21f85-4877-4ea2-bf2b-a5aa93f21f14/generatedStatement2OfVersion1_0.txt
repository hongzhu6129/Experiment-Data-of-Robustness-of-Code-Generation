Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles Negative Numbers:**  The code now correctly handles negative input numbers by taking the absolute value before calculating the sum of digits and adding "negative" before printing the English words.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `originalNum` to store the input helps clarity.
* **Concise Digit Printing:**  The `printDigitsInEnglish` function is more streamlined and efficient.
* **Error Handling (in `print_number`):** The `print_number` method now includes a check to ensure that the input digit is within the valid range (0-9).  This prevents potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` errors.
* **Space Between Words:** Added a space between the English words when printing multiple digits.
* **Newline at the end:** A newline character is printed at the end to ensure the output is formatted correctly.
