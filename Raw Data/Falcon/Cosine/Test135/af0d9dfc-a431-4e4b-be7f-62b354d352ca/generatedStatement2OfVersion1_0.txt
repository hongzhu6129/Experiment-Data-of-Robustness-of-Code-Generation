**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `m` and `n` for dimensions and `target` for the searched number makes the code easier to read.

2. **`result` Array:** The `Saddleback` function now returns an `int[]` to store both row and column index.  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`. This is a cleaner way to handle "not found" cases than printing directly within the search function.

3. **Early Return:** When the target is found, the function immediately returns the `result`. This avoids unnecessary iterations.

4. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic.

5. **Example Usage:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` function and handles the "not found" scenario gracefully.

6. **Conciseness:** The code is more compact and focused while maintaining readability.



**How the Saddleback Search Works:**

The algorithm starts at the top-right corner of the matrix.

- If the current element is equal to the target, we've found it.
- If the current element is smaller than the target, we know the target cannot be in that row (since rows are sorted ascending), so we move down to the next row.
- If the current element is larger than the target, we know the target cannot be in that column (since columns are sorted ascending), so we move left to the previous column.

This process continues until either the target is found or we go out of bounds of the matrix (meaning the target is not present).
