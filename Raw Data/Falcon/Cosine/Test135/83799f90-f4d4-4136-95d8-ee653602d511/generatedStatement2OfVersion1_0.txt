**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly follows the specified method signatures `main` and `Saddleback`.

2. **Saddleback Search Implementation:**  The `Saddleback` method efficiently searches the 2D array.  It starts from the top-right corner:
   - If the current element is equal to the target, the position is returned.
   - If the current element is smaller than the target, we move down to the next row (because elements increase as we move down).
   - If the current element is larger than the target, we move left to the previous column (because elements increase as we move right).


3. **Return an Array for Coordinates:** The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` of size 2, holding the row and column indices of the target element.  If the element is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.

4. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Saddleback` method with a sample array and target. It handles the case where the target is not found.

5. **Comments:**  The code includes comments to explain the logic.



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SaddlebackSearch.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using the Java compiler:
