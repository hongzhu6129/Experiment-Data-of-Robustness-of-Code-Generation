Key improvements in this code:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  Variable names (e.g., `piApproximation1`, `numTerms`, `subtract`) make the code's purpose more understandable.
* **Correct Denominator Calculation:** The logic to calculate the denominator (3, 5, 9, 11, 13...) is now accurate and concise.
* **Flexibility:** The `calculatePi` method now takes the number of terms as an argument, making it easy to test with different values.  
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the key parts of the logic.
* **Use of `1.0`:**  The code now uses `1.0` for calculations instead of `1` to ensure floating-point arithmetic.
