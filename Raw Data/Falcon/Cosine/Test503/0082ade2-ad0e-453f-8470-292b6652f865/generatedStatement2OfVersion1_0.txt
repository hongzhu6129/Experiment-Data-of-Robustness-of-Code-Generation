Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Comments:** Added comments throughout the code to explain each step.
2. **Empty List Handling:** Includes a check for an empty list using `isEmpty()` to prevent `NoSuchElementException` when using `peek()`, `poll()` or `element()` on an empty list. This makes the code more robust.
3. **`peekFirst()` Example:** Demonstrates `peekFirst()`, showing it is equivalent to `peek()`.
4. **`poll()` Comparison:** Shows the difference between `peek()` (retrieves only) and `poll()` (retrieves and removes).
5. **`element()` and Exception Handling:** Demonstrates `element()` (similar to `peek()`, but throws an exception if the list is empty). Includes a `try-catch` block to handle `NoSuchElementException`. This highlights an important difference between `peek()` and `element()`.
6. **Clearer Output:** Improved output messages make it easier to understand what's happening at each step.




This enhanced example provides a much more educational and robust demonstration of how to retrieve the first element of a `LinkedList` in Java.
