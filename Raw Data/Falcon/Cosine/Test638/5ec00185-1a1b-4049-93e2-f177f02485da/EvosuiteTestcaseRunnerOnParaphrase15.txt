Explanation:
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

Generally, symbols are placed from left to right with the highest value first. However, there are six instances where subtraction is used:
I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

The Algorithm:
1. Create a map to store the values of Roman numerals.
2. Initialize the result to 0.
3. Iterate through the Roman numeral string from right to left.
4. If the current value is less than the next value (e.g., IV), subtract the current value from the result.
5. Otherwise, add the current value to the result.
