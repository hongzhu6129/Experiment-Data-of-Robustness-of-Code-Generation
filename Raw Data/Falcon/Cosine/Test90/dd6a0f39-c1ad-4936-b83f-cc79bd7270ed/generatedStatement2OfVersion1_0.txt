**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Empty Array:**  The code now correctly handles the case of an empty input array by returning 0.

2. **In-Place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` method modifies the input array `nums` in place.  The unique elements are shifted to the beginning of the array.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** The variable `uniqueCount` is used to keep track of the number of unique elements, making the code more readable.

4. **Efficient Approach:**  This uses a single loop, providing an O(n) time complexity solution, which is the most efficient for this problem.

5. **Outputting the Updated Array:**  In `main`,  `Arrays.copyOfRange` is used to print only the relevant part of the modified array (the unique elements). This avoids printing the leftover duplicate values that are still present at the end of the original array after the in-place modification.


This revised code addresses potential issues and provides a robust and efficient solution for removing duplicates from a sorted array while adhering to the specified method signatures.
