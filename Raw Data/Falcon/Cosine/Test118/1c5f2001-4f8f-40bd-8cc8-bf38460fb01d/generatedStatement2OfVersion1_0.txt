Key improvements:

- **Handles edge cases:** The code now correctly handles empty and null input arrays.
- **Clearer variable names:** Using `k` for the new length makes the code easier to understand.
- **In-place modification:** The code modifies the original array as required by the problem statement.
- **Comprehensive main method:** The `main` method now includes more test cases demonstrating different scenarios, including empty and null arrays.
- **Output formatting:**  The `main` method uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` and `Arrays.toString` to print the updated array correctly, only displaying the relevant portion after removing duplicates.  It also handles the null case gracefully.
