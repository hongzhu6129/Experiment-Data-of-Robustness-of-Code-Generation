Key improvements in this version:

- **Clearer Comments:**  The code includes comments explaining the purpose of each section.
- **Partial Reverse Demonstration:** The code now shows how to iterate a part of the LinkedList in reverse order.  This addresses the "part reverse" aspect of the original prompt more directly.
- **Error Handling (for partial reverse):**  The `startIndex` calculation now uses `Math.max` to prevent an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if you try to reverse more elements than are in the list.
- **Conciseness:** The code is more streamlined and avoids unnecessary variable assignments.  The output is also a little cleaner.
