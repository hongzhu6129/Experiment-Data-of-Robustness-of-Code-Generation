By using a testing framework, you can automate the testing process and easily verify that your `findLargest` method works correctly for a variety of inputs, including corner cases.  This is standard practice in software development.


Key improvements and explanations in the code and tests:

* **`Math.max()`:** Using `Math.max()` is the most concise and efficient way to find the largest of two numbers.
* **`Scanner.close()`:** Closing the `Scanner` is important to release system resources.
* **JUnit Tests:**  Using a testing framework like JUnit makes testing more organized, repeatable, and automated.  It's highly recommended for any serious Java development.
* **Corner Cases:** The test cases now explicitly cover important corner cases, including equal numbers, maximum and minimum integer values, and zero.
* **Clearer Comments and Explanations:**  The code and test cases are better documented to enhance understanding.
