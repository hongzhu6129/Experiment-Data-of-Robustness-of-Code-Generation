This code does the following within the `main` method:

1. **Handles Invalid Input:** Checks if `n` (the number of coins) is positive.
2. **Calculates the Number of Rows:**  Determines how many complete rows of the staircase can be formed with the given `n` coins.
3. **Prints the Staircase:**  Uses nested loops:
   - The outer loop iterates through each row.
   - The inner loops print spaces and asterisks (*) to create the staircase shape.  The number of spaces decreases with each row, and the number of asterisks increases.
4. **Newline after each row:** `System.out.println();` moves the cursor to the next line after printing each row, creating the staircase structure.


**Example Output (for n=5):**
