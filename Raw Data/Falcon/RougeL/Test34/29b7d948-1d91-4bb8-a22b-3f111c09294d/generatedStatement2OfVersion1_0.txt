Key improvements in this code:

* **Handles both uppercase and lowercase hexadecimal digits:** The code now correctly converts both `A-F` and `a-f` to their decimal equivalents.
* **Error Handling (optional):**  The `hex_to_decimal` function returns `-1` if an invalid character is encountered in the hexadecimal string. The `main` method then checks for this and prints an error message.  You could also choose to throw an exception instead.
* **Clearer variable names:**  `power` is a more descriptive name than `n`.
* **Uses `Math.pow`:** Although a loop for powers of 16 could be used, `Math.pow` is more concise and readable for this specific task.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `input.close()` after it's no longer needed, which is good practice.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `HexToDecimal.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run `javac HexToDecimal.java`.
3. **Run:**  After successful compilation, run `java HexToDecimal`.  The program will prompt you to enter a hexadecimal number.
