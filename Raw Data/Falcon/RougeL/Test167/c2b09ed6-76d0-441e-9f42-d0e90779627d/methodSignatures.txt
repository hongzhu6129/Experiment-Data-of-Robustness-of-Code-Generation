 Only use the method signatures  static BigInteger rev(BigInteger),  static Tuple lychrel(BigInteger), public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the problem description: write a Java program to come the number of seed lychrel number candidates and related numbers for n in the range 1.. 10000 inclusive. (with a 500-iteration limit). a lychrel number is a natural number that cannot form a palindrome through the iterative process of repeatedly reversing its digits and adding the resulting numbers. this process is sometimes called the 196-algorithm, after the most famous number associated with the process. the first few lychrel numbers are 196, 295, 394, 493, 592, 689, 691, 788, 790, 879, 887,....
The programming language is Java.
