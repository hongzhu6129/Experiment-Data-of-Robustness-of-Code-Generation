**Test Cases:**

1. **Positive Integer:**
   - Input: 10
   - Expected Output: 1010

2. **Zero:**
   - Input: 0
   - Expected Output: 0  (This is a corner case)

3. **Negative Integer:**
   - Input: -5
   - Expected Output:  While the code handles this by simply converting the magnitude,  it's important to clarify  how negative numbers should be handled. Do you want two's complement representation?  If so, you'll need to modify the `functionone` method.  The current code will output 101 which is the binary representation of 5.

4. **Large Positive Integer:**
   - Input: 12345
   - Expected Output: 11000000111001

5. **Integer.MAX_VALUE:**
   - Input: 2147483647
   - Expected Output: 1111111111111111111111111111111 (This tests the upper limit)

6. **Integer.MIN_VALUE:**
   - Input: -2147483648
   - Expected Output:  Again, clarify the desired behavior for negative numbers.  The current code will generate the binary representation of the positive magnitude.  For two's complement, you'll need a different approach.  This tests the lower limit, and two's complement handling of this specific value is a key corner case.


**Modified `functionone` for Two's Complement (if needed):**
