Key improvements:

* **Clearer Error Handling:**  Uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `DateTimeParseException` if the input string is not in the expected format. This makes the code more robust.
* **ISO 8601 Format:**  Uses the `ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME` formatter for a standardized, widely-compatible string representation.
* **Custom Formatting Demonstrated:** Shows how to format both from string to `LocalDateTime` and from `LocalDateTime` to string using custom patterns.
* **More Comprehensive Example:** Provides examples of different formatting patterns and clearly separates the string-to-date/time and date/time-to-string conversions.
* **Current Time Example:** Includes an example of getting the current date and time using `LocalDateTime.now()`.


This revised answer addresses the original request while providing more practical and robust code.  It also demonstrates the flexibility of Java's `DateTimeFormatter` for handling different date and time formats.
