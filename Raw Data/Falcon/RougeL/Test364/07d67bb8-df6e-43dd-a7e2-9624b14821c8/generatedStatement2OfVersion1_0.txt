Key improvements:

* **Uses `java.time`:** This is the modern Java date/time API and is significantly better than older options like `Date` and `Calendar`.
* **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles potential `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters an invalid date format. This makes the code more robust.
* **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted more clearly, indicating the difference in years, months, and days separately.
* **Input Validation:** While not exhaustive, prompting the user for input and specifying the required format enhances usability.
