**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Uses `Charset.availableCharsets()`:**  This method directly provides a `SortedMap` of available charsets, making the code much simpler and more efficient.

2. **Clearer Output:**  The output now includes both the canonical name (e.g., "UTF-8") and the display name (e.g., "UTF-8") of each charset. This makes it easier to understand the results.

3. **Optional Alias Printing:**  The code includes a commented-out line that would print the aliases for each character set. Uncomment if you need that information.

4. **Test Cases:** The `main` method now demonstrates several test cases, including:
   - Valid charset names (common and less common).
   - Corner cases: Invalid charset name, empty string, and `null`.
   - The `testGetCharset` helper function handles the `Charset.forName()` call and potential `IllegalArgumentException` gracefully.

**How to Run and Test:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ListAvailableCharsets.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and compile the code:
