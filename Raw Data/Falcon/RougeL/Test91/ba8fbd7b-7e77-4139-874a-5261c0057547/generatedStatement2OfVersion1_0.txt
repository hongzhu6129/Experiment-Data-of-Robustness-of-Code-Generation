**Test Cases and Corner Cases:**

Testing this kind of program is more about verification than finding bugs in the code itself (unless you suspect a problem with the underlying Java library).  You're primarily checking if the program accurately reflects the available charsets on the system it's running on.

1. **Standard Output Check:**

   - Run the program and visually inspect the output.  Does it list charsets that you expect to be available on your system (e.g., UTF-8, UTF-16, US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1)?

2. **Comparison with System Information:**

   - On some operating systems (like Linux), you can get a list of available charsets from system commands.  Compare the program's output with this list.  For example, on Linux, you might use `locale -a`.

3. **Empty SortedMap (Hypothetical Corner Case):**

   - While practically unlikely, you could simulate an empty `Charset.availableCharsets()` return value for a more rigorous unit test (though this depends on your testing framework):
