This improved code does the following:

1. **Uses `java.time`:**  This modern Java date/time API is much preferred over the older `Date` and `Calendar` classes.
2. **Gets all available zones:** `ZoneId.getAvailableZoneIds()` provides a set of all valid time zone IDs.
3. **Consistent formatting:** The `DateTimeFormatter` ensures that the output is consistent and easy to read.
4. **Clearer output:** The output includes both the formatted date/time and the time zone ID.  It now prints the zone ID itself to distinguish more effectively between time zones with potentially similar offsets.
5. **Handles Daylight Saving Time:** `ZonedDateTime` automatically handles daylight saving time transitions.

This code is more robust, easier to read, and uses best practices for handling dates and times in Java.
