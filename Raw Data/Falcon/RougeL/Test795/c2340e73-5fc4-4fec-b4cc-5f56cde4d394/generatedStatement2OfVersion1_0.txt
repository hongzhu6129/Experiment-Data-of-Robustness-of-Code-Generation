Key improvements and explanations in this educational example:

1. **Clearer Examples:**  Shows examples with both non-empty and empty LinkedLists to demonstrate how `removeFirst()` (and `poll()`) behaves in different situations.

2. **`poll()` Method:** Introduces the `poll()` method as a safe alternative to `removeFirst()`. `poll()` returns `null` if the list is empty, avoiding exceptions.

3. **Exception Handling with `removeFirst()`:** Includes a `try-catch` block to demonstrate how to handle the `NoSuchElementException` that `removeFirst()` throws when called on an empty list.  This is crucial for robust code.

4. **Comments and Explanations:**  Added more comments to explain each step and the different methods.

5. **Output Clarity:** Improved the output messages to be more descriptive and educational.

6. **`isEmpty()` Check:**  Emphasizes using `isEmpty()` to check if the LinkedList is empty before attempting to remove elements, promoting good coding practices.


This revised version provides a more complete and educational demonstration of how to remove the first element of a LinkedList in Java. It covers various scenarios, best practices, and error handling.
