Explanation of the approaches:

1. **Basic `println`:** This is straightforward but requires manual spacing adjustments, making it less flexible.

2. **`printf` with Format String:** This offers more control over spacing and alignment.  The `%3s` means "string with a minimum width of 3 characters".  It's slightly more adaptable if the pattern changes.  I've made some adjustments in the second `printf` example to better match the requested output.

3. **`print` for precise control:** This third approach using `print` and `\n` gives the *most accurate* representation of the requested output, eliminating any trailing whitespace that `println` might add. This is often the best way if exact formatting is crucial.


Choose the method that best suits your needs in terms of simplicity, flexibility, and precise output control.  The third option (`print`) is arguably the cleanest and most accurate way to reproduce the requested pattern precisely.
