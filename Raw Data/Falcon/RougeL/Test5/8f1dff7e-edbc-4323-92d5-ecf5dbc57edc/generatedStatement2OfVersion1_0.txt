Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Node Class:** The `Node` class is now explicitly defined to represent the structure of a ternary tree node.  This is better practice than relying on an implicit definition.

2. **Recursive `maxDepth`:** The `maxDepth` method recursively calculates the depth of the ternary tree:
   - **Base Case:** If the node is `null` (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  It recursively calculates the depth of the left, mid, and right subtrees. The maximum of these depths + 1 (for the current node) is the depth of the current subtree.

3. **Illustrative `main` Method:** The `main` method now includes two example ternary trees to demonstrate how to use the `maxDepth` method and show different tree structures.  This makes the code easier to understand and test.

4. **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic and purpose of the code sections.


This revised version addresses the feedback and provides a more robust and understandable solution for finding the maximum depth of a ternary tree in Java.
