**Explanation of the calculations and integer division:**

* **Integer Division:** In Java, when you divide an integer by another integer, the result is also an integer.  Any fractional part is truncated (discarded).  This is important for understanding resultC.

* **Result C:**
    * `-3 * 5` is `-15`.
    * `-15 / 8` is `-1` (because `-1.875` gets truncated to `-1`).
    * `20 + -1` is `19`.



**Important Note:** The original question had a typo ('h' instead of '+'). I've corrected it to '+' to make a meaningful calculation. If 'h' represented something else (like a variable), the code would need to be adjusted accordingly.
