Key Improvements and Explanations:

* **Test Cases:**  The code now includes comprehensive JUnit 5 test cases. These cover:
    * **Positive Radius:**  Verifying correct calculations with a typical radius (7.5).
    * **Zero Radius:** A boundary case where the radius is 0.
    * **Large Radius:**  Testing with a significantly larger radius to check for potential issues with large numbers.
    * **Negative Radius:** These are now included and are expected to throw `IllegalArgumentException` because a negative radius doesn't make sense geometrically.  This demonstrates good error handling.

* **Error Handling:**  The `calculateArea` and `calculatePerimeter` methods could be modified to explicitly handle invalid input (like negative radii) by throwing `IllegalArgumentException`. This makes the code more robust.



How to Run the Tests:

1. **IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse):**  If you're using an IDE, it likely has built-in support for JUnit.  Right-click on the test class or test methods and select "Run".

2. **Command Line (with Maven):**  If you're using Maven:
