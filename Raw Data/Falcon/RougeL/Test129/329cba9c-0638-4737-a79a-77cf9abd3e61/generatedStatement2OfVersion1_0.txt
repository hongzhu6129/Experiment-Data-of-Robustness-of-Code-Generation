This program illustrates the concept of canonical strings in Java by demonstrating how string literals are automatically placed in the string pool (a memory area for storing unique string objects).  It shows how the `intern()` method can be used to retrieve the canonical representation of any string, ensuring that duplicate strings are avoided and memory is optimized.  The output of the program clearly shows the difference between string equality based on object references (`==`) and content (`equals()`), and how `intern()` affects object references.
