**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`isPerfectCube(int n)` function:**
   - This function now correctly handles negative numbers. The cube root of a negative number is also real.  We take the absolute value and perform the cube root check.
   - The more efficient `Math.cbrt()` method (Java 9+) has been added but commented out. You can use it if your Java version supports it.
   - A compatible method for older Java versions using `Math.pow()` and `Math.round()` is also included.

2. **Hardcoded Input:** For now, the input is hardcoded for simplicity.  For a more interactive program, use the `Scanner` class to get input from the user.

3. **Clear Output:** The output clearly states whether the number is a cube or not.
