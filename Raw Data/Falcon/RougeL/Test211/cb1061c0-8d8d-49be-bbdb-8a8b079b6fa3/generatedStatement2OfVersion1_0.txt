Key improvements in this educational version:

1. **Handles Empty Maps:** Includes a check to prevent errors if the map is empty.  This is crucial for robustness.
2. **Clearer Output:**  Prints the results in an easy-to-understand format.
3. **Example with String Keys:** Demonstrates that the approach works with different key types (as long as they are `Comparable`).
4. **Important Note on Comparable:**  Explains the crucial requirement that map keys must be `Comparable` to use `Collections.max()` and `Collections.min()`. This prevents confusion and potential runtime errors (`ClassCastException`).
5. **Comments:**  Added more comments to guide learners through the code.


This revised version provides a much more comprehensive and educational demonstration of how to get key-value pairs associated with the greatest and least keys in a Java Map.
