**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Regular positive numbers:**
   - Input: 10, 20, 30
   - Expected Output: 20.0

2. **Negative numbers:**
   - Input: -5, -10, -15
   - Expected Output: -10.0

3. **Mix of positive and negative numbers:**
   - Input: -5, 10, 25
   - Expected Output: 10.0

4. **Zero included:**
   - Input: 0, 10, 20
   - Expected Output: 10.0

5. **All zeros:**
   - Input: 0, 0, 0
   - Expected Output: 0.0


6. **Large numbers:**
   - Input: 1000000, 2000000, 3000000
   - Expected Output: 2000000.0

7. **Decimal numbers:**
   - Input: 2.5, 5.5, 7.5
   - Expected Output: 5.166666666666667

8. **Corner case: Very large numbers (close to maximum double value):**
   - Input: Double.MAX_VALUE, Double.MAX_VALUE / 2, Double.MAX_VALUE / 4
   - Expected Output: Infinity (or a very large number depending on how Java handles overflow)

9. **Corner case: Very small numbers (close to minimum double value):**
   - Input:  Double.MIN_VALUE, Double.MIN_VALUE * 2, Double.MIN_VALUE * 4 // Note: Results may be close to 0 due to the nature of very small numbers
   - Expected Output: A very small number close to 0



**How to Run Test Cases (Manually):**

You can run these test cases manually by compiling and running the Java code, then entering the input values as prompted.  Verify that the output matches the expected output for each case.

**Automated Testing (Recommended):**

For a more robust and automated approach, use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a basic JUnit example:
