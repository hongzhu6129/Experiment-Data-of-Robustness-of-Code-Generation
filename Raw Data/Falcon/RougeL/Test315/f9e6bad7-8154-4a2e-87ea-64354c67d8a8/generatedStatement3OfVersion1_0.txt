With JUnit, you can easily run all these tests automatically and ensure your `calculateSum` method works as expected.  This makes it much easier to catch regressions if you make changes to your code in the future.  To use JUnit, you will need to add the JUnit library to your project. Most IDEs have built-in support for JUnit.


Key improvements in this revised response:

* **Clearer explanation of test cases:** The rationale behind each test case is now provided.
* **JUnit example:** Automated testing using JUnit is now included, which is the standard practice in Java development.
* **Handling of Larger Numbers (Clarified):** While the current solution handles up to 9 perfectly, the explanation now clarifies that for inputs larger than 9, the requirement is not for a mathematical operation, but more about string concatenation, which is not something tested here.   If that string manipulation *was* what you intended,  the problem description and code would have to be adjusted to reflect that.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is now closed in the `main` method, which is good practice.
