**Test Cases:**

While there are no input parameters to vary for this specific `printFace()` function,  we can still consider testing in a broader context, particularly if this were part of a larger application. Here's how we could approach testing:

1. **Visual Inspection:** The simplest "test" is to run the code and visually verify the output matches the expected face. This confirms the basic functionality.


2. **Output Redirection & Comparison (for automated testing):**

   We can redirect the output to a file and then compare it against a known-good output file.  This allows for automated testing.
