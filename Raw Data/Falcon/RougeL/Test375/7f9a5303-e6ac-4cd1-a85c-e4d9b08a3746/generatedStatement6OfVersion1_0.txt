**Key improvements in this version:**

* **Input Validation:** The `main` method now checks for the correct number of command-line arguments and handles `NumberFormatException` if the input is not a valid integer.  It also checks that `n` is a positive number.
* **Clearer Output:** The `printMatrix` method uses a more readable format for displaying the matrix elements (e.g., [0,0] [0,1]...).  It also adds a newline after each row for proper matrix formatting.
* **Adherence to prompt:**  The code strictly adheres to the requested method signatures.



This revised code provides a more robust and user-friendly way to generate and display n-by-n matrices in Java.
