**Key Improvements:**

* **Input Validation:** The `main` method now includes error handling:
    * It checks if exactly one command-line argument (the matrix size `n`) is provided.
    * It uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the input is not a valid integer.
    * It checks if `n` is positive.
* **Clearer Output:** The `printMatrix` method now prints each matrix element in the format `[i,j]` for better readability.
* **Concise and Efficient:** The code is written in a straightforward and efficient way, avoiding unnecessary complexity.


**Example Output (for `n=3`):**
