This code demonstrates three interpretations of "adding" PriorityQueues:

1. **Merging pq2 into pq1:**  `pq1.addAll(pq2)` directly adds all elements of `pq2` into `pq1`, modifying `pq1`.
2. **Creating a new combined PriorityQueue:** This approach creates a new `PriorityQueue` and adds the elements from both original queues, leaving the originals unchanged.
3. **Calculating the sum of all elements:** If the intent was to add the *values* within the queues, this method iterates through both and calculates the sum.


This revised answer addresses the original prompt's limitations (using only `main`) and clarifies different ways to combine or add elements of PriorityQueues.
