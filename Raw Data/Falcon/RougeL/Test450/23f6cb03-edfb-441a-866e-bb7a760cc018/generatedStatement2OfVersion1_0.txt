Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Clearer Explanation of HashSet Behavior:** The code now explicitly explains that HashSets don't guarantee order, so "emblazoning to the end" means simply adding the element.
* **Duplicate Handling Demonstration:** Shows what happens when you try to add a duplicate element to a HashSet (it has no effect).
* **LinkedHashSet Example:** Provides an example using `LinkedHashSet` for cases where maintaining insertion order is essential.  This shows the proper way to ensure an element is at the end, even if it was already present earlier in the set.
* **Improved Comments:** More detailed comments explain the purpose of each step.
* **Conciseness:**  Removed unnecessary complexity.


This code comprehensively addresses the prompt while clarifying HashSet behavior and offering an alternative for order-sensitive scenarios.
