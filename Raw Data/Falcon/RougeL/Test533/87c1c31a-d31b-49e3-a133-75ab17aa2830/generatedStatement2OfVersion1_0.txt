**Test Cases:**

**Normal Cases:**

1. **Input:** 12   **Expected Output:** 6 (Factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12)
2. **Input:** 7    **Expected Output:** 2 (Factors: 1, 7)
3. **Input:** 25   **Expected Output:** 3 (Factors: 1, 5, 25)
4. **Input:** 100  **Expected Output:** 9 (Factors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100)


**Corner/Edge Cases:**

5. **Input:** 0    **Expected Output:** The number of factors for 0 is infinite.
6. **Input:** 1    **Expected Output:** 1 (Factor: 1)
7. **Input:** -5   **Expected Output:** 2 (Factors: 1, 5)  (Handles negatives correctly)
8. **Input:** -12  **Expected Output:** 6 (Factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12) (Handles negatives correctly)
9. **Input:**  A very large prime number (e.g., 1299709) **Expected Output:** 2 (Handles large primes � should only have 1 and itself as factors)

**Invalid Input Case:**

10. **Input:** abc (or any non-integer)   **Expected Output:** Invalid input. Please enter an integer.


**How to Run Test Cases:**

You can run these test cases by:

1. **Manual Input:**  Compile the Java code and run it. Enter each test input value when prompted.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  Use a testing framework like JUnit to create automated tests.  This is the best approach for regression testing and ensuring correctness over time.  You can provide the test cases as input to your test methods and assert that the output from your program matches the expected output.
