nullInput Sentence 1:  \nWrite a Java program to sort an array of positive integers using the BogoSort Sort Algorithm.\nIn computer science, Bogosort is a particularly ineffective sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm. The algorithm successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. It is not useful for sorting but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with other more realistic algorithms. Input Sentence 2: 11. write a Java program to sort an array of positive integers or the bogosort sort algorithm. in computer science, bogosort is a particularly ineffective sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm. the algorithm successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. it is not useful for sorting but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with other more realistic algorithms.Cosine Similarity: 0.9993Euclidean Distance: 0.2340
