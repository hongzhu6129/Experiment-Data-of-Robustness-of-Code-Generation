This JUnit example makes testing more systematic and allows you to automate the process.  Remember to add the `calculateProduct` helper method to your `ProductOfTwoNumbers` class to make the tests work.  You would run these tests in an IDE or build tool that supports JUnit.


By using `long` instead of `int`, we broaden the range of numbers the program can handle and reduce the risk of integer overflow in most practical cases. However, even with `long`, very large numbers can still cause overflow, as demonstrated in some of the test cases.  The JUnit tests are highly recommended to check these corner cases effectively.
