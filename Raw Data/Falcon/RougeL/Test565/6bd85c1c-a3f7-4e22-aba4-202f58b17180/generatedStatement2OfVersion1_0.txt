Key improvements and explanations of the test cases:

* **Clearer Test Cases:**  The test cases are now more organized and clearly labeled for better readability and understanding.
* **Assertions:** Uses assertions (`assert`) to verify the expected output against the actual output.  If an assertion fails, it will throw an `AssertionError` and stop the program.  This makes testing more robust.
* **Corner Cases:**  The test cases now cover important corner cases:
    * **Single-digit month and day:** Ensures proper padding with zeros.
    * **Start and end of a day:** Tests the formatting at the boundaries of a day.
    * **Leap year:**  Includes a test case for February 29th in a leap year.
* **Testable Function:** The `formatDateTime` function is now separate from the `main` method, making it easier to unit test.
* **Comprehensive Tests:** While it's impossible to test every possible date and time, these tests cover a good range of representative values and edge cases.



To enable assertions, you need to run your Java program with the `-ea` (enable assertions) flag:
