Key improvements in this code:

* **Clearer Null Handling:** The `removeString` method now explicitly checks for null inputs and returns the original string if either is null.  This makes the behavior more predictable and prevents `NullPointerExceptions`.
* **More Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method includes examples with different strings and also tests how the code handles null inputs for both the main string and the string to be removed.
* **Informative Output:** The `main` method prints both the original string and the result after removal, making it easy to see the effect of the `removeString` method.
* **Efficiency with `replace()`:**  The `replace()` method is generally the most efficient way to remove all occurrences of a substring in Java. It handles the string manipulation internally in an optimized manner.
