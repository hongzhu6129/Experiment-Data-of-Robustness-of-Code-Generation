Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles null or empty input strings.  Also handles leading/trailing spaces gracefully.
- **Clearer variable names:** Using more descriptive names like `reversedString` improves readability.
- **Efficiency:** Using `StringBuilder` for string manipulation is more efficient than repeated string concatenation.
- **Trimmed output:**  The final output is trimmed to remove any extra spaces at the end.
- **Comprehensive test cases:**  The `main` method includes a variety of test cases to demonstrate different scenarios.


This revised code directly addresses the prompt's requirements and provides a more robust and well-structured solution.
