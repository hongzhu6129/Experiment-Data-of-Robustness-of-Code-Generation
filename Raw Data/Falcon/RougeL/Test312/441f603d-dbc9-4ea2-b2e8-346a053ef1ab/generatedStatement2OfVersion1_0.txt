**Test Cases:**

**1. Normal Case:**

* Input: 10 20 30
* Expected Output: The average is: 20.00

**2. Decimal Numbers:**

* Input: 2.5 5.7 8.2
* Expected Output: The average is: 5.47

**3. Negative Numbers:**

* Input: -5 10 15
* Expected Output: The average is: 6.67

**4. Zero Values:**

* Input: 0 0 0
* Expected Output: The average is: 0.00

**5. Large Numbers:**

* Input: 1000000 2000000 3000000
* Expected Output: The average is: 2000000.00


**Corner Cases:**

**6. Input with Non-Numeric Values:**

* Input: a b c  (or 10 a 20)
* Expected Output: Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.

**7. Input with less than three values:**

* Input: 10 20 (Press Enter)
* The program will wait for the third input. It won't proceed until it receives three valid double values.

**8.  Input with extra values (more than three):**
* Input: 10 20 30 40
* The program will take the first three numbers as input and ignore the rest. So, it will calculate the average of 10, 20, and 30.

**9.  Input with very large or very small numbers close to the limits of double:**
* Input: 1.7976931348623157E+308 -1.7976931348623157E+308 0 (Maximum positive and negative double values).  This will likely result in an Infinity or NaN (Not a Number) output depending on how the addition handles overflow/underflow.
* Input:  Double.MIN_VALUE Double.MIN_VALUE Double.MIN_VALUE (The smallest positive double). This tests the handling of very small values.

**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. Save the code as `AverageCalculator.java`.
2. Compile: `javac AverageCalculator.java`
3. Run: `java AverageCalculator`


By testing with these various cases, you ensure your program behaves correctly under different conditions and is robust enough to handle unexpected inputs.
