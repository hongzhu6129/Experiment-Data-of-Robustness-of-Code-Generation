**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Uniqueness:** The code now uses a `HashSet` called `uniqueNumbers` to store the generated numbers.  HashSets automatically handle uniqueness, so even if the same number is generated multiple times, it will only be stored once in the set.

2. **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted to clearly display the unique numbers and their count.

3. **Test Cases:**  The `test()` function simplifies testing. It takes the input digits and the expected count as arguments. Test cases now cover:
   - The standard case (distinct digits).
   - The corner case where all input digits are the same.
   - An edge case where some input digits are repeated.
   - A case where fewer than four digits are provided.


4. **Conciseness and Readability**:  Minor improvements for readability.



**How to Run:**

1. Save the code as `UniqueThreeDigitNumbers.java`.
2. Compile: `javac UniqueThreeDigitNumbers.java`
3. Run: `java UniqueThreeDigitNumbers`


The output will show the unique three-digit numbers generated and their count, followed by the results of the test cases.
