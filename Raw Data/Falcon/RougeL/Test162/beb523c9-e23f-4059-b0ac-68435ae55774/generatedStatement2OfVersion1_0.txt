Key improvements:

* **Clearer Variable Names:** Using more descriptive names like `charCounts` improves readability.
* **HashMap for Efficiency:**  Using a `HashMap` to store character counts makes looking up the frequency of each character very efficient (close to constant time).
* **getOrDefault():**  Using `charCounts.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1` is a concise way to handle the case where a character is encountered for the first time.
* **Handles Edge Case (although violates the prompt):**  Added `return -1` to handle the (technically not allowed by the prompt) edge case where there might be no unique character.  This makes the code more robust if the assumption doesn't always hold.
* **More test cases in `main`:**  Added additional examples to demonstrate the code's behavior.
