**Explanation and Test Cases:**

1. **`printFacing(int size)` method:**
   - Takes an integer `size` as input, which determines the height (and indirectly the width) of the facing.
   - Handles invalid input (size <= 0) by printing an error message.
   - Uses nested loops:
     - The outer loop ( `i`) iterates from 0 to `size - 1` (for each row).
     - The first inner loop ( `j`) prints the leading spaces for each row (the number of spaces increases with each row).
     - The second inner loop ( `j`) prints the stars for each row (the number of stars decreases with each row).

2. **`main` method (Test Cases):**
   - **Size 1:** Tests the smallest valid input.
   - **Size 3 and 5:** Tests typical small facings.
   - **Size 0 and -2:** Corner cases: Tests how the function handles invalid input (zero and negative size).  The program is designed to gracefully handle these cases with an error message.
   - **Size 10:** Tests a larger facing to ensure the logic scales correctly.
