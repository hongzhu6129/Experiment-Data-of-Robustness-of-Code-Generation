**Explanation and Test Cases:**

The `printFacing` method takes an integer `size` as input, which determines the dimensions of the facing.  It handles several cases:

1. **Invalid Input:** If `size` is less than or equal to 0, it prints an error message.  This handles the corner cases of zero and negative sizes.

2. **Size 1:** If `size` is 1, it prints a single asterisk. This is another corner case.

3. **Size 2:** If `size` is 2, it prints a filled square of asterisks.  This is a special case where the inside is also filled.

4. **General Case (size > 2):**  It iterates through rows and columns, printing asterisks at the border and spaces in the interior.

**Test Cases Covered:**

* **Size 1:**  Tests the minimal valid input.
* **Size 2:** Tests the filled square case.
* **Size 3, 5, 10:** Test typical cases with different sizes.
* **Size 0:** Tests invalid input (zero).
* **Size -2:** Tests invalid input (negative).
