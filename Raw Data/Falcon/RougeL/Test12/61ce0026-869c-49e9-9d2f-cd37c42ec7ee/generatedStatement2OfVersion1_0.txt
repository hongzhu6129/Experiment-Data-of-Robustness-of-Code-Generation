While there aren't really "corner cases" for printing a static image like this,  we can consider testing aspects like:

1. **Correct Output:** Does the program print the face exactly as designed?  Visual inspection is the primary test here.  You could compare the output against a known-good "golden" output file.

2. **Standard Output:** Ensure the output goes to the standard output stream (System.out) as expected.  This can be important if the program is later integrated into a larger system where output redirection might be used.


Here's an example of how you could theoretically (though a bit overkill for this simple program) use a test framework like JUnit and output redirection to test the output against a file:
