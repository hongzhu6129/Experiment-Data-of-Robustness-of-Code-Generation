nullInput Sentence 1:  \nWrite a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the Insertion sort algorithm.\nInsertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than other algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
