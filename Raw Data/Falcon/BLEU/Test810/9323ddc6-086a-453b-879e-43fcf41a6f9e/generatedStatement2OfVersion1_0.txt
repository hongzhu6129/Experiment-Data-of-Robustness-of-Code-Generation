**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly uses `public static void main(String[])` and `public static boolean is_narc_dec_num(long)` as required.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:**  I've used more descriptive variable names like `numStr` and `n` to enhance readability.

3. **Correct Power Calculation:** The most crucial fix is in the `is_narc_dec_num` function. It now correctly calculates the sum of the *n*th powers of the digits.

4. **Efficiency:**  The code now starts checking numbers from 1 and continues until 15 Narcissistic numbers are found.  The previous version had an unnecessary nested loop that significantly reduced efficiency.

5. **Output Clarity:** The output now clearly labels the generated numbers as "First 15 Narcissistic Fraction Numbers."



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.java` file (e.g., `NarcissisticFractions.java`).
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler:
