Key improvements:

* **Input Validation:** The code now validates that the input strings are indeed binary (contain only '0' or '1').  This prevents unexpected errors.
* **BigInteger:** Using `BigInteger` allows the program to handle very large binary numbers accurately, avoiding potential overflow issues with primitive integer types.
* **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles potential `NumberFormatException` during the conversion process, providing more robust error management.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The test cases cover various scenarios, including normal multiplication, edge cases (empty strings, zero, one), and invalid input.  The inclusion of very large numbers tests the use of `BigInteger`.
* **Clear Output:** The output is formatted to clearly show the input, calculated output, expected output, and whether the test passed or failed.
* **Performance Note:** I've added a comment regarding extremely large numbers. While `BigInteger` handles them, it's important to be aware of potential performance implications if the input size is unbounded. You might consider adding input size limitations in a production environment.
