**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`move_zero(int[] arr)`:**
   - Uses a `count` variable to keep track of the index where the next non-zero element should be placed.
   - Iterates through the array. If a non-zero element is found, it's swapped with the element at the `count` index, and `count` is incremented. This effectively moves all non-zero elements to the left.

2. **`swap(int[] arr, int a, int b)`:**
   - Now includes a check: `if (a != b)`. This avoids unnecessary self-swapping and slightly improves efficiency.
   - It uses addition and subtraction to swap the elements in place, avoiding the need for a temporary variable, making it slightly more optimized.

3. **`main(String[] args)`:**
   - Includes the provided example and several additional test cases to demonstrate the code's correctness with different input scenarios (arrays with no zeros, all zeros, zeros at the beginning, middle, and end). This thorough testing helps ensure the code is robust.

4. **Clarity and Readability:**
   - Comments have been added to explain the logic and the purpose of variables.
   - The code is formatted consistently for improved readability.


This revised version provides a more efficient, robust, and well-documented solution to the problem.
