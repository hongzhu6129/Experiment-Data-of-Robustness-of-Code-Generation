This code provides a comprehensive example of how to format the current date and time in Java using `LocalDateTime` and `DateTimeFormatter`.  It shows several common formats, including date only, time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats, and a custom format that includes the day of the week and month name.  The comments explain each step clearly, making it suitable for educational purposes.  It also avoids unnecessary classes or methods, sticking to the `main` method as requested.
