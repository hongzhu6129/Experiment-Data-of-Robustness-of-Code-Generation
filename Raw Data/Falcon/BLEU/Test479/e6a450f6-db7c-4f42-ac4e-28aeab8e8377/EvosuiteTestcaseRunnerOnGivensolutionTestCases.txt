JUnit version 4.13
..HashSet: [Apple, Grape, Orange, Banana]
TreeSet (natural ordering): [Apple, Banana, Grape, Orange]
TreeSet of numbers (reverse order): [10, 5, 2, 1]
TreeSet after adding a duplicate: [Apple, Banana, Grape, Orange]

Important Considerations:
- TreeSets store elements in a sorted order (either natural or custom).
- TreeSets do not allow null elements (unless using a custom Comparator that handles nulls), while HashSets allow one null.
- TreeSets offer efficient retrieval of elements in sorted order (e.g., using methods like first(), last()).
- The conversion process involves creating a new TreeSet and populating it with the elements of the HashSet. It doesn't modify the original HashSet.
