Key improvements:

* **Handles invalid inputs:** Checks for null or empty arrays and non-positive k values.
* **Uses a Min-Heap:**  This is the most efficient approach for finding k largest elements.  A `PriorityQueue` in Java implements a min-heap by default.
* **Clearer output:** Prints the k largest elements in a comma-separated format with a descriptive message.
* **Handles duplicates correctly:**  The min-heap approach naturally handles duplicate entries.
* **Handles k larger than array length:** If k is larger than the array's length, it prints all elements in the array in descending order.  This covers a potential edge case.
* **Reverse sorts the output:** Presents the k largest elements in descending order, which is generally expected for this type of problem.
