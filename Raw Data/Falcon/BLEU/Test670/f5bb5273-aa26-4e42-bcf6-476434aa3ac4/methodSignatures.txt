 Only use the method signatures public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the Problem Description : \n(Approximate p) p can be computed using the following formula:\np = 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) + (1/9) - (1/11) .. )\nWrite a program that displays the result of 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) + (1/9) - (1/11))\nand 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) + (1/9) - (1/11) + (1/13)\nUse 1.0 instead of 1 in your\nprogram.\n\n The programming language you need to use is: Java.\n\n Avoid using Solution as the class name.
