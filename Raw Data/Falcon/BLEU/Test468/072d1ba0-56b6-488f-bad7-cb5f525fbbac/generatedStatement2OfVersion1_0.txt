Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles Odd-Length Strings for Digraphs:** The code now correctly handles strings with odd lengths by appending a space to them before creating digraphs. This ensures that all characters are paired.
* **Clearer Code for Digraph Generation:** The logic for creating digraphs is more structured and easier to follow. It uses a nested `Collectors.collectingAndThen` to create pairs from the character stream.
* **Concise Lowercase Conversion:** The lowercase conversion uses the more concise `String::toLowerCase` method reference.
* **Output Clarity:** The output clearly labels the digraphs and lowercase strings.
