Key improvements and explanations in this code:

1. **Clear Node Class:**  A separate `Node` class is defined to represent the nodes of the binary tree.  This is standard practice and makes the code more organized.

2. **Recursive `maxDepth()`:**  The `maxDepth()` function is implemented recursively, which is the most elegant and efficient way to solve this problem.  The base case is when `node` is null (empty subtree), in which case the depth is 0. Otherwise, it calculates the depths of the left and right subtrees and returns the larger of the two, plus 1 (for the current node).

3. **Example Usage in `main()`:** The `main()` method demonstrates how to create a sample binary tree and then call the `maxDepth()` function to get the height. Two examples are provided to illustrate different tree structures.

4. **Comments:**  The code is well-commented to explain the logic.

5. **Improved Formatting:** The code is formatted for better readability.




This revised code provides a more robust and understandable solution for calculating the maximum depth of a binary tree.
