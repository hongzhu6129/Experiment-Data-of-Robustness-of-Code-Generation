Key improvements in this educational version:

- **Clearer Explanations:** Added comments and print statements within `main` to explain the logic and handle overflow.
- **Overflow Handling:**  Uses `long` to store the reversed number temporarily to detect overflow.  If overflow occurs, it returns 0. This is crucial because reversing a large integer can easily result in a number exceeding the `int` range.
- **Negative Number Handling:** Correctly handles negative input.
- **Example Cases:** Demonstrates various cases in `main`, including positive, negative, and overflow situations.



This enhanced version makes the code more suitable for educational purposes while being robust.
