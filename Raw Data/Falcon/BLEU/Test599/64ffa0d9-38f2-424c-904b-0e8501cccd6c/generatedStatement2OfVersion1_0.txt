The original error "invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'sort'" likely arose because you were trying to convert the string "sort" into an integer.  This updated code avoids that issue by implementing a proper merge sort algorithm using the specified method signatures. It demonstrates how to correctly use `merge()` and `sort()` to sort an integer array.  The `main` method provides an example usage and prints the sorted array.
