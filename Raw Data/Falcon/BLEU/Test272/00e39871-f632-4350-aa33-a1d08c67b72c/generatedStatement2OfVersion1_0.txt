**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 3. Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2 | 0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | Division by zero | Remainder by zero |
| 6. Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000 | 2 | 0 |
| 7. Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13 | 8 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0 |
| 8. Integer and Decimal | 10 | 2.5 | 12.5 | 7.5 | 25 | 4 | 0 |
| 9.  Negative Decimal | -10.5 | 2.5 | -8 | -13 | -26.25 | -4.2 | 0 |
| 10. Very Small Decimals | 0.0001 | 0.0002 | 0.0003 | -0.0001 | 0.00000002 | 0.5 | 0|  
| 11. Integer division with remainder | 17 | 5 | 22 | 12 | 85 | 3.4 | 2 |
| 12. Negative division with remainder | -17 | 5 | -12 | -22 | -85 | -3.4 | -2 |
| 13. Negative divisor with remainder | 17 | -5 | 12 | 22 | -85 | -3.4 | 2 |


**Explanation of Corner Cases and their Handling:**

* **Division by Zero (Test Case 5):** The code explicitly checks for division by zero and prints an appropriate message instead of throwing an `ArithmeticException`.
* **Remainder by Zero (Test Case 5):**  Similar to division, the code handles remainder by zero with a message to prevent exceptions.
* **Very Small Decimals (Test case 10):**  Included to check how the program handles potential floating-point precision issues.
* **Remainders with different sign combinations (Test Cases 11, 12, 13):** The code uses the modulo operator `%`, which handles remainders differently with negative numbers compared to some other languages or mathematical definitions.  These test cases ensure you understand Java's specific remainder behavior.


By running these test cases, you can verify that the program correctly performs the arithmetic operations and handles potential issues like division by zero and floating-point precision.  It's good practice to have a comprehensive set of tests when writing any program.
