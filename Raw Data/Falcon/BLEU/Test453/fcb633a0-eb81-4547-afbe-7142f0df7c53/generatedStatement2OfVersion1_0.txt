**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases and corner cases you can use to verify the program:

1. **Standard Case (Given Example):**
   - Input: `radius = 7.5`
   - Expected Output:
     - Perimeter: approximately `47.12`
     - Area: approximately `176.71`

2. **Zero Radius:**
   - Input: `radius = 0`
   - Expected Output:
     - Perimeter: `0`
     - Area: `0`

3. **Negative Radius (Invalid Input - Should be handled):**
   - Input: `radius = -5`
   - Expected Behavior: The program should ideally handle this gracefully, either by throwing an exception or printing an error message indicating that the radius cannot be negative.  A simple modification to handle this could be:
