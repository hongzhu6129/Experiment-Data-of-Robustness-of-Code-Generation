..Initial HashSet: [banana, orange, apple]
HashSet after clear(): []
Repopulated HashSet: [red, green, blue]
HashSet after creating a new one: []

Explanation:
The `clear()` method is the most efficient and preferred way to empty a HashSet. It removes all elements from the existing HashSet.
Creating a new HashSet using `set = new HashSet<>();`  achieves the same outcome but is generally less efficient because it involves discarding the existing object and creating a new one in memory.  Use this approach sparingly, typically when you want to ensure no references to the old HashSet remain.
