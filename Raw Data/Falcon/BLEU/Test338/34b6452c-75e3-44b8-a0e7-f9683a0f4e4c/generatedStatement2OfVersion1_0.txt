**Test Cases:**

1. **Valid Input:**
   - Input: `sideLength = 5`
   - Expected Output: `The area of the hexagon is: 64.9519052838329`

2. **Zero Side Length:**
   - Input: `sideLength = 0`
   - Expected Output: `Error: Side length must be a positive value.`

3. **Negative Side Length:**
   - Input: `sideLength = -2`
   - Expected Output: `Error: Side length must be a positive value.`

4. **Very Large Side Length:**
   - Input: `sideLength = 100000`  (Tests for potential overflow issues, though doubles have a large range)
   - Expected Output: `The area of the hexagon is: 2.598076211353316E10`

5. **Small Side Length:**
   - Input: `sideLength = 0.001` (Tests handling of small values)
   - Expected Output: `The area of the hexagon is: 2.598076211353316E-6`


**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You can manually test these by running the program and entering the input values.  For more automated testing, you would typically use a testing framework like JUnit.  Here's a basic example of how you could structure a JUnit test (you'd need to add the JUnit library to your project):
