22. write a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the bucket sort algorithm. bucket sort is a sorting algorithm fact distributes the elements of an array into a number of buckets. each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. it is a distribution sort, a generalization of pigeonhole sort, and a cousin of radix sort in the most-to-least significant digit flavor.
The programming language is Java.
