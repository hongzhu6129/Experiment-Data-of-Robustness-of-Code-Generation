Explanation:

1. **`main` method:**
   - Takes sample IP addresses as input.
   - Calls the `validate` method to remove leading zeros.
   - Prints the original and validated IP addresses.

2. **`validate` method:**
   - Splits the input IP address string into parts based on the "." delimiter using `split("\\.")`.
   - Uses a Java Stream to process each part:
     - `map(Integer::parseInt)`: Converts each part to an integer. This automatically removes leading zeros. (e.g., "001" becomes 1, "010" becomes 10).
     - `mapToObj(String::valueOf)`: Converts the integer back to a string.
     - `collect(Collectors.joining("."))`: Joins the processed parts back together with "." as the delimiter to reconstruct the validated IP address string.


Key improvements:

- **Conciseness:**  Uses Java Streams for a more compact and readable solution.
- **Correctness:** Handles all cases of leading zeros, including single-digit parts and all-zero parts.
- **Clarity:**  Improved variable naming and comments for better understanding.
