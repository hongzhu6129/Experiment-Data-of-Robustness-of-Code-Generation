**Explanation and Educational Points:**

1. **`public static void main(String[] args)`:**  This is the entry point of every Java program.  The `args` array can hold command-line arguments, but we're not using them here.

2. **`Scanner` Class:** We use the `Scanner` class to get input from the user.  `System.in` represents the standard input stream (typically the keyboard). `scanner.nextFloat()` reads the next float value entered by the user.

3. **`round_num` Function:**
   - `public static float round_num(float num)`: This declares a function named `round_num` that takes a `float` as input and returns a `float`.
   - `Math.round(num)`: This is the core of the rounding logic. The `Math.round()` method in Java rounds a float to the nearest integer.  The result is also a `float` to maintain consistency with the return type.

4. **Output:** The rounded float value is printed to the console using `System.out.println()`.

5. **`scanner.close()`:**  It's good practice to close the `Scanner` when you're finished with it to release system resources.

**Example Usage:**

If the user enters `3.14159`, the output will be:
