Key improvements:

* **Handles null and empty strings:** The code now explicitly handles `null` and empty strings, avoiding potential `NullPointerException` or incorrect output.
* **Prints the reversed string:** The `reverseString` method directly prints the reversed string, making the output clear and concise.
* **Added test cases in `main`:**  Several test cases in the `main` method demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs, including empty, null, single-character, and multi-character strings.
* **Clearer base case:** The base case for the recursion is now more explicit, checking for both `null` and strings with length less than or equal to 1.
* **Newlines for clarity:** Newlines have been added after each test case in `main` to separate the outputs and make them easier to read.


This improved version is more robust, handles edge cases correctly, and provides clearer output, making it a more complete and usable solution.
