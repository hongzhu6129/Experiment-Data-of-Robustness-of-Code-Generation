**Explanation and Test Cases:**

1. **`concatenateStrings(String str1, String str2)` method:**
   - Takes two strings, `str1` and `str2`, as input.
   - Handles null and empty strings (or strings with length less than 1) by returning an empty string.  You could also throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if that's more appropriate for your use case.
   - Uses `substring(1)` to extract the portion of each string *after* the first character.
   - Concatenates the substrings and returns the result.

2. **Test Cases (using JUnit 5):**
   - **`testNormalCase()`:** Tests with regular strings.
   - **`testSingleCharacterStrings()`:**  Tests the edge case where the input strings have only one character each (the result should be empty).
   - **`testEmptyString()`:** Tests with empty strings.
   - **`testNullStrings()`:** Tests with null strings.  Essential to prevent `NullPointerExceptions`.
   - **`testStringsWithNumbersAndSpecialChars()`:** Checks if the function handles numbers and special characters correctly.
   - **`testStringsWithWhitespace()`:**  Important to check how leading/trailing spaces are handled.


**How to run the JUnit tests:**

If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you should be able to right-click on the class and select "Run 'StringConcatenationTest'".

If you're using the command line, you'll need to have JUnit 5 set up in your project. Then, you can compile and run the tests using a build tool like Maven or Gradle, or directly using the `java` command (after compiling the test class).


This revised answer provides a more robust solution with thorough testing, handling corner cases, and clear explanations. Remember to choose the appropriate way to handle invalid input (return empty string or throw an exception) depending on the requirements of your application.
