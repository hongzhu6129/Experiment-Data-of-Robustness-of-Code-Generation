**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles `null` and empty input arrays, returning 0 as the length in these cases.  This makes it more robust.

2. **Clearer Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` replaces `index` to clearly indicate its purpose - tracking the position for placing unique elements.

3. **Concise Return:** The code directly returns `uniqueIndex + 1`, simplifying the logic.

4. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** The `main` method now includes test cases for various scenarios (empty array, null array, array with no duplicates), demonstrating the code's correctness and handling of different situations.

5. **Output Formatting:** The output now uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant portion of the modified array, making the results cleaner and easier to interpret, especially in cases where the original array had duplicates removed.  It also handles printing "null" if the input array is null.


This revised version addresses the previous shortcomings and provides a more complete and correct solution. It's also well-tested and clearly explains how the code works.
