**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Null Handling:** The `removeString` method now checks for `null` inputs. If either `mainString` or `removeString` is `null`, it returns the original `mainString` to avoid a `NullPointerException`.  This makes the code more robust.

2. **`String.replace()`:** The core logic uses the built-in `String.replace()` method, which is the most efficient way to remove all occurrences of a substring. It automatically handles multiple occurrences.

3. **Clearer Test Cases:**  The `main` method includes more test cases, including examples with multiple occurrences of the `removeString`, as well as tests for null inputs. The output now includes quotes around the results, making it easier to see leading/trailing spaces.


This improved version is more concise, efficient, and handles edge cases effectively.
