This code leverages the `System.getProperty()` method to retrieve various Java environment properties.  Since this code compiles and runs (if Java is installed), it implicitly checks for Java's presence.  The output will display version information, vendor details, and other relevant data, confirming the installation.  The final print statement explicitly states this. If Java isn't installed, the code won't compile or run.
