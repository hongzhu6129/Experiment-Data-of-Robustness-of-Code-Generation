**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`isSumOfTwoCubes(int n, int a, int b)` function:**
   - This crucial helper function checks if `n` can be expressed as the sum of two cubes *other than* `a` and `b`. This is the core logic to determine if a number has multiple representations as the sum of two cubes.
2. **Avoiding duplicates:** The inner loop (`b`) now starts from `a + 1`. This avoids duplicate pairs like (1, 12) and (12, 1).
3. **Optimizations:**
   - `if (a3 > n) break;`: No need to check `a` values whose cube exceeds `n`.
   - `if (sum > n) break;`: No need to check `b` values if the sum already exceeds `n`.
4. **Clarity and Readability:**
   - Variable names are more descriptive (`a3`, `b3`, `sum`).
   - Comments explain the logic.
5. **Correctness:** 
   - The logic within `isSumOfTwoCubes` now correctly handles duplicate pairs and ensuring a distinct pair of cubes is found.


This improved version provides a more efficient and correct implementation to solve the Ramanujan number problem. It now specifically looks for numbers that can be represented as the sum of two cubes in *two (or more)* different ways, adhering to the problem's original intent.
