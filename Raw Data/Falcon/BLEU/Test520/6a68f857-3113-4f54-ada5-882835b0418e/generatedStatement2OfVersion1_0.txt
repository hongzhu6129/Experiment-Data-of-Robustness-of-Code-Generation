**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using names like `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` can be a bit confusing. More descriptive names like `firstNum`, `secondNum`, `thirdNum`, `fourthNum` would improve readability.

2. **Efficiency:** The original code has nested loops that can be optimized.  The provided code includes optimizations:
   - It breaks out of inner loops early if `a3`, `b3` or the sum exceed `n`. This avoids unnecessary calculations.
   - `b` starts from `a+1` to avoid duplicate pairs (e.g., 1^3 + 2^3 is the same as 2^3 + 1^3) and ensures that we find *distinct* pairs.

3. **Correct Output:**  The original code might not find *all* Ramanujan numbers or might print a number multiple times. The provided version ensures each number is printed only once when a second representation is found.

4. **Limit `n`:** Added the ability to specify the upper limit `n` directly in the code.

5. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic and optimizations.



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Compile using the Java compiler:  `javac Ramanujan.java`
3. **Run:**  `java Ramanujan`



This improved code is more efficient, finds the correct numbers, and is easier to understand.  If you change the value of `n`, you'll find more Ramanujan numbers.  The most famous is 1729 (the Hardy-Ramanujan number).
