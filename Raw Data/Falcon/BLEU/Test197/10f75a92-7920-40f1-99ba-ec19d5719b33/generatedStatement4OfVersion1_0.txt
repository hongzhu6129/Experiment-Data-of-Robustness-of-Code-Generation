Key points explained in the code and output:

1. **Creating a Map:** The `HashMap` class is used to create a map, which stores key-value pairs.  In this example, student names (Strings) are keys, and their grades (Integers) are values.

2. **`clear()` Method:** The core of this tutorial, `studentGrades.clear()`, removes all the key-value mappings from the map, making it empty.

3. **Checking for Emptiness:** `studentGrades.isEmpty()` is a useful method to verify whether a map contains any entries.  It returns `true` if the map is empty and `false` otherwise.

4. **Creating a New Map:**  After calling `clear()`, you can continue using the same map variable.  You can also create a completely new map by assigning a new `HashMap` instance to the variable (as shown in the last part of the example).

5. **Output:**  The output clearly demonstrates how the map goes from containing elements to being empty after the `clear()` method is invoked. The curly braces `{}` denote an empty map.
