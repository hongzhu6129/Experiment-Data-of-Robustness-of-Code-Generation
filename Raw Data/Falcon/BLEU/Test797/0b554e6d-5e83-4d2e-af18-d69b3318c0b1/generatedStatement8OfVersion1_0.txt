4. **Large Positive Integer:**
   - Input: `123456789`  (Testing potential integer overflow if calculations aren't handled carefully - though Java's `int` is large enough to accommodate this).
   - Expected Output: The correct scalar table up to 10.

5. **Large Negative Integer:**
   - Input: `-123456789` (Similar overflow check as above for negative values).
   - Expected Output: The correct scalar table up to 10.



**How to Run the Test Cases (Manual Testing):**

1.  Compile the Java code: `javac ScalarTable.java`
2.  Run the code: `java ScalarTable`
3.  Enter the input value when prompted.
4.  Compare the output with the expected output for each test case.


**Automated Testing (using JUnit - highly recommended for larger projects):**
