Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Clearer output:**  The output now explicitly states whether a security manager is present or not.  It also handles the case where an environment variable is not set.
* **Cross-platform compatibility for temp and username:** It accounts for the fact that the environment variable names for temporary directory and username can vary between operating systems (e.g., TEMP vs. TMP, USERNAME vs. USER).  While not perfectly exhaustive, it covers the most common cases.
* **Conciseness and Readability:** The code is well-formatted and easy to follow.
* **Correctness:** It uses the standard `System.getSecurityManager()` and `System.getenv()` methods to achieve the desired functionality.
