Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles null environment variables:** The original code would throw a `NullPointerException` if an environment variable wasn't set.  This version uses `if (variable != null)` checks to prevent this, printing a message if the variable isn't defined. This makes the code more robust and prevents crashes.
* **Clearer Output:**  The output is now more informative, specifically stating which environment variables are being printed.
* **Combined into a single `main` method:**  Both problem solutions are now integrated into one `main` method, as requested.



This revised code addresses the potential `NullPointerException`, provides more informative output, and is contained entirely within the `main` method.
