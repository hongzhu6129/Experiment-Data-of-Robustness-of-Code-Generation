Key improvements in this code:

* **Corrected `temp` property:**  The correct system property for the temporary directory is `java.io.tmpdir`.  "temp" is not a standard Java system property.
* **Clarity and Comments:**  Improved comments explain the purpose of each section and clarify the (sometimes subtle) difference between environment variables and system properties (especially relevant for `path`).
* **Error Handling:** Includes `null` checks for the properties to handle cases where they might not be defined, preventing potential `NullPointerExceptions`.
* **Combined into One `main` Method:** Both problems are addressed within a single `main` method as requested.


This revised version provides a more accurate and robust solution, addressing the specific system property names and providing better error handling.
