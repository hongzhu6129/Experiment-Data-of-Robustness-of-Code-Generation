Key improvements:

* **Correct Pattern:**  Accurately reproduces the given American flag pattern, including the "pct" in the center and the correct number of stars and stripes.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Uses meaningful variable names (`i`, `j`) and comments to explain the logic.
* **Efficiency:**  Avoids unnecessary repetitions by using loops effectively. 
* **Modularity:** Separates the stars and stripes printing into separate sections for easier modification if needed (e.g., to change the flag's dimensions).
* **Flexibility (pct):** The code now includes "pct" as requested.  You can easily change this three-character string if you need something different in the middle row.
