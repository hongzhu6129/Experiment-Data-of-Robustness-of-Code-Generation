To compile and run this:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CompareFilesLexicographically.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac CompareFilesLexicographically.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the program with the two file names as arguments:  `java CompareFilesLexicographically file1.txt file2.txt`  (Replace `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` with the actual paths to your files).


Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles different file lengths:**  Correctly compares files even if one is shorter than the other.
* **Clearer output:**  Provides more informative output messages.
* **Error handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` during file reading.
* **Uses `compareTo()`:** Uses the built-in `compareTo()` method for efficient string comparison. This handles character-by-character comparison according to Unicode values, ensuring correct lexicographical ordering.
* **Efficiency:**  Stops comparison as soon as a difference is found.  It doesn't need to read the entire files if a difference is found early on.
* **`try-with-resources`:** Uses try-with-resources to ensure that the file readers are closed automatically, even if exceptions occur.



This revised code provides a more robust and accurate solution for comparing files lexicographically.
