**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`TreeMap` for Sorted Data:**  A `TreeMap` is used to store the data because it keeps the keys sorted, which is crucial for efficiently getting a portion based on key comparisons.

2. **`headMap()` Method:** The `headMap(toKey, inclusive)` method of `TreeMap` is directly used. This method returns a view of the portion of the map whose keys are strictly less than `toKey` (if `inclusive` is `false`) or less than or equal to `toKey` (if `inclusive` is `true`).

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** The variable names are made more descriptive (`givenKey`, `inclusive`, `subMap`).

4. **Example Usage Demonstrated:** The `main` method shows how to use the `getPortion` method with different inputs (inclusive and exclusive,  and with a key not present in the map).

5. **`SortedMap` Return Type:**  The `getPortion` method returns a `SortedMap`. While the underlying map is a `TreeMap`, returning  `SortedMap` is generally better practice as it's a more general interface.


6. **Error Handling (Optional but Recommended):** In a real application, you might want to add error handling to `getPortion` in case the input `map` is null.  For example:
