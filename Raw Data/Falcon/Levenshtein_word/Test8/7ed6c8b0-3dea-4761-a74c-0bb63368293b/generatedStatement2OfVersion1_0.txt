Key improvements:

1. **Clearer Method Name:** `printSubArray` is more descriptive of what the method does.

2. **Handles Cases Without 10:**  The code now correctly handles arrays that don't contain the value 10.  It prints the entire original array in such cases.

3. **Improved Output Formatting:** Added a newline after each printed sub-array to make the output more readable.

4. **Multiple Test Cases in `main`:**  Demonstrates the functionality with several different example arrays to show how it handles various scenarios.

5. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain key parts of the logic.


This revised code is more robust, easier to understand, and produces cleaner output.
