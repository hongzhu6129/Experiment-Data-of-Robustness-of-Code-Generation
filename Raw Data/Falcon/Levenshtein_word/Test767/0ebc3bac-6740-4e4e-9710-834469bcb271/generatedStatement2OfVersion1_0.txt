Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Input Validation:** Added a check to ensure `k` is within a valid range (not negative, not larger than the array size). This prevents crashes or unexpected behavior.

2. **Two Methods:** Demonstrates two common approaches: sorting and using a min-heap (priority queue). Sorting is simpler for small `k` or when the array is already sorted, while the min-heap is generally more efficient for larger `k`.

3. **Avoiding Modification of Original Array:** Uses `Arrays.copyOf()` in the sorting method so that the original `arr` remains unchanged.

4. **Clearer Output:** Improved output formatting to clearly label the results of each method.

5. **Explanation of QuickSelect:**  Included a brief discussion of QuickSelect, explaining why it is not implemented directly in `main()` due to its recursive nature.  QuickSelect is typically the most efficient average case solution (O(n)) but has a worst-case of O(n^2) and is more complex to implement correctly.


How to run:

1. Save the code as `KLargestElements.java`.
2. Compile: `javac KLargestElements.java`
3. Run: `java KLargestElements`


This improved version addresses the original requirements and provides a more robust and informative solution.
