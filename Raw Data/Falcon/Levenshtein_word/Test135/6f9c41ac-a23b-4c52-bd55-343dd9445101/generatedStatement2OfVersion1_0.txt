Key improvements and explanations in this code:

1. **Clearer Node Class:** The `Node` class is defined explicitly for better structure and readability.  This is good practice when working with tree data structures.

2. **Recursive Approach:** The `maxDepth` method uses recursion, which is the standard and elegant way to traverse tree structures.

3. **Base Case:** The code handles the base case where `node` is `null` (empty tree or end of a branch) correctly, returning 0.

4. **Recursive Calls:** It recursively calls `maxDepth` on the left and right subtrees.

5. **Calculating Max:** `Math.max` is used to find the larger of the left and right subtree depths.

6. **Adding 1:** We add 1 to the maximum depth of the subtrees to account for the current node's level.

7. **Illustrative Main Method:** The `main` method provides examples of how to create binary trees and use the `maxDepth` method, making it easier to understand and test the code.
8. **Comments:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the logic clearly.
