Explanation and improvements in the code:

1. **Node Class:**  A `Node` class is created to represent the nodes of the binary tree.  Each node stores its data and references to its left and right children.

2. **maxDepth() Method:**
   - **Base Case:** If the `node` is `null` (empty tree or we've reached beyond a leaf), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Calls:**  We recursively call `maxDepth()` on the left and right subtrees.
   - **Return Max + 1:** We return the *larger* of the left subtree's depth and the right subtree's depth, and add 1 (to account for the current node).

3. **main() Method:**
   - A `BinaryTreeDepth` object is created.
   - Example binary trees are constructed to demonstrate the `maxDepth()` function.
   - The `maxDepth()` method is called with the root of the tree, and the result (the height/maximum depth) is printed.

4. **Clearer Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic of the `maxDepth()` function.

5. **More Test Cases:** Included an example of a skewed tree (which is essentially a linked list) to show how the code correctly handles unbalanced trees. This helps demonstrate the importance of the recursive approach.


This revised response provides a complete, well-commented, and more robust solution with a clear explanation. It adheres to the requested method signatures.
