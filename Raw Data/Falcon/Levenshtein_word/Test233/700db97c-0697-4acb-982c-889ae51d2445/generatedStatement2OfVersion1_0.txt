**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference (num1-num2)| Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Integers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 2. Negative Integers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 3. Mixed Signs | -10 | 5 | -5 | -15 | -50 | -2.0 | 0.0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | Division by zero error | Division by zero error |
| 6. Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13.0 | 8.0 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0.0 |
| 7. Large Numbers | 1000000 | 1000 | 1001000 | 999000 | 1000000000 | 1000.0 | 0.0 |
| 8. Small Numbers | 0.001 | 0.002 | 0.003 | -0.001 | 0.000002 | 0.5 | 0.0 |
| 9. Integer Overflow (potential) | Integer.MAX_VALUE | 1 |  Overflow behavior (depends on how Java handles it) |  |  |  |  |
| 10. Floating-point precision limitations | 0.1 | 0.2 | Approximately 0.3 (may not be exact due to floating-point representation) |  |  |  |  |


**How to Run the Test Cases:**

While you could manually input these values, a more efficient approach for testing is to write unit tests (e.g., using JUnit).  Here's a very basic example of how you might start creating a unit test for this code:
