## Test Cases:

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2 | 0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -5 | -2 | -7 | -3 | 10 | 2.5 | -1 (or 1 depending on implementation. Java uses truncated division)|
| 3. Mixed Signs | 8 | -3 | 5 | 11 | -24 | -2.666... | 2 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 7 | 7 | -7 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 | 12 | 0 | 12 | 12 | 0 | Division by zero error | Remainder undefined |  
| 6. Both Zero | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Division by zero error | Remainder undefined |
| 7. Large Numbers | 100000 | 5000 | 105000 | 95000 | 500000000 | 20 | 0 |
| 8. Decimal Numbers | 2.5 | 1.2 | 3.7 | 1.3 | 3 | 2.0833... | 0.1 (approx. due to floating-point limitations. Be mindful of how you compare floating point results in tests)|
| 9. Integer Overflow (potential issue) | Integer.MAX_VALUE | 1 | Overflow behavior (result might wrap around) |  | Overflow behavior |  |  |



**How to Run Test Cases:**

You can either manually input these values into your program or, better yet, create automated tests using a testing framework like JUnit. This allows for more robust and repeatable testing.
