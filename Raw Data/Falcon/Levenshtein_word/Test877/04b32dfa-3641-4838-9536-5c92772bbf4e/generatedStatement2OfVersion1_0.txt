Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Examples:** The code now demonstrates getting the current offset, creating a ZonedDateTime with a specific offset, parsing a ZonedDateTime string with an offset, and altering (adding to) the offset.
* **Improved Formatting:** The `formatOffset` method now correctly handles positive and negative offsets, adds leading zeros, and includes a colon separator, making the output much more readable (e.g., "+05:30", "-08:00").
* **Error Handling (Implicit):**  `ZonedDateTime.parse()` will throw an exception if the input string is not in a valid format. This is standard Java behavior, and you could add a `try-catch` block for more explicit handling if required.
* **Uses `java.time`:**  This is the modern Java date/time API and is preferred over older classes like `Date` and `Calendar`.



This revised answer provides more comprehensive examples and better output formatting, making it a more useful and practical solution.
