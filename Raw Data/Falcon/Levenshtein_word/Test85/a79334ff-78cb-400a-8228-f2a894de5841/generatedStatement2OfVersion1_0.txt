**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | num3 | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 23 | 32 | 43 | true |
| 2 | 17 | 27 | 55 | true |
| 3 | 1 | 11 | 21 | true |
| 4 | 10 | 20 | 30 | true |  // Corner case: numbers ending in 0
| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | true |  // Corner case: all zeros
| 6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | false |
| 7 | 12 | 23 | 34 | false |
| 8 | 123 | 456 | 789 | false |
| 9 | 100 | 201 | 302 | false | // Testing numbers with more than one digit where rightmost doesn't match
| 10 |  5 | 15 | 105 | true | // Testing numbers with differing numbers of digits
| 11 | 10 | 10 | 100 | true | // Another number of digit variation where rightmost two match


**Explanation of Corner Cases:**

* **Numbers ending in 0:**  Test case 4 checks if the code correctly handles numbers ending in 0.  The remainder when divided by 10 will be 0 for all of them, so the function should return `true`.
* **All zeros:** Test case 5 is another important corner case. All numbers are 0, and the function should return `true`.
* **Numbers with different numbers of digits:** Test cases 10 and 11 ensure the code isn't influenced by the overall magnitude of the number but focuses only on the rightmost digit.


This set of test cases helps ensure the `function` and the main program logic are robust and handle a variety of inputs correctly.  You can run these test cases through your Java program to validate its correctness.
