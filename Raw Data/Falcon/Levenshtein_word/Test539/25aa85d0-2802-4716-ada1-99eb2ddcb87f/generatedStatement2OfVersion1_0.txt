This improved code directly addresses the problem statement's core requirement: finding a number expressible as the sum of two cubes in *two or more* distinct ways.  It efficiently avoids redundant calculations and prints each such number only once.  The `break` statements optimize the search by stopping the inner loops when a solution is found or the inner loop can no longer find an integer cube root.
