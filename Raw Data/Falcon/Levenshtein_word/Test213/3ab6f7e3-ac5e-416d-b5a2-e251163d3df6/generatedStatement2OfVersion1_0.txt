Key improvements and explanations in this revised code:

* **Handles Empty and Null Input:**  The code now correctly handles cases where the input `String[] words` is `null` or an empty array.  It returns an empty `ArrayList` in these situations.
* **Clearer Logic:** The logic for finding the longest words is more streamlined and readable.
* **Uses `String.join()` for Output:** The `String.join()` method provides a concise way to format the output with commas. 
* **More Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method includes more test cases to demonstrate the handling of different input scenarios (including null and empty arrays).
* **Efficiency:** The code iterates through the `words` array only once, making it efficient.



This improved version addresses potential issues and provides a more robust and user-friendly solution.
