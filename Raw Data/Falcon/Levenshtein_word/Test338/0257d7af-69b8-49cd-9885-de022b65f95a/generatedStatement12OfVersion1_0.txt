**How to run the test cases (without a formal testing framework):**

1. **Manual Testing:**  The simplest way is to run the program multiple times, entering each test input and visually comparing the output with the expected output.

2. **Automated Testing (recommended for larger projects):** Use a testing framework like JUnit. This involves writing separate test methods for each case, using assertions to automatically verify the correctness of the output.  Example using JUnit: (This requires adding JUnit to your project)
