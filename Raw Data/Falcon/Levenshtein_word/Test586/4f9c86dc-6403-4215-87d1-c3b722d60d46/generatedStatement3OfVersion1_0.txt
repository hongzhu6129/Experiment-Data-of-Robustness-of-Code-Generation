This JUnit test demonstrates how to capture the output of `printFace()` and compare it with the expected string.  This makes testing more robust and repeatable than just visual inspection.  You would need to add JUnit to your project to run this test.


The provided test cases cover the essential aspects of verifying that the `printFace()` function produces the intended visual output and handles potential character encoding variations.  The JUnit example shows a more advanced and automated way to test output in Java.
