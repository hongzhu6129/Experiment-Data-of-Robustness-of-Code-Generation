**Key Idea for Testing Output:**

The best approach for thoroughly testing console output in Java usually involves redirecting `System.out` to a `ByteArrayOutputStream`. This captures the output and lets you compare it to an expected string. However, for this simple example, the conceptual approach with potential component-level tests provides a good starting point for considering edge cases and robustness.  The complexity of output testing often outweighs the benefits for very simple output scenarios like this one.
