This JUnit example demonstrates how to create test methods to verify the `calculatePerimeter` (you would also create a `calculateArea` method and test it similarly).  The `assertEquals` method checks if the calculated value is within a small delta (tolerance) of the expected value, which is essential when comparing floating-point numbers. The `testInvalidRadius` tests the case where a negative radius is given as input, verifying if an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown. Adapt the test cases and expected exceptions to match your exact error handling implementation.


By running these tests (in an IDE or using a build tool), you can ensure that your program behaves correctly under different conditions and quickly identify and fix any issues.
