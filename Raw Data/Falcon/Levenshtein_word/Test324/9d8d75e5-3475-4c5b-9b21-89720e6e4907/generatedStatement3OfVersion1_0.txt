4. **Large Radius:**
   - Input: radius = 1000000
   - Expected Output: (Check against a calculator to verify correctness with large numbers). This helps ensure your calculations are accurate with large inputs.


5. **Small Radius:**
   - Input: radius = 0.000001
   - Expected Output: (Verify against a calculator) Test for potential rounding errors or issues with very small values.


6. **Boundary/Edge Cases (if using integer input):**
   - Input:  Integer.MAX_VALUE (Largest possible Java integer)
   - Expected Behavior: Test for potential overflow issues.  You might consider using `double` for radius to handle a wider range.  If an overflow occurs, Java won't throw an exception, but the results will be incorrect.


**How to run test cases:**

- **Manually:** You can run these test cases by entering the input values one at a time and checking the output.
- **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  Using a testing framework like JUnit is a much better approach.  JUnit allows you to write test methods that automatically run your code with different inputs and verify the outputs against expected values. This is much more efficient and reliable than manual testing, especially for more complex programs.


Example of a JUnit test (you would need to add the JUnit library to your project):
