**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases designed to cover different scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Standard Case (Positive Radius):**
   - Input: radius = 7.5 (as provided)
   - Expected Output: 
     - Perimeter: approximately 47.1238898
     - Area: approximately 176.7145867

2. **Zero Radius:**
   - Input: radius = 0
   - Expected Output:
     - Perimeter: 0
     - Area: 0

3. **Negative Radius (Invalid Input):**
   - Input: radius = -5
   - Expected Behavior:  While the code will technically run and produce results, a negative radius doesn't make sense geometrically.  Ideally, you should add input validation to handle this.  For example:
