Key improvements:

* **Handles negative numbers:** Using `Math.abs()` ensures correct sum calculation regardless of input sign.
* **Clearer output:** Adds a space between the digit words and a newline at the end for better readability.
* **Error Handling (within print_number):** Includes a basic check within `print_number` to handle potential issues (though it's unlikely to be reached in normal execution because of the way digits are extracted).  This makes the function more robust.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `input.close()` after it's no longer needed, which is good practice.



If you are limited to Java 7 or earlier and cannot use `try-with-resources` for the `Scanner`, closing it explicitly with `input.close()` is the correct approach for resource management.
