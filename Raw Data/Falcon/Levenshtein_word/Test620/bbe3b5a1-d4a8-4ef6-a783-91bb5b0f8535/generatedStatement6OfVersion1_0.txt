**Key Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes input validation. It checks if the user provides the correct number of arguments and if the input is a positive integer.  This prevents crashes due to bad input.
* **Clear Usage Message:**  If the user runs the program incorrectly, it provides a helpful usage message.
* **Adherence to Method Signatures:** The code strictly follows the specified method signatures: `main(String[])` and `printMatrix(int)`.
* **Clarity and Readability:**  Comments and consistent formatting make the code easier to understand.


This improved version is more robust and user-friendly. It addresses potential errors and provides a clearer way to use the program.
