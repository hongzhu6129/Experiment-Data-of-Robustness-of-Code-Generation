**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Comparator Implementation:** The `compare` method now correctly parses the date strings ("YYYY-MM-DD") into year, month, and day components. This ensures accurate chronological sorting. It uses `Integer.parseInt` and `Integer.compare` for robust integer comparisons.

2. **Method Reference:** The `TreeMap` is initialized using a method reference (`new TreeTimelineSorter()::compare`). This is a concise and elegant way to pass the `compare` method as the `Comparator` for the `TreeMap`.

3. **Clearer Example:** The `main` method demonstrates how to add entries to the `TreeMap` and then iterate through the sorted keys to print the timeline.

4. **Error Handling (Optional):**  For production code, you might consider adding error handling within the `compare` method to handle potential `NumberFormatException` if the date strings are not in the expected format.


This revised code provides a more accurate and robust solution for sorting keys in a tree timeline using a custom comparator while adhering to the specified method signature constraints.
