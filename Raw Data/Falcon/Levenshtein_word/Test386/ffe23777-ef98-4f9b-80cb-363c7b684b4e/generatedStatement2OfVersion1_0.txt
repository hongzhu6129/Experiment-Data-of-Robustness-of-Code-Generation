Key improvements and explanations:

* **Handles Invalid Input:** The code now explicitly checks for `null` and strings with lengths less than 3 and returns `null`.  Returning `null` is a common way to signal an invalid input. You could also throw an exception like `IllegalArgumentException` if that better suits your error handling strategy.
* **Java Version Compatibility:** Includes a `copyLastThreeLegacy` method that uses a `StringBuilder` for Java versions prior to 11 (which don't have the `String.repeat()` method).  This ensures broader compatibility.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The JUnit tests now cover several cases:
    * **Valid strings:**  Strings of length 3 or more.
    * **Short strings:** Strings with length less than 3.
    * **Null strings:**  Testing for `null` input.
    * **Special Characters:** Strings containing special characters like "!", "@", "#", spaces, etc. This ensures your code handles various input types correctly.
* **Clearer `main` Method:** The `main` method now demonstrates both valid and invalid input cases.
* **Uses JUnit:**  Using JUnit for testing is highly recommended for robust code development.  The provided test cases show how to use JUnit assertions (`assertEquals`, `assertNull`).  You can run these tests directly in most IDEs (like IntelliJ or Eclipse).


How to run the JUnit tests:

1. Make sure you have JUnit 5 (or Jupiter) set up in your project (most IDEs make this very easy).
2. Create a new Java class (e.g., `StringCopyTest.java`) and paste the code into it.
3. Run the tests from your IDE.  The IDE will show the results of each test, indicating any failures.


This improved version is more robust, handles edge cases, and is well-tested, which are essential for production-ready code.
