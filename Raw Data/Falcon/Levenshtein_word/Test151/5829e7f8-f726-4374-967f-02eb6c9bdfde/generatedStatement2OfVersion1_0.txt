**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`checkSum` Method:** This method takes three integers as input and returns `true` if the sum of the first two equals the third, and `false` otherwise.  This improves code organization and makes the logic reusable.

2. **User Input:** The code now uses a `Scanner` to get input from the user, making it interactive.

3. **Clear Output:** The output messages clearly state whether the sum is equal to the third integer or not.

4. **Resource Management:** The `scanner.close()` statement is crucial for closing the `Scanner` and preventing resource leaks.

5. **Error Handling (Optional):**  For more robust code, you could add error handling to check if the user's input is actually an integer.  You could use a `try-catch` block to handle `InputMismatchException`.
