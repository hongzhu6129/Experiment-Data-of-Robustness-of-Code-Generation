Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Regular Expression:** The regular expression is now more focused and easier to understand. It specifically targets the three common formats without unnecessary complexity.
* **Conciseness:** The code is more concise and avoids redundant checks.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** The `main` method includes tests for various valid and invalid phone number formats to demonstrate the validator's functionality.
* **Adherence to Requirements:**  The solution strictly adheres to the requested method signatures.


This revised solution is more efficient, robust, and easier to maintain while fulfilling all the original requirements.
