Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct Handling of Ternary Nodes:**  The `maxDepth` function now correctly considers the middle child (`node.mid`) when calculating the maximum depth.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `leftDepth`, `midDepth`, and `rightDepth` makes the code easier to follow.
* **Simplified Logic:** The `Math.max` calls are combined for better readability.
* **Added Test Cases:**  The `main` method includes two test cases: one with a more general tree structure and one with a skewed tree, demonstrating that the code handles different tree shapes correctly.
* **Comments:** Explanatory comments are added to crucial parts for better understanding.
