**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | Input 1 | Input 2 | Input 3 | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 20.0 | Standard positive numbers |
| 2 | -5 | 0 | 5 | 0.0 | Includes negative and zero |
| 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0 | All zeros |
| 4 | 1.5 | 2.5 | 3.5 | 2.5 | Decimal numbers |
| 5 | Double.MAX_VALUE | Double.MAX_VALUE | Double.MAX_VALUE | Double.MAX_VALUE  | Very large positive number |
| 6 | Double.MIN_VALUE | Double.MIN_VALUE | Double.MIN_VALUE | Double.MIN_VALUE  | Very small positive number (close to zero) |
| 7 | -Double.MAX_VALUE | -Double.MAX_VALUE | -Double.MAX_VALUE | -Double.MAX_VALUE  | Very large negative numbers  |
| 8 | Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY | 10 | 20 | Infinity |  Handles Infinity |
| 9 | Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY | 10 | 20 | -Infinity | Handles Negative Infinity |
| 10 | Double.NaN | 10 | 20 | NaN | Handles NaN (Not a Number) |



**How to run the test cases:**

While you can manually input these values into the program, a better approach is to create automated tests.  Here's how you can write a simple JUnit test:
