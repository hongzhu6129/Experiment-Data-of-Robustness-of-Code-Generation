**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner/edge cases:

1. **Regular Case:**
   - Input: 10, 20, 30
   - Expected Output: 20.0

2. **Zero Values:**
   - Input: 0, 0, 0
   - Expected Output: 0.0

3. **Negative Numbers:**
   - Input: -10, -20, -30
   - Expected Output: -20.0

4. **Mixed Positive and Negative:**
   - Input: -10, 20, 30
   - Expected Output: 13.333333333333334

5. **Large Numbers:**
   - Input: 1000000, 2000000, 3000000
   - Expected Output: 2000000.0

6. **Decimal Numbers:**
   - Input: 2.5, 5.7, 8.9
   - Expected Output: 5.7

7. **Edge Case (potential overflow with integers -  less likely with doubles but good to consider if using int):**
   - Input: Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE  (If you were using `int` this would likely overflow)
   - Expected Output: With doubles: 2.147483647E9 (approx)



**How to Run the Test Cases:**

You can manually enter these values when prompted by the program.  For more automated testing, you could create a separate test class (using JUnit or TestNG, for example) that calls the `calculateAverage()` method with these inputs and asserts that the returned value matches the expected output.  This is the recommended approach for larger projects.



Example of a simple JUnit test (you'd need to add the JUnit library to your project):
