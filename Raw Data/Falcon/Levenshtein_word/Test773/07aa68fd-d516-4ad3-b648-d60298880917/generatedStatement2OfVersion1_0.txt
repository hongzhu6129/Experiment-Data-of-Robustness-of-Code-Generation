**Test Cases:**

1. **Valid Octal Number:**
   - Input: 123
   - Expected Output: Hexadecimal equivalent: 53

2. **Leading Zeros:**
   - Input: 000123
   - Expected Output: Hexadecimal equivalent: 53

3. **Zero:**
   - Input: 0
   - Expected Output: Hexadecimal equivalent: 0

4. **Large Octal Number:**
   - Input: 7777777
   - Expected Output: Hexadecimal equivalent: FFFFFF

5. **Invalid Octal Number (Containing digits other than 0-7):**
   - Input: 1283
   - Expected Output: Invalid octal number: Invalid octal digit: 8

6. **Invalid Octal Number (Negative Number):**
   - Input: -123  (Note: The program doesn't explicitly handle negative octals; it will treat them as positive.)
   - Expected Output: Will treat it as positive and might give unexpected results (This is something you might want to explicitly handle by checking for a leading '-' and throwing an error).

7. **Empty Input:**
   - Input:  (Just press enter)
   - Expected Output:  (The Scanner might throw an exception, or it might handle it gracefully depending on the Java version. Ideally, you should add a check for empty input in your program).

8. **Input with spaces:** 
   - Input:  12 3
   - Expected Output:  (The Scanner's `nextLine()` will take the entire "12 3" as input. This will result in "Invalid octal number" because of the space.)



**Explanation of Key Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now uses a `try-catch` block to handle `NumberFormatException` if the input isn't a valid octal number.  This prevents the program from crashing and provides a more user-friendly message.
* **Handles Zero:**  Added a check to specifically handle the input `0` so that the correct hexadecimal equivalent `0` is printed.
* **Clearer Prompts and Output:** Added prompts and output messages to improve the user experience.
* **Documentation:** Added comments to make the code more readable and explain the steps involved in the conversion.


This improved version is much more robust and handles a wider range of inputs. Remember to test your code with a variety of inputs to ensure it works correctly in all cases.
