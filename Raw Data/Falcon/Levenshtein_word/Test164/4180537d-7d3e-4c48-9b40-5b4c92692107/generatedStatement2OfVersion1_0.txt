Key improvements in this version:

* **Input Validation:**  It now includes error handling for invalid date formats using a `try-catch` block. This prevents the program from crashing if the user enters an incorrect date.
* **Clearer Prompts and Output:**  The prompts and output messages are more informative, making it easier for the user to understand what to input and what the result means.
* **Standard Date/Time API:** It uses the modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8), which is the recommended way to handle dates and times in Java.  It's much cleaner and more reliable than older classes like `Date` and `Calendar`.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `GetDayOfWeek.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using: `javac GetDayOfWeek.java`
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program using: `java GetDayOfWeek`

The program will then prompt you to enter a date.
