**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly uses `public int maxDepth(Node)` and `public static void main(String[])` as required.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The `maxDepth` method (though the name isn't ideal for breadth, we're stuck with it) now correctly implements BFS using a `Queue`. This is the standard approach for finding the maximum breadth (or level width) of a tree.
3. **Level-Order Traversal:**  The core logic involves processing the tree level by level. `levelSize` tracks the number of nodes at each level.
4. **Max Breadth Update:** Inside the `while` loop, `maxBreadth = Math.max(maxBreadth, levelSize);`  updates the `maxBreadth` with the largest level size encountered so far.
5. **Clearer Node Class:** The `Node` class is now more concise and standard.
6. **Illustrative Main Method:** The `main` method demonstrates how to create a sample tree and call the `maxDepth` method to get the result.  I've added a second test case as well.
7. **Correct Naming:** While the method name `maxDepth` is not perfect for calculating maximum breadth, it's the given constraint. It's crucial to understand it computes *breadth*, not *depth*.


This improved version addresses the previous shortcomings and provides a correct and efficient solution to the problem within the given method signature constraints.  It's also more robust with better examples and comments.
