Key improvements in this version:

* **Try-with-resources:**  This ensures that the file resources (both `FileWriter` and `FileReader`) are closed automatically, even if exceptions occur. This is crucial for preventing resource leaks.
* **Clearer error handling:** The `catch` blocks now print more informative error messages.
* **Combined writing and reading:**  The code demonstrates both writing and reading in a single `main` method, making it easier to see the complete flow.
* **`\n` for newlines:** Uses `\n` explicitly for newlines, ensuring consistent behavior across different operating systems.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the code.
* **Informative output:** The code now prints messages to indicate whether the file was written/read successfully.
