**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **`removeElement` Method:**
   - Uses a `k` variable as a pointer to build the new array in-place within the original array.
   - Iterates through the original array. If an element is *not* equal to `val`, it's copied to the `k`-th position, and `k` is incremented.  This effectively overwrites elements equal to `val`.
   - Returns `k`, which is the length of the new array (number of elements not equal to `val`).

2. **`main` Method:**
   - Creates a sample array.
   - Calls `removeElement` to modify the array and get the new length.
   - Prints the original array (to demonstrate the in-place modification).
   - Prints the new length.
   - **Added (optional but recommended):**  Creates a new array `newArray` using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to get only the relevant part (the first `newLength` elements) of the modified array. This makes it clearer to see what the effective "new" array looks like after removing the elements.  This is especially helpful for visualization and debugging.
