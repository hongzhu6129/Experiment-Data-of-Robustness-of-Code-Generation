**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner/edge cases:

1. **Example Case:**
   - lat1: 25, lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5, lon2: 25.5
   - lat3: 10, lon3: -5
   - Expected distance12: ~1480.08 km
   - Expected distance13: ~2885.96 km
   - Expected distance23: ~4273.05 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40, lon1: -70
   - lat2: 40, lon2: -70
   - lat3: 40, lon3: -70
   - Expected distance12: 0 km
   - Expected distance13: 0 km
   - Expected distance23: 0 km

3. **North/South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90, lon1: 0  (North Pole)
   - lat2: -90, lon2: 0 (South Pole) 
   - lat3: 0, lon3: 0   (Equator)
   - Expected distance12: ~20015.09 km (half the Earth's circumference)
   - Expected distance13: ~10007.54 km (quarter of the Earth's circumference)
   - Expected distance23: ~10007.54 km

4. **Antipodes (opposite sides of the Earth):**
   - lat1: 45, lon1: 20
   - lat2: -45, lon2: -160
   - lat3: 0, lon3: 90
   - Expected distance12: ~20015.09 km (approximately the Earth's diameter)
   - Expected distance (to illustrate varying distances with a 3rd point): ~Varies depending on lat3, lon3


5. **Longitude wrapping (180/-180 degrees):**
   - lat1: 0, lon1: 179
   - lat2: 0, lon2: -179
   - lat3: 0, lon3: 0
   - Expected distance12: ~222.64 km (a short distance due to longitude wrap)
   - Expected distance: ~Varies depending on lat3, lon3


6. **Invalid Input (optional - you could add input validation to your code):**
   - lat1: 91, lon1: 200  (Latitude out of range)


By testing these different scenarios, you can verify that your `distance` function calculates distances accurately and handles edge cases correctly.  You can add error handling to your code to deal with invalid latitude/longitude input if needed.
