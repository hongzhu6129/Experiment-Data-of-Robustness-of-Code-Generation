Key improvements and explanations:

1. **`isCube()` function:** Separates the cube-checking logic into a dedicated function, making the code more organized and reusable.

2. **Handling negative numbers:** The `isCube()` function now correctly handles negative numbers by checking the cube of their absolute values.

3. **Efficient cube root calculation:** The code uses `Math.cbrt()` and `Math.round()` to efficiently calculate the integer cube root. This is significantly faster than the iterative approach, especially for large numbers.

4. **Clearer output:** The output messages are more informative and now address the ambiguous "or should" part of the problem description.

5. **Commented-out less efficient alternative:** The iterative method is included as a comment for comparison, highlighting the efficiency of the `Math.cbrt()` method.
