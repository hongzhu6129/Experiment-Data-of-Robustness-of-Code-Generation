Key Improvements in this version:

* **Handles negative numbers correctly:**  The `cbrt()` method correctly calculates the cube root of negative numbers.
* **More efficient:** Using `cbrt()` is more direct and computationally efficient than iterating or using `Math.pow()` with fractional exponents.
* **Clearer integer checking:** The `cubeRoot == Math.round(cubeRoot)` comparison is a concise way to check if `cubeRoot` is an integer.
* **Example usage:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `isCube()` method with different test cases.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic more clearly.
