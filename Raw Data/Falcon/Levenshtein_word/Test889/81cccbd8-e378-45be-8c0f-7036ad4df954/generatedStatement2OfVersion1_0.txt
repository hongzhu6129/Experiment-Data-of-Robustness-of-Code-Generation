Key improvements in this revised code:

* **Clearer Variable Names:** Uses more descriptive variable names (e.g., `lowerIndex`, `higherIndex`) for better readability.
* **Concise Comments:** Comments are more focused and explain the logic clearly without being excessive.
* **Standard Pivot Selection:**  Uses the middle element as the pivot to generally avoid worst-case scenarios.
* **Handles Empty/Null Input:** Includes a check at the beginning of `sort()` to handle empty or null input arrays gracefully.
* **Prints Output:**  The `main` method now prints the sorted array to the console, making it easier to verify the results.
