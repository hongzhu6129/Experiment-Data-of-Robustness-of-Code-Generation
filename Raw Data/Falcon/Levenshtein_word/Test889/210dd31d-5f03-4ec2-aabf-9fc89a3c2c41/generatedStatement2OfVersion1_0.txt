Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:** Checks for `null` or empty input array.
* **Clearer variable names:**  Uses `lowerIndex` and `higherIndex` for better readability.
* **Median-of-three pivot selection (partially implemented):**  The pivot is now chosen as the middle element between `lowerIndex`, `higherIndex`, and their average. This helps mitigate worst-case scenarios for already sorted or nearly sorted data (although a full median-of-three would also compare values).
* **In-place swapping:** The `exchangeNumbers` method now takes the array as an argument, making the swap operation directly within the array.
* **Output:** The `main` method now prints the sorted array to the console.
* **Comments:** Added more explanatory comments throughout the code.


This revised code is more robust and demonstrates a closer-to-optimal implementation of Quick Sort.  It addresses the potential StackOverflowError by avoiding deeply nested recursive calls in the worst-case scenarios.
