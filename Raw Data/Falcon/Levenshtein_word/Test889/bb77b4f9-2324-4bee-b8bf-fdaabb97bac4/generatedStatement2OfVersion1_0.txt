Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:** Checks for `null` or empty input array.
* **Clearer variable names:** Uses `lowerIndex` and `higherIndex` instead of `i` and `j` at the top level of `quickSort`.  `i` and `j` are still used within the partitioning loop, as is conventional.
* **Explicit pivot selection:** Calculates the pivot using the middle index to mitigate worst-case scenarios with already sorted or nearly sorted data.
* **Comments:**  Explains the partitioning logic in more detail.
* **Recursive calls:** Properly handles the recursive calls to `quickSort` for the sub-arrays.
* **`exchangeNumbers` method:**  Takes the array as an argument for proper swapping.
* **Output:**  Prints the sorted array to the console using `Arrays.toString()` for easy verification.



This improved version is more robust, readable, and efficient than the previous iterations. It demonstrates a standard implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm.
