Key improvements:

* **Handles Floating-Point Strings:** Parses the input as a `double` first using `Double.parseDouble()`, then casts to an `int`.  This handles the "3.0" case correctly (truncating the decimal portion).
* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-catch` block to catch `NumberFormatException`.  This prevents your program from crashing if the input string isn't a valid number.  You can choose to print an error message or throw an exception as needed.
* **Comprehensive Test Cases:** Includes a variety of test cases covering normal numbers, negative numbers, zero, large numbers, floating-point numbers, and invalid input strings (empty, non-numeric, multiple decimal points).  Also includes tests for `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` to demonstrate handling of integer range limits.  The added test case for a value just outside the `int` range shows how to manage potential overflow.


This revised code is more robust and handles the original error, as well as several other potential issues with string-to-integer conversion. Remember to consider how you want to handle out-of-range numbers (throw an exception, return a special value, or saturate the result).
