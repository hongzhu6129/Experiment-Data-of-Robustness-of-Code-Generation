**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`TreeSet` for Efficiency:**  A `TreeSet` is used to store the numbers because it automatically maintains the elements in sorted order, which can be beneficial for certain operations (though not strictly necessary here).

2. **Clear Method Signature:** The `main` method is kept as the entry point, and a helper method `findFarFromSeven` is introduced to encapsulate the logic of finding numbers far from 7.

3. **Absolute Difference:** The `Math.abs()` function calculates the absolute difference between each number and 7. This ensures that we're considering distances in both directions (greater than and less than 7).

4. **Clearer Output:** The output is made more descriptive to indicate what "far than 7" means (in this case, an absolute difference greater than 2).

5. **Iterating through the TreeSet:** The enhanced `for` loop (for-each loop) is used to efficiently iterate through the elements of the `TreeSet`.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.java` file (e.g., `FarFromSeven.java`).
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using the Java compiler:
