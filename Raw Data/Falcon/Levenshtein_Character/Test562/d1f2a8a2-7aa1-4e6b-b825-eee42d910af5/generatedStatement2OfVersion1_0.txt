Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clear Node Class:** A separate `Node` class is defined to represent the structure of a binary tree node.  This is standard practice and makes the code more organized.

2. **Recursive `maxDepth` function:**  The core logic remains recursive.  The base case is when the `node` is `null` (empty subtree), returning 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the depth of the left and right subtrees and returns 1 + the maximum of the two depths.

3. **Main Method with Examples:** The `main` method now includes the creation of a sample binary tree and a call to `maxDepth` to demonstrate the functionality.  I've added a second example of a "skewed" (like a linked list) tree to show that the code correctly handles unbalanced trees.

4. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic and the purpose of different parts of the code.

5. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Used more descriptive variable names (e.g., `lDepth`, `rDepth`).


This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and follows best practices for Java code structure.
