Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Problem Description Handling:** The original prompt was a little ambiguous ("maximum measuring"). This version clearly addresses finding the *maximum depth* (or height) of a binary tree, which is a standard tree problem.
* **Improved Code Style:**  Uses more standard Java naming conventions (e.g., `lDepth`, `rDepth`) and better spacing for readability.
* **More Comprehensive Example:** Includes two example trees in the `main` method: a more balanced tree and a more imbalanced one to demonstrate how the `maxDepth` function handles different tree structures.
* **Conciseness:**  The code is now more concise and avoids unnecessary intermediate variables while maintaining clarity.
* **Correctness:** The recursive logic is verified and corrected to accurately calculate the maximum depth.
