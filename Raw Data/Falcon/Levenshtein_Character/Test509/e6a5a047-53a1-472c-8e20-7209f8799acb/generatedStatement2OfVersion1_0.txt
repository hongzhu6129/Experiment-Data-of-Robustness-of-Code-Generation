Key improvements and explanations in this educational version:

1. **Clear Method Documentation:**  The `removeDuplicates` method now has a Javadoc comment explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code explicitly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays, returning 0 in those cases.  This makes the code more robust.

3. **Illustrative `main` Method:**  The `main` method demonstrates the usage of `removeDuplicates` with multiple examples, including the edge cases and a case where the array is already unique.  It also clearly prints the results in an understandable format using `Arrays.toString` and `Arrays.copyOfRange`. This latter function is *crucial* to only printing the relevant part of the array because the original array is modified in place.

4. **In-Place Modification (Important Note):** The `removeDuplicates` method modifies the input array *in place*.  The elements beyond the new length are not necessarily removed or cleared; they're just not considered part of the new, shortened array. The `main` method demonstrates this by carefully only printing the first `len` elements.

5. **Clear Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` instead of just `i` or `j` makes the code easier to follow.

6. **Explanatory Comments:** Concise comments within the `removeDuplicates` method clarify the logic, particularly regarding how `uniqueIndex` is used.


This improved version provides a more educational and comprehensive demonstration of how to remove duplicates from a sorted array while adhering to the specified method signatures.
