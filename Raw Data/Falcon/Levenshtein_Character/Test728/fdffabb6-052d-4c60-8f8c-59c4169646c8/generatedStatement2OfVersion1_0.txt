Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Siamese Method:** The code now correctly implements the Siamese method (or De la Loubere method) for generating odd-order magic squares.  This is a standard and efficient algorithm.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** Variable names (`i`, `j`, `num`) are now more descriptive.

3. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic, especially the wrap-around conditions.

4. **Error Handling:** Includes a check for even `n` and prints an error message, as even-order magic squares (except for a few trivial cases) cannot be generated by this method.

5. **Magic Constant Calculation:**  Prints the magic constant for verification.

6. **Formatting:** Improved output formatting using `printf` for aligned numbers in the grid.



How to use:

1. **Compile:**  Save the code as `MagicSquare.java` and compile it: `javac MagicSquare.java`
2. **Run:**  `java MagicSquare`

You can change the value of `n` in the `main` method to generate magic squares of different odd orders.
