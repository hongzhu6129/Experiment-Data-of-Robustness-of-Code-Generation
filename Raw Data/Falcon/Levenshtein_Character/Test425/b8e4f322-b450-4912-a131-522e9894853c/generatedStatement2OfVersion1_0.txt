Key improvements in this revised code:

- **Handles multiple date formats:** It uses an array of `DateTimeFormatter` objects to attempt parsing with different patterns. This makes it more flexible and able to handle various date/time string formats.
- **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block prevents the program from crashing if a date string cannot be parsed.  It provides a message indicating the parsing failure.
- **Clear output:** The output clearly labels the original date string, extracted date, and extracted time, making it easier to understand the results.
- **Uses `LocalDateTime`:**  This is generally preferred over older date/time classes as it's part of the modern Java time API (java.time).
- **More efficient loop exit:** The `break` statement exits the inner loop as soon as a successful parsing is found, avoiding unnecessary iterations.


How to use it:

1. **Modify `dateStrings`:**  Replace the example date strings with the actual date strings you want to extract date and time from.
2. **Add more formatters (if needed):** If your date strings have different formats, add more `DateTimeFormatter` objects to the `formatters` array with the appropriate patterns.  Refer to the Java documentation for `DateTimeFormatter` for pattern syntax.
3. **Run the code:**  Compile and run the Java program. The output will display the extracted date and time for each valid date string.
