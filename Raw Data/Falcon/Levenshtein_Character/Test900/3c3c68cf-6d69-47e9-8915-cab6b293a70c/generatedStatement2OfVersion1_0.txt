Explanation:

1. **Node Class:** Represents a node in the binary tree. It has `data`, `left` child, and `right` child.

2. **BinaryTree Class:**
   - `root`: Stores the root of the binary tree.
   - `maxDepth(Node node)`: This recursive method calculates the maximum depth.
     - **Base Case:** If `node` is null (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
     - **Recursive Step:**  It recursively calls `maxDepth` for the left and right subtrees. The depth of the current node is 1 plus the maximum of the depths of its left and right subtrees.

3. **main Method:**
   - Creates a sample binary tree.  You can change this to test with different tree structures.
   - Calls the `maxDepth` method to find the height (maximum depth) and prints the result.
