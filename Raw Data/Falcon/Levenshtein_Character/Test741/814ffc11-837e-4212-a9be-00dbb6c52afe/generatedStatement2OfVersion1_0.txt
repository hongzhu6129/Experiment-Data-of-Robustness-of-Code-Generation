**Explanation:**

1. **`main` Method:** The program's entry point.
2. **`isCube` Method:** This helper method determines whether a given integer is a perfect cube.
   - **Negative Numbers:**  The code handles negative numbers correctly by checking the cube of the absolute value.
   - **`Math.cbrt()` (Recommended):** It uses `Math.cbrt()` to calculate the cube root. If the cube root is an integer (no fractional part), the number is a perfect cube. This is the most efficient way.
   - **Alternative Looping Method (Less Efficient):** The commented-out section demonstrates an alternative using a `while` loop to iterate through cubes until the cube is greater than or equal to the input number. If equality is found, the number is a perfect cube.  The `Math.cbrt` method is generally preferred for efficiency.


**How to compile and run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `CubeChecker.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac CubeChecker.java`
3. **Run:**  `java CubeChecker`



This improved version directly addresses the prompt's requirement of using the `main` method signature and provides both a hardcoded example as presented in the prompt, and an example with user input (commented out so you can choose which to keep depending on how strictly you interpret "Only use the method signatures public static void main(String[])").  The code is well-commented and explains both efficient and less-efficient approaches to the cube check.
