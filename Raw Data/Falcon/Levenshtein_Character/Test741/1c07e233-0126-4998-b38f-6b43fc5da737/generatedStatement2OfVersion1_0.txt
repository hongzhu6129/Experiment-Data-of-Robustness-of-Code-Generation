Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles negative numbers:** The `isCube` method now correctly checks for negative perfect cubes.
* **More efficient calculation:** Using `Math.cbrt()` is generally more efficient than iterating through numbers.
* **Clearer explanation:** Comments explain the logic and handle negative input.
* **Example with user input (commented out):** Shows how to get user input, but it's commented out to adhere strictly to the `public static void main(String[] args)` signature requirement.  You'd uncomment this section if you wanted to take user input dynamically.  Important: you'd need to include proper error handling (e.g., `try-catch` blocks) to handle non-integer input if you uncomment this section.
