Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles negative numbers:** The code now correctly determines if a negative number is a perfect cube.
* **Efficient cube root check:** Uses `Math.cbrt()` and rounding for a more efficient and accurate way to determine perfect cubes. This avoids the less efficient brute-force loop or the floating-point comparison issues that the previous `cbrt == (int)cbrt` approach could have.
* **Clearer comments and explanations:**  I've added more comments to explain the logic and why the chosen method is preferable.
* **Example with Scanner (commented out):**  I've included a commented-out example showing how you could take user input using the `Scanner` class. It also includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `InputMismatchException` if the user enters non-integer input.  Remember that you must close the `Scanner` when you are finished with it.
* **Strict adherence to the prompt:** Uses only `public static void main(String[] args)` as requested, and other functions are made `private`.
