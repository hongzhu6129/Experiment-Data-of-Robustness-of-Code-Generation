**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`getPentagonalNumber(int n)`:** This method efficiently calculates the nth pentagonal number using the formula `n * (3 * n - 1) / 2`.

2. **`displayPentagonalNumbers(int count)`:** 
   - This method handles the display logic.  It takes `count` as input (in this case, 50).
   - It uses a `numbersPerLine` variable to control how many numbers are printed on each line for better readability.
   - `System.out.printf("%7d", ...)` is used for formatted output. `%7d` ensures that each number takes up 7 spaces, aligning the output nicely in columns.

3. **`main` Method:** The `main` method simply calls `displayPentagonalNumbers(50)` to start the process.

4. **Clarity and Readability:** The code now includes comments to explain the purpose of each section, making it easier to understand.



This improved version is more efficient, readable, and produces well-formatted output.
