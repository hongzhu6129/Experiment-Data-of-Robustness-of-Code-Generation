**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clear Method Signatures:** The code adheres strictly to the provided method signatures: `main`, `sortedArrayToBST`, `creation`, and `traverseTree`.

2. **TreeNode Class:** A `TreeNode` inner class is defined to represent the nodes of the BST.

3. **Minimal Height:** The `creation` method recursively builds the BST. It selects the middle element of the subarray as the root at each step.  This ensures a balanced tree with minimal height because it effectively divides the array into two roughly equal halves at each level of recursion.

4. **Pre-order Traversal:** The `traverseTree` method performs a pre-order traversal of the BST to print the node values. Pre-order traversal visits the root, then the left subtree, and then the right subtree. This is a common and efficient way to explore a binary tree.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:** The code handles the edge cases of an empty or null input array correctly by returning `null`.

6. **Clarity and Readability:** Variable names are descriptive, and the code is well-commented to enhance understanding.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SortedArrayToBST.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Compile the code using the Java compiler:  `javac SortedArrayToBST.java`
3. **Run:**  Execute the compiled code: `java SortedArrayToBST`


The output will be a pre-order traversal of the constructed BST, demonstrating the conversion from the sorted array.  The exact order might vary slightly depending on the specific pre-order traversal implementation (although the tree structure will be consistent with minimal height).
