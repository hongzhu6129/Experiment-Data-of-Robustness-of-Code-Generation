Key improvements and explanations:

* **Multiple methods:** The code demonstrates three different ways to copy a LinkedList: using the copy constructor, `addAll()`, and manual iteration. The copy constructor is the simplest and usually the most efficient.
* **Clearer output:** The output clearly labels each list and shows the original and copied versions.
* **Independence Demonstration:** The code includes a demonstration showing that the copied list is independent of the original.  Modifying the copied list does *not* change the original. This is important to understand when working with collections.
* **Generics:** The code uses generics (`<Integer>`) to specify the type of elements in the linked list.  This makes the code more flexible and type-safe.  You could easily change it to `String`, `Double`, or any other object type.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the purpose of each section and the differences between the copying methods.


This improved answer is more complete, demonstrates best practices, and clarifies the concept of copying linked lists in Java.
