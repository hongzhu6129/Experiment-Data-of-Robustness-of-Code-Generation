**Explanation and Example Output:**

The `middle()` method calculates the middle index of the string.  

* **Even Length Strings:** If the string has an even length, it extracts two characters using `substring(middleIndex - 1, middleIndex + 1)`.  For instance, if the string is "java", the length is 4, `middleIndex` is 2.  The substring from index 1 (2-1) to  index 3 (exclusive, 2+1), effectively characters at index 1 and 2 ("av") are returned.

* **Odd Length Strings:**  If the string has an odd length, it extracts a single character using `substring(middleIndex, middleIndex + 1)`. For the string "hello" (length 5, `middleIndex` is 2), the substring from index 2 to index 3 (exclusive) which is character at index 2 ("l") is returned.
