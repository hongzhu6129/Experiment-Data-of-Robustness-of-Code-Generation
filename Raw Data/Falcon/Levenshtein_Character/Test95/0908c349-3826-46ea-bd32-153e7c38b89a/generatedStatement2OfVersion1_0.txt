This code directly prints the flag pattern to the console as specified in the prompt, including the "pct" on one line as shown in the example.  It uses nested loops to create the rows and columns of asterisks and equal signs.  It's a simple approach for this specific output, though less flexible than a more generalized flag-drawing program.
