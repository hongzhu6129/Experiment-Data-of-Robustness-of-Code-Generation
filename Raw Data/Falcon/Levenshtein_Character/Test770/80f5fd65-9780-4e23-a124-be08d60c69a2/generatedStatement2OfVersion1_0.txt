**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `index` instead of `i` enhances readability.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles `null` and empty input arrays. This is important for robustness.

3. **Concise Logic:** The core logic remains efficient, iterating through the array once. The condition `index < 2 || num > nums[index - 2]` ensures that we keep at most two occurrences of each element.

4. **Informative Output:** The `main` method now provides more informative output, printing both the updated length and the actual updated portion of the array using `Arrays.copyOfRange`. This helps in verifying the correctness of the `remove_Duplicates_twice` method.

5. **More Test Cases:** Added more test cases in `main` to demonstrate the behavior of the function with different inputs, including empty and null arrays.



**How it Works:**

The algorithm maintains an `index` pointing to the position where the next unique element (or allowed duplicate) should be placed. It iterates through the sorted `nums` array. If an element is encountered that is either within the first two positions (`index < 2`) or is greater than the element two positions before the current `index` (`num > nums[index - 2]`), it means we can include this element (either it's a new element or an allowed second occurrence of a duplicate).  The element is placed at `index`, and `index` is incremented.  Finally, `index` holds the length of the updated array.
