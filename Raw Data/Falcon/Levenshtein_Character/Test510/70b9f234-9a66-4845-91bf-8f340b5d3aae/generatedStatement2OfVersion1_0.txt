**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clear Node Class:** A separate `Node` class encapsulates the structure of a tree node, making the code more organized.

2. **Recursive `maxDepth` Method:** This method efficiently calculates the maximum depth using recursion:
   - **Base Case:** If the node is `null` (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
   - **Recursive Step:**  Recursively calculate the depth of the left and right subtrees. The maximum depth of the current node is the maximum of the left and right subtree depths, plus 1 (for the current node itself).

3. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** The `main` method includes several test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the `maxDepth` method:
   - A basic tree example.
   - A slightly different tree to show handling of both left and right subtrees.
   - A test case for an empty tree (important edge case).

4. **Clear Output:**  The `println` statements clearly label the output, making it easy to understand the results of the tests.


This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and handles different tree structures correctly.
