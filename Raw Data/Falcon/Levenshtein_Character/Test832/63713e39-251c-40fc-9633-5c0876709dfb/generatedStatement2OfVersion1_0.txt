This code will correctly calculate and display the first few Fermat numbers. However,  Fermat numbers grow incredibly large very quickly.  `long` variables in Java can only store numbers up to 2^63 - 1.  This means that after the 5th Fermat Number (65537), the calculations will overflow, and the results will be incorrect.  

To handle arbitrarily large numbers, you would need to use `BigInteger` which we cannot do within the restriction of only using `public static void main(String[] args)`.


If you must stay within the confines of only a main method, you'll be limited to the first five correct Fermat numbers due to the `long` data type's limitations.  If precision beyond the 5th Fermat number is required, the `BigInteger` class is essential, but using that would require helper functions outside of `main`.
