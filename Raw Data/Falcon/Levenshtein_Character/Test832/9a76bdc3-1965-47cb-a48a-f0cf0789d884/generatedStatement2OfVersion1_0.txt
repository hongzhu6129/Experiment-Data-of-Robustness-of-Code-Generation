**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Explicit Type Casting:** The `Math.pow()` method returns a `double`.  Fermat numbers can quickly become very large, exceeding the capacity of `int`.  Therefore, we cast the result to `long` to handle larger values.  However, even `long` has its limits, and for larger values of `n`, the Fermat number will overflow.

2. **BigInteger (For truly large Fermat Numbers):**  If you need to calculate Fermat numbers beyond what `long` can handle, use `BigInteger` from the `java.math` package:
