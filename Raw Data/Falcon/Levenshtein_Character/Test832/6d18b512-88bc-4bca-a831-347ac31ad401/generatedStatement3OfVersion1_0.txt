This `BigInteger` version will provide accurate results for all the first 10 Fermat numbers, even the extremely large ones that would overflow `long`.


3. **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is well-formatted and easy to understand.  Comments are included to explain the logic.



This revised explanation provides both a simple solution using `long` (with limitations) and a more robust and accurate solution using `BigInteger` for handling very large Fermat numbers.
