Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:**  It uses a `try-catch` block to handle `DateTimeParseException`.  This prevents the program from crashing if the user enters an invalid date format.  It provides a user-friendly error message.
* **Clear Prompts:** The code tells the user exactly what format to enter their birthdate in.
* **Standard Date/Time API:**  It uses `java.time` (introduced in Java 8), which is the preferred way to work with dates and times in modern Java. It's much better than the old `Date` and `Calendar` classes.
* **Concise Output:** The output clearly presents the age in years, months, and days.


How to run this code:

1. Save it as `CalculateAge.java`.
2. Compile: `javac CalculateAge.java`
3. Run: `java CalculateAge`


The program will then prompt you to enter your birthdate.
