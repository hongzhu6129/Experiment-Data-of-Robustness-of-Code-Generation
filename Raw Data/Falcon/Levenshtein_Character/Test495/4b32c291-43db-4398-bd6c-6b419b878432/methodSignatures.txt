 Only use the method signatures public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the problem description: write a Java program to print the first 15 numbers of the pell series. in mathematics, the pell numbers are an infinite sequence of integers. the sequence of pell numbers starts with 0 and 1, and then each pell number is the sum of twice the previous pell number and on pell number before that.: thus, 70 is the companion to 29, and 70 = 2 � 29 + 12 = 58 + 12.
The programming language is Java.
