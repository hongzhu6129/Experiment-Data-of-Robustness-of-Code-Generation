Write a Java program to print the first 15 numbers of the Pell series. In mathematics, the Pell numbers are an infinite sequence of integers. The sequence of Pell numbers starts with 0 and 1, and then each Pell number is the sum of twice the previous Pell number and the Pell number before that.: thus, 70 is the companion to 29, and 70 = 2 × 29 + 12 = 58 + 12.
