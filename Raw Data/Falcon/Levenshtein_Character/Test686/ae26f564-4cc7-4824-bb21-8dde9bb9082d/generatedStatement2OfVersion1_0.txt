Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Demonstration of "Invalid" Dates:**  The code now explicitly sets an invalid date (February 30th) and shows how Java's `Calendar` and `Date` classes handle it by adjusting the date to the next valid date (March 1st in a leap year or March 2nd in a non-leap year).

2. **Valid Date Example:** A valid date example is included for contrast.

3. **Robust Date Existence Check:** The most important addition is a more robust way to check if a date *actually exists* within a given year and month, taking into account leap years and different month lengths.  This is the most practical approach if your goal is to determine whether a user-provided date or any calculated date is valid before using it.

4. **Clearer Output:**  The output is formatted to be more informative.

5. **Comments and Explanations:**  The code includes detailed comments explaining each step.



How to run the code:

1. Save the code as `CheckDateExists.java`.
2. Compile it: `javac CheckDateExists.java`
3. Run it:  `java CheckDateExists`
