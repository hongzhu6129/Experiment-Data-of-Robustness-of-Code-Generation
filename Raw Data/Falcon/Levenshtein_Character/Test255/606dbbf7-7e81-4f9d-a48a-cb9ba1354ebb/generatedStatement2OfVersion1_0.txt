Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Method Signature Adherence:** The code strictly adheres to the requested `main` and `Saddleback` method signatures.
* **Returns an Array:**  The `Saddleback` method returns an `int[]` containing the row and column indices (or {-1, -1} if not found). This is a standard and efficient way to return multiple values from a method in Java.
* **Handles Not Found Case:** The code now correctly handles the case where the target element is not present in the array.
* **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to call the `Saddleback` method and interpret the results.  It also shows how to handle the "not found" scenario.
* **Comments and Readability:**  Comments and more descriptive variable names improve code readability.
* **More robust testing**: The `main` method tests with both a target that IS present and a target that is NOT present in the array to demonstrate proper functionality.


This improved version is much more robust, easier to understand, and correctly implements the saddleback search algorithm while meeting the specified method signature requirements.
