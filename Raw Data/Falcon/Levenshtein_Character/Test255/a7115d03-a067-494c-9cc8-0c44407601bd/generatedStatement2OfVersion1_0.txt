Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `m` and `n` for rows and columns is standard and improves readability.

2. **Return an `int[]`:** The `Saddleback` function returns an `int[]` array of size 2 to store the row and column index of the target.  This is much cleaner than printing directly from within the search function.  If the target isn't found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.

3. **Concise Search Logic:** The `while` loop condition and the `if-else if-else` structure within it implement the saddleback search efficiently.  The comments explain the logic of moving down or left based on the comparison with the target.

4. **Error Handling:**  The `main` method checks the returned array from `Saddleback` to determine if the target was found and prints an appropriate message.

5. **Example Usage:**  The `main` method provides a sample matrix and target to demonstrate how to use the `Saddleback` function.

6. **Adherence to Method Signatures:** The code strictly uses the provided `main` and `Saddleback` method signatures.


This improved code is more robust, easier to understand, and follows best practices for function design and error handling.
