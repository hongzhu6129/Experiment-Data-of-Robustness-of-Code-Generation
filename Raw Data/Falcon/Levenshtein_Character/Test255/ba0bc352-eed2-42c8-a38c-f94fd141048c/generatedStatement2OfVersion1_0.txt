Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:**  `m` and `n` are more descriptive than the original single-letter variables.

2. **Return an Array for Coordinates:**  The `Saddleback` function now returns an `int[]` containing the row and column index. This is a more standard and convenient way to return multiple values.  If the target is not found, it returns `{-1, -1}`.

3. **Concise Conditionals:**  The `if/else if/else` structure inside the `while` loop makes the logic easier to follow.

4. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the core logic and the purpose of returning `{-1, -1}`.

5. **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates how to call `Saddleback` and interpret the results. It also includes an example with a target that's *not* present in the matrix.

6. **Error Handling (Target Not Found):** Returns {-1, -1} to signal when the target is not found.  The main method now checks for this.


This improved version is more robust, readable, and efficient, adhering to best practices for Java code.
