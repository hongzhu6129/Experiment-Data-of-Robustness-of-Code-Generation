Explanation:

1. **`main` Method:**
   - The `main` method is the entry point of the program.
   - It sets example values for the investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years.
   - It calls the `futureInvestmentValue` method to calculate the future value.
   - It prints the result to the console.  I've added a second example call to demonstrate usage with different values.

2. **`futureInvestmentValue` Method:**
   - Takes `investmentAmount`, `annualInterestRate`, and `numberOfYears` as input.
   - Calculates the monthly interest rate by dividing the annual rate by 1200 (12 months and 100 for percentage conversion).
   - Calculates the number of months by multiplying the number of years by 12.
   - Uses the future value formula: `futureValue = investmentAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^numberOfMonths`. The `Math.pow()` method is used for exponentiation.
   - Returns the calculated future value.


Key improvements:

- Clearer variable names (e.g., `annualInterestRate` instead of just `rate`).
- Comments explaining the calculations.
- Example usage in the `main` method.
- Conversion of annual interest rate to monthly interest rate within the method.
- Direct use of the future value formula, making the code more concise and understandable.
- More robust handling of interest rate input (percentage).
