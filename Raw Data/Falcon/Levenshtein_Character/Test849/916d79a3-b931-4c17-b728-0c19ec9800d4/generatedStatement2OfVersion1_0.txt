Key improvements and explanations:

* **Test Cases:**  The provided code includes a comprehensive set of JUnit 5 test cases.  These tests cover:
    * **Positive Radius:**  The original example (radius 7.5).
    * **Zero Radius:**  A boundary case.
    * **Negative Radius:**  An invalid input; the tests check for an `IllegalArgumentException` (which you should add to the `calculatePerimeter` and `calculateArea` methods if you want truly robust code).
    * **Very Large Radius:** Handling potential overflow with `Double.MAX_VALUE`.
    * **Very Small Radius:**  Handling potential underflow and precision issues.
* **JUnit 5:**  Using JUnit 5 provides a standard and robust way to write tests.  The `@Test` annotation marks test methods. Assertions like `assertEquals` verify the expected output.
* **Delta for Floating-Point Comparisons:** When comparing floating-point numbers, you should almost never use exact equality (`==`).  Floating-point calculations have inherent limitations in precision. The `assertEquals` method with a third `delta` argument allows for a small tolerance in the comparison.
