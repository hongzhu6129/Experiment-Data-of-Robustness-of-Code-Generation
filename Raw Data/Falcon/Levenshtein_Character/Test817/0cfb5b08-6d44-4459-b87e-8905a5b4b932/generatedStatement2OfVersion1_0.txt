Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Distinct Pairs:**  The inner loops start from `a+1` and `c+1` respectively to ensure that (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct pairs and also avoid duplicates (e.g., 1^3 + 12^3 and 12^3 + 1^3 would be considered the same without this change).

2. **Optimizations:** The `break` statements within the loops significantly improve efficiency.  They prevent unnecessary calculations when the sum of cubes already exceeds `n`.

3. **Clarity and Readability:** Comments have been added to make the code easier to understand.

4. **Correctness:** The code now accurately finds a number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two *different* ways, as per the problem specification.

5. **Flexibility:**  You can easily remove the `return;` statement if you want the program to print *all* such numbers between 1 and `n` instead of just the first one.


This revised code is more efficient, correct, and adheres more closely to the original intent of the Ramanujan number problem.
