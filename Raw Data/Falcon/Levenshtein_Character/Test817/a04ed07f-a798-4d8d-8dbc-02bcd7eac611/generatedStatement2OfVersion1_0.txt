Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Readability:**  Variable names are more descriptive (e.g., `a3` instead of just `a`).
2. **Efficiency:**  
   - Added `break` statements inside the loops to avoid unnecessary calculations when a cube or a sum exceeds the target `n`. This significantly improves performance.
   - Starts the `b` loop from `a + 1` to prevent duplicate pairs (e.g., 1^3 + 2^3 is the same as 2^3 + 1^3).
   - Starts the `d` loop from `c + 1` for the same reason.
3. **Correctness:**
   - The condition `(c != a || d != b)` ensures that we are finding *different* pairs of cubes that sum to the same value.  This was a crucial missing piece in earlier versions.
4. **Handles No Solution:**  The code now prints a message if no Ramanujan number is found within the given range.
5. **Clear Output:** The output is formatted to clearly show the Ramanujan number and the two ways it can be expressed as the sum of two cubes.


This improved version provides a more efficient, correct, and understandable solution to the Ramanujan number problem.  It's designed to be easier to follow and learn from.
