Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic and purpose of each code section.  Good comments make the code easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Efficiency:** The inner loop starts from `b = a`. This avoids redundant calculations (since a� + b� is the same as b� + a�) and improves efficiency.

3. **Output Formatting:** Improved the output to clearly show the Ramanujan number and the different ways it can be expressed as a sum of two cubes.

4. **Handling No Results:**  Added a message to indicate if no Ramanujan numbers are found within the specified range.


This improved version is more efficient, readable, and provides more informative output. It also addresses the original problem statement more directly by printing the *smallest* such number.  It also handles the edge case where no such number exists within the range.
