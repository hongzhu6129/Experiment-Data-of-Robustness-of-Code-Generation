Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Distinct Pairs Check**: The code now explicitly checks for distinct pairs (a, b) and (c, d)  to ensure they are not the same or just swapped.  It also makes sure we don't print duplicate results when multiple distinct pairs sum to the same taxicab number.

2. **Efficiency Improvements**: Added `break` statements inside loops to optimize the execution. If `a^3`, `a^3 + b^3`, or `c^3` exceeds `n`, there's no need to continue checking within those loops. This significantly reduces unnecessary calculations.

3. **Clearer Output:**  The output now displays the number as the sum of cubes in the desired format (e.g., 1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3).

4. **Early Exit:** The `return` statement after printing the first found "taxicab number" stops the program, fulfilling the requirement to find *any* such number. If you want to find all such numbers up to `n`, remove the `return` statement.

5. **Correctness**: Handles edge cases and duplicate issues more robustly to ensure accurate results.




This revised code efficiently addresses the problem and produces the correct output while avoiding unnecessary computations.
