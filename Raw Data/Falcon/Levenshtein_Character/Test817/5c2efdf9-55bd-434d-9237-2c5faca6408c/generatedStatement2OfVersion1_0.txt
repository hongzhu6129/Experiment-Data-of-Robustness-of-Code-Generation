Key improvements and explanations:

* **Optimizations:** Several `break` statements are added to exit loops early when it's clear that continuing won't yield any further solutions. This significantly improves performance.
* **Distinct Pairs:**  The code now correctly handles distinct pairs. The inner loops for `b` and `d` iterate up to `a` and `c` respectively (exclusive) to avoid counting (a, b) and (b, a) or (c,d) and (d,c) as separate solutions.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Variable names are more descriptive (e.g., `a3` for a cubed), and comments explain the logic.
* **Correct Output:** The output now prints the number only when it's found to be expressible as the sum of two cubes in *at least two different ways*, as the problem specifies. It also correctly displays the different cube pairs.


This revised code is much more efficient and accurately solves the problem of finding taxicab numbers within a given range.
