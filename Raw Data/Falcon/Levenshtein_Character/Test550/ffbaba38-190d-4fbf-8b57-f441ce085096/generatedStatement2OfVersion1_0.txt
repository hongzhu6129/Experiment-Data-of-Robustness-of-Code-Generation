Key improvements and explanations:

1. **LocalDateTime vs. ZonedDateTime:**
   - `LocalDateTime` is used for date and time without time zone information.
   - `ZonedDateTime` is used when time zone is important (as it is for several of your required formats).  We use `ZonedDateTime.now()` to get the current date and time in the system's default time zone.

2. **DateTimeFormatter:** The `DateTimeFormatter` class is the core of formatting dates and times in modern Java.  We create formatters using `DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern()` and pass the desired format string.

3. **Format Pattern Symbols:** The format pattern symbols (e.g., `yyyy`, `MM`, `dd`, `HH`, `mm`, `ss`, `z`, `Z`, `SSS`) are case-sensitive and follow the Java `DateTimeFormatter` specifications.  The code now uses the correct uppercase and lowercase symbols.

4. **Zone and Offset:**  The code now demonstrates both `z` (general time zone abbreviation) and `Z` (time zone offset like +05:30 or -0800).

5. **Error Handling (Optional but Recommended):** In a real-world application, you might want to add `try-catch` blocks to handle potential `DateTimeParseException` if an invalid format string is used.


This revised code accurately produces all the requested date and time formats, using best practices for modern Java date/time handling.
