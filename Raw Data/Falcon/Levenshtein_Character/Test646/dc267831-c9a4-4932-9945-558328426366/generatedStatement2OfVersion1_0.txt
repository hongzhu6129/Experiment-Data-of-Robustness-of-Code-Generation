Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles `null` and empty input arrays, preventing potential `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. **Clearer Variable Naming:**  `uniqueCount` is a more descriptive name than `j`, clearly indicating its purpose.

3. **In-Place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` function modifies the input array `nums` in place. This is standard practice for this type of problem. The unique elements are placed at the beginning of the array.

4. **Return Value:** The function returns the length of the new subarray containing only the unique elements. This is crucial information for the caller.

5. **Main Method with Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `removeDuplicates` function with various example input arrays (including edge cases), making it easier to understand and test.

6. **Printing the Modified Array:** The `main` method now uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to print only the relevant portion of the modified array (up to the `uniqueCount`), providing a more accurate representation of the result.  This avoids printing the remaining "garbage" values that are still present in the original array after the unique elements.



This improved version is more robust, efficient, and easier to understand. It also adheres to the problem's requirements of using only the specified method signatures.
