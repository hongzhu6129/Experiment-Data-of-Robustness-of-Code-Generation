Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles year1 > year2:**  The code now correctly calculates the difference even if `year1` is greater than `year2`. It does this by iterating from the smaller year to the larger and then negating the result if `year1 > year2` to indicate the direction of the difference.
2. **Clearer Prompting:**  Uses `System.out.print` for prompts to make it clearer what input is expected.
3. **Scanner Closure:**  The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` to release resources.
4. **Concise Calculation:** The `number_of_days` method is more concise using the ternary operator.
5. **Correct Leap Year Logic:** The `is_Leap_Year` method implements the correct leap year rules.


How to compile and run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DaysBetweenYears.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:  `javac DaysBetweenYears.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code with: `java DaysBetweenYears`


The program will then prompt you to enter the two years.
