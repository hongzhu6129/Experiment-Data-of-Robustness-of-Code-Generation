3. **Character Encoding Test (Less Critical):** Ensure the output is displayed correctly with different character encodings (UTF-8, ASCII, etc.).  This is generally handled by the system, but can be relevant in some environments.  You might set your system's locale or use a specific output encoding if needed when redirecting to a file.


**Corner Cases (Not Applicable in the Strictest Sense):**

This program doesn't have true corner cases because there are no inputs to manipulate. Corner cases usually involve boundary conditions, invalid inputs, or extreme values.  However, we can consider a "quasi-corner case":

1. **Empty String in `println()`:**  While not a true corner case, you could modify the code to handle a potentially empty string by checking for it before printing. This is defensive programming, but not strictly necessary in this very simple example.
