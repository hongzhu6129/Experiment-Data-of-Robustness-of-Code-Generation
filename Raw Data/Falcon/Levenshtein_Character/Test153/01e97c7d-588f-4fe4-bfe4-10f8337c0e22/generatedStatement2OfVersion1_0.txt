**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code now includes handling for `null` input arrays and demonstrates behavior with empty, all-even, and all-odd arrays.

2. **In-Place Partitioning (Optional, Requires Different Signature):**  If you can change the method signature to  `public static void partitionArray(int[] arr)`, you can perform the partitioning in-place (without creating a new array) using a two-pointer approach. This would be more memory-efficient. Example:
