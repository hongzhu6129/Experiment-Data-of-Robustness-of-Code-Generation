Write a Java program to print out the first 10 Catalan numbers by extracting them from Pascal's triangle. In combinatorial mathematics, the Catalan numbers form a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursively-defined objects. They are named after the Belgian mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan.
