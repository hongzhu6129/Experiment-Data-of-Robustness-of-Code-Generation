Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  It now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` makes the code easier to follow.
- **Comprehensive testing in `main`:** Demonstrates the function's behavior with various inputs, including those with no duplicates, duplicates at the beginning, and empty/null arrays.
- **Output formatting:**  The output now clearly shows both the updated length and the contents of the updated portion of the array using `Arrays.copyOfRange()` to avoid displaying the unchanged elements beyond the new length.


This revised response addresses the prompt's requirements and demonstrates best practices for robust and well-documented code.
