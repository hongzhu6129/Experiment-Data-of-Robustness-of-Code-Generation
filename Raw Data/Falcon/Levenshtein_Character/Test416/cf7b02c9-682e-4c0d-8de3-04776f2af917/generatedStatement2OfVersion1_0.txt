Key improvements in this version:

* **Error Handling:** Uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `DateTimeParseException` if the user enters an invalid date format.  This makes the code more robust.
* **Clearer Prompts and Output:**  Provides more user-friendly prompts and output messages.
* **Efficiency:**  Calculates the next date with the same day of the week efficiently using the modulo operator (`%`).  This avoids unnecessary looping.  It also correctly handles cases where the input date's day of the week is the same as today's.
* **Standard Date Formatting:** Uses `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE` for consistent and unambiguous date formatting.
