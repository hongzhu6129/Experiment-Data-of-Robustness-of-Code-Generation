Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:** Comments explain the logic of the Sieve of Eratosthenes clearly. The code is formatted consistently for better readability.
* **Efficiency:** The outer loop only iterates up to the square root of `n` (`p * p <= n`), which is a standard optimization for the Sieve.
* **Correctness:** Handles edge cases correctly (e.g., when `n` is small).
* **Returns an Array:** The `generatePrimes` function now returns an integer array containing the prime numbers found, making it more reusable.
* **Multiple Examples in `main`:** Demonstrates the usage with different input values.
* **Added Newlines:**  Prints a newline at the end of the output for better formatting.
