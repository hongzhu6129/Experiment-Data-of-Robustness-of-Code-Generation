```java

public class ArithmeticOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        double num1 = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");

**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | Sum: 15.0<br>Difference: 5.0<br>Product: 50.0<br>Quotient: 2.0<br>Remainder: 0.0 |
| Negative Numbers | -10 | -5 | Sum: -15.0<br>Difference: -5.0<br>Product: 50.0<br>Quotient: 2.0<br>Remainder: 0.0 |
| Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | Sum: 5.0<br>Difference: 15.0<br>Product: -50.0<br>Quotient: -2.0<br>Remainder: 0.0 |
| Zero as num2 (Division by Zero) | 10 | 0 | Sum: 10.0<br>Difference: 10.0<br>Product: 0.0<br>Division by zero is not allowed.<br>Remainder with zero divisor is not allowed. |
| Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | Sum: 5.0<br>Difference: -5.0<br>Product: 0.0<br>Quotient: 0.0<br>Remainder: 0.0 |
| Both Zero | 0 | 0 | Sum: 0.0<br>Difference: 0.0<br>Product: 0.0<br>Division by zero is not allowed.<br>Remainder with zero divisor is not allowed. |
| Large Numbers | 100000 | 5000 | Sum: 105000.0<br>Difference: 95000.0<br>Product: 5.0E8<br>Quotient: 20.0<br>Remainder: 0.0 |
| Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | Sum: 13.0<br>Difference: 8.0<br>Product: 26.25<br>Quotient: 4.2<br>Remainder: 0.0 |



**How to Run Test Cases:**

You can manually test these cases by running the program and entering the input values.  For more automated testing, you could use JUnit (a Java testing framework).


**Key Improvements in this Code:**

* **Handles Division by Zero:**  The code now explicitly checks for division by zero and prints an appropriate message, preventing runtime errors.
* **Uses `double` for More Precision:** Using `double` instead of `int` allows the program to handle decimal numbers correctly.
* **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted to clearly label each operation's result.
* **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `input.close()` to release the resource.  This is good practice, especially in larger programs.



This improved version is more robust and provides a better user experience.
