Remember to add the JUnit dependency to your project if you are using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse.  This allows for automated testing and easier verification of your code's correctness.  You'll need to modify your `ArithmeticOperations` class slightly to make the methods (add, subtract, etc.) `static` and `public` so JUnit can access them directly without creating an instance of the class. This is standard practice for unit testing.
