Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clarity and Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic, making the code more understandable.
2. **ASCII Assumption:** The `count` array is initialized to 256, explicitly stating the assumption of ASCII characters.
3. **Error Handling (Optional):**  While the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention handling edge cases, for robust code, you might consider adding checks for null or empty strings, or strings with non-ASCII characters.
4. **Multiple Test Cases in `main`:** Added multiple test cases in the `main` method to demonstrate the code's functionality with different input strings.
5. **Efficiency:** The code is reasonably efficient. The time complexity is dominated by the factorial calculation, which is O(n). The rest of the calculation within `calcuLexicoRank` is O(n) as well (due to the loops), so the overall complexity is still O(n).  However, note that factorials can grow very large quickly, so for very long strings, you might encounter integer overflow issues (depending on the range of input strings expected).  If you anticipate very large strings, consider using `BigInteger` for factorial calculations.
