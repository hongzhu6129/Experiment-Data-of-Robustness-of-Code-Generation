Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Character Counting Array:** The `count` array is used to store the count of characters smaller than the current character.  It's initialized to size 256 to handle all ASCII characters.  This makes the code more robust compared to solutions assuming only a limited alphabet.

2. **Factorial Calculation:** The `makefactorial` method efficiently calculates factorials.

3. **Lexicographic Rank Calculation:** The core logic is in `calcuLexicoRank`. It iterates through the string:
   - Calculates the number of smaller characters using the `count` array.
   - Multiplies this count by the factorial of the remaining characters (using `mul`). This contributes to the rank.
   - Updates the `count` array to exclude the current character for subsequent iterations.

4. **Clarity and Comments:**  The code now has comments explaining the key steps, improving readability.

5. **Main Method with Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `calcuLexicoRank` function with a couple of example strings.

6. **Error Handling (Optional):** While not strictly required by the prompt, you could add input validation in `calcuLexicoRank` to handle null or empty strings, or strings with non-ASCII characters, depending on the specific requirements.


How to Compile and Run:

1. Save the code as `LexicographicRank.java`.
2. Compile: `javac LexicographicRank.java`
3. Run: `java LexicographicRank`


This improved version addresses the potential issues and is more efficient and readable than the initial example.
