Key improvements in this version:

- **Clearer Method Names:** `count_nums_not_7` is still used as required, but the helper function is named `containsDigit7` which is more descriptive.
- **Helper Function:**  The logic for checking if a number contains 7 is separated into `containsDigit7`, making the main function cleaner and easier to understand.
- **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the purpose of each method and section of the code.
- **Example Usage in `main`:** The `main` method now demonstrates how to use the `count_nums_not_7` function with a few example inputs. This makes it easier to test and understand the code's functionality.
- **Efficiency:** While a more mathematically sophisticated approach could be slightly faster for very large `n`, this iterative method is clear, correct, and efficient enough for most practical purposes.  The complexity is O(n log n) as each number checked is at most log n digits long.
