Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Interval Class:**  An `Interval` class is created to encapsulate the start and end of an interval. This makes the code more organized and readable.

2. **Comparator for Sorting:** The `Collections.sort()` method along with a custom `Comparator` is used to sort the intervals based on their start times. This is crucial for the merging logic to work correctly.

3. **Merging Logic:** The core merging logic is implemented efficiently. It iterates through the sorted intervals and compares the end of the current interval with the start of the next interval.  If they overlap (next start <= current end), a new merged interval is created. Otherwise, the current interval is added to the result, and the next interval becomes the current one.

4. **Handling the Last Interval:**  The code now correctly adds the last processed interval to the `mergedIntervals` list after the loop finishes. This was a common source of errors in previous versions.

5. **Clearer Output:** The output now prints the merged intervals in the desired format "start end start end ...".


This revised solution addresses the original issues and provides a more robust and efficient solution for merging overlapping intervals. It adheres to the given method signature requirements.
