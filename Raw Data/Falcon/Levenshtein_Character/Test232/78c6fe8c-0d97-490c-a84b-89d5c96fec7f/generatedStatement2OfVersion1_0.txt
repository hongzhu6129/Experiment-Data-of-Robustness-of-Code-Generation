Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Clarity and Readability:**  The code now uses `boolean` for the 2D array `a`, which is more appropriate for representing true/false values.  The output is also formatted more clearly with spaces between the "true" and "false" values and a newline at the end of the output.

2. **Efficiency in `isPrime()`:** The `isPrime` function is now more efficient.  It correctly handles the base cases (0 and 1 are not prime) and only iterates up to the square root of `n`, which is sufficient for primality testing.

3. **`prime_cell()` Returns an Integer:** The `prime_cell` method returns an integer (1 for true, 0 for false) to adhere to the required signature. The main method then converts this integer to a boolean value.

4. **Example in `main()`:**  The `main` method now demonstrates how to use `prime_cell()` and creates a sample 3x3 array.  You can easily adjust `m` to change the array dimensions.



Example Output (for `m=3`):
