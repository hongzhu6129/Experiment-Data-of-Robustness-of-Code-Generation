Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clarity and Comments:** Added comments to explain what each `Calendar` field represents and the output.  The important note about `Calendar.MONTH` being zero-indexed is emphasized.
* **`getMaximum()` vs. `getActualMaximum()`:**  Explained the difference and showed how to use `getActualMaximum()` to find the maximum day of the month for a *specific* month and year.
* **`Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK` Clarification:**  Clearly stated that `DAY_OF_WEEK` is 1-indexed (Sunday=1, Saturday=7).
* **Example for specific month/year:**  Included an example showing how to set the calendar to a particular month and year to get the maximum days for that month.
* **`Calendar.YEAR` explanation**: Added clarification regarding the very large return value.


This revised version is more educational and provides a better understanding of how to work with `Calendar`'s maximum values in Java.
