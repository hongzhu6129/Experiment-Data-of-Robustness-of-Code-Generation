This code addresses the error "invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'buzz. '" by demonstrating the following:

1. **Reproducing the Error:** It attempts to parse the string "buzz" into an integer using `Integer.parseInt()`, which will throw a `NumberFormatException`.

2. **Handling the Error:** It uses a `try-catch` block to catch the `NumberFormatException`.  Inside the `catch` block, it prints an informative error message.  This prevents the program from crashing and allows you to handle the error gracefully.

3. **Correct Parsing:**  It shows an example of successfully parsing a valid integer string ("123").

4. **Handling Whitespace:** It demonstrates how to handle strings that might have leading or trailing whitespace using the `trim()` method. This is a common source of `NumberFormatException` errors.


This comprehensive example illustrates how to avoid and handle the "invalid literal for int()" error in Java when working with string-to-integer conversions.
