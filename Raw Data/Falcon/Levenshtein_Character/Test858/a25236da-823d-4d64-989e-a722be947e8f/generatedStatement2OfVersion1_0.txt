Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code now explicitly handles `null` and empty input arrays. This makes the function more robust.

2. **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueIndex` replaces `j` for better readability, making the code's purpose easier to understand.

3. **Concise Return:** The function directly returns `uniqueIndex + 1`, which is simpler and more efficient than creating a new array (as in the previous versions).

4. **In-Place Modification:** The function modifies the input array `nums` directly (in-place), which is the standard and expected behavior for this problem.  The original elements beyond the unique part are still present in the `nums` array, but we only consider the relevant part (up to `uniqueIndex`).

5. **Comprehensive `main` method:** The `main` method now includes tests with different input arrays (including empty, null, and single-element arrays) to demonstrate the code's correctness in various scenarios. Using `Arrays.copyOfRange` in the print statements is crucial to avoid displaying the unmodified parts of the array after the unique elements.
