Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` input, returning 0 as expected.

2. **Clearer Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` replaces `j` to make the code more readable and self-explanatory.

3. **Concise Logic:** The code uses a single `for` loop to efficiently iterate and update the array in-place.

4. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method now includes more test cases to cover various scenarios, including empty, null, and arrays with no duplicates.

5. **Output Formatting:**  The output in `main` now clearly displays the updated length and the relevant portion of the modified array using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid showing the unchanged elements beyond `len`. This makes the results easier to interpret.



This improved version addresses the original prompt's requirements while also being more robust and easier to understand.
