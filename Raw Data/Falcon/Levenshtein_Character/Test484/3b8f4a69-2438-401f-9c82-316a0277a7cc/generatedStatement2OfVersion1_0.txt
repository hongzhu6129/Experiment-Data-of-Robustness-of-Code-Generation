**Test cases:**

* **Valid case:**
    * Input: minor = 10, k = 2
    * Output: The value of each equal part is: 5
* **Invalid minor case:**
    * Input: minor = -10, k = 2
    * Output: Invalid minor
* **Invalid number of equal parts case:**
    * Input: minor = 10, k = 0
    * Output: Invalid number of equal parts
* **Minor not divisible by the number of equal parts case:**
    * Input: minor = 11, k = 2
    * Output: The minor is not divisible by the number of equal parts
* **Corner case:**
    * Input: minor = 1, k = 1
    * Output: The value of each equal part is: 1
