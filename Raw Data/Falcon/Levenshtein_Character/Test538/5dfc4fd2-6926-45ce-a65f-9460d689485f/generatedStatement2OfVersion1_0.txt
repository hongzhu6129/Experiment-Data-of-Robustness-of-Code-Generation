Key Improvements and explanations:

* **JUnit Tests:** The code now includes JUnit tests (`RectangleTest` class). JUnit is a standard Java testing framework, making testing much more organized and automated. 
* **Corner Cases:** The tests cover several corner cases:
    * Zero length and zero width.
    * Very small length and width values.
    * Large values.
    * A square (where length equals width).
* **Clearer Output in `main`:** The `main` method now prints the results more clearly, indicating which rectangle each output corresponds to.
* **Handling Negative Input (Optional but Recommended):** Although not explicitly requested, I've added a test case (`negativeInput_throwsIllegalArgumentException`) that checks for negative length or width. It's generally a good practice to handle invalid input. You could modify the `Rectangle` constructor to explicitly throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if negative values are provided, as shown in the test case.



How to Run the Tests:

1. **IDE:** If you are using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you can directly run the tests from within the IDE. Right-click on the `RectangleTest` class and select "Run 'RectangleTest'".
2. **Command Line (with JUnit on the Classpath):** You can compile and run from the command line:
