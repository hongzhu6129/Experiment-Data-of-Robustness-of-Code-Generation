Key improvements and explanations:

* **Test Cases:**  The code now includes a comprehensive suite of JUnit 5 test cases to cover normal cases, corner cases (zero dimensions, negative dimensions), and potentially problematic cases (large numbers, decimal values).  This ensures that the `Rectangle` class functions correctly under various conditions.
* **Exception Handling (Improved):** Instead of printing error messages, the updated code throws `IllegalArgumentException` if the user tries to create a rectangle with negative or zero length/width. This is standard practice for handling invalid input and makes the code more robust. You can customize how these exceptions are handled at a higher level in your application.  We use `assertThrows` in the tests to verify this behavior.
* **Clearer Separation:**  The `main` method is now solely for demonstration. The actual testing logic is separated into the `RectangleTest` class, making the code cleaner and more organized.
* **More Descriptive Test Names:**  Test names are more descriptive, clearly indicating what each test is checking.
* **Decimal Values Test:** Added a test case to specifically handle decimal values for length and width.

How to run the tests:

1. **IDE:**  If you are using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you can directly run the tests from within the IDE.  It will typically have built-in support for JUnit.
2. **Command Line (with build tool like Maven or Gradle):** The most common way to run JUnit tests is using a build automation tool.  If your project uses Maven, you would typically run `mvn test`.  For Gradle, it would be `./gradlew test`.


This improved version is more robust, testable, and adheres better to software development best practices.
