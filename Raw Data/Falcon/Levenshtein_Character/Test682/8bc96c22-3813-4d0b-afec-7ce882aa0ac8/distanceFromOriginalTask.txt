nullInput Sentence 1:  \nWrite a Java program to find a specified element in a given sorted array of elements using Exponential search.\nFrom Wikipedia, in computer science, an exponential search (also called doubling search or galloping search or Struzik search) is an algorithm, created by Jon Bentley and Andrew Chi-Chih Yao in 1976, for searching sorted, unbounded/infinite lists. There are numerous ways to implement this with the most common being to determine a range that the search key resides in and performing a binary search within that range. This takes O(log i) where i is the position of the search key in the list, if the search key is in the list, or the position where the search key should be, if the search key is not in the list. Input Sentence 2: 25. write a Java program to find a specified element in a given sorted array of elements using exponential search. from wikipedia, in computer science, an probability search (also called doubling search or galloping search or struzik search) is an algorithm, created by jon bentley and andrew chi-chih yao in 1976, for searching sorted, unbounded/infinite lists. there are numerous ways to implement this with the most common being to determine a range that the search key resides in and performing a binary search within that range. this takes o(log i) where i is the position of the search key in the list, if the search key is in the list, or the position where the search key should be, if the search key is not in the list.Cosine Similarity: 0.9994Euclidean Distance: 0.1675
