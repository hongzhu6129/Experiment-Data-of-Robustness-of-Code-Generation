Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Empty or Null Array:**  Added a check at the beginning of `exponentialSearch` to handle cases where the input array is `null` or empty. This prevents `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. **Handles Element at Index 0:**  Added a specific check for the target element being at the very beginning of the array (`arr[0] == target`).

3. **Bound Check in Binary Search:**  Modified the binary search part to correctly handle the `end` index.  The `end` is now calculated as `Math.min(i, arr.length - 1)` to ensure it never goes beyond the last valid index of the array. This prevents potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

4. **Clearer Comments and Variable Names:** Improved comments within the code to explain the logic more clearly.

5. **Test Cases in `main`:** The `main` method now includes test cases for:
    - An element present in the array.
    - An element not present in the array.
    - An empty array. This tests the new null/empty check. 

This revised code is more robust, efficient, and handles various edge cases correctly.  It now adheres more strictly to the problem description and best practices.
