This code measures the execution time of a simple loop that calculates the sum of numbers from 0 to 999,999.  You can replace the code inside the timed section with any other code you want to measure.

Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Names:** `startTime`, `endTime`, and `duration` improve readability.
* **Informative Output:** Includes both the result of the calculation (optional) and the execution time.
* **Realistic Example:** Uses a loop that takes a measurable amount of time to execute.


How to use it:

1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.java` file (e.g., `MeasureExecutionTime.java`).
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler: `javac MeasureExecutionTime.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java MeasureExecutionTime`


The output will show the calculated sum (if you keep the `println` for the sum) and the execution time of the code within the timed block, in nanoseconds.  The execution time will vary slightly each time you run the code.
