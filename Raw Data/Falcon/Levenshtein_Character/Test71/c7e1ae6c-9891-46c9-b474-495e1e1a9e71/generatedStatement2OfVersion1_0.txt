**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling with Try-with-Resources:** The code uses a `try-with-resources` block. This ensures that the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed, even if an exception occurs.  This is crucial for preventing resource leaks.

2. **Clearer Error Message:** The `catch` block now provides a more informative error message, including the specific exception message. This helps in debugging.

3. **Path Parameterization:**  The file path is now a variable (`filePath`). This makes it easier to change the file you're reading without modifying the core code.  *Remember to replace `"path/to/your/coat.txt"` with the correct path on your system.*

4. **Line-by-Line Reading:** The `BufferedReader` reads the file line by line, which is efficient for handling potentially large files.  It doesn't try to load the entire file into memory at once.

5. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the purpose of each part of the code.

**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ReadCoatTextFile.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac ReadCoatTextFile.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java ReadCoatTextFile`

Make sure the `coat.txt` file exists at the path you specify in the code.  If the file is in the same directory as the Java file, you can just use the filename:  `String filePath = "coat.txt";`
