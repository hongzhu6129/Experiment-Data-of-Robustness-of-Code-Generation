This code demonstrates two primary ways to concatenate strings in Java:

1. **Using the `+` operator:** This is the simplest and most common way.

2. **Using the `concat()` method:**  This is an alternative method provided by the `String` class.  It's functionally equivalent to `+` in most cases.

The code also includes a section that handles command-line arguments.  If you run the program with two arguments, it will concatenate those and print the result.  This demonstrates how to make your string concatenation more dynamic.  For example, to run it from the command line with arguments, you would do:
