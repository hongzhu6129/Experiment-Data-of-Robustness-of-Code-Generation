**Test Cases:**

While this program doesn't take any input and therefore doesn't have traditional "corner cases" like invalid input or edge values, we can still consider a few things to ensure it behaves as expected:

1. **Visual Inspection:**  The most crucial test is to run the program and visually verify that the output resembles a face as intended.  Check for proper alignment of characters and the overall shape.

2. **Character Encoding:**  Ensure the output is displayed correctly across different operating systems and consoles, which might have varying character encodings. This is less of an issue with basic ASCII characters like those used here, but it's still a good practice to be mindful of.

3. **Redirection to a File:**  Redirect the output to a file and then compare the contents of the file against the expected output.  This can be useful for automated testing. For example, in a bash or similar shell:
