Key improvements:

* **Clearer Error Handling:**  Uses `IllegalArgumentException` to signal invalid inputs (null, empty string).
* **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes tests for empty strings and cases where there might not be a unique character (although the problem statement says there always is one).
* **Efficiency:** Uses a single `int[]` array for character counts, which is efficient.
* **Correctness:**  Accurately finds the index of the *first* unique character.
* **Adheres to Prompt:** Strictly uses only the specified method signatures.
* **Documentation:**  Javadoc comments added for clarity.
