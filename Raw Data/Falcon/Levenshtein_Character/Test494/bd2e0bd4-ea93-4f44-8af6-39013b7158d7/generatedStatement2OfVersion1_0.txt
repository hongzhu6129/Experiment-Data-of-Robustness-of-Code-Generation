Key improvements and explanations:

* **Corrected Formula:** The provided formula in the prompt had a `+ (1/9)` which should have been a `- (1/7)` to alternate signs correctly in the Leibniz formula for pi.  This has been fixed.
* **Explicit Doubles:**  Using `1.0` and `3.0` etc., ensures floating-point division, which is crucial for accuracy in this calculation. Integer division would truncate the results and lead to an incorrect approximation.
* **Clearer Output:**  Labeling the outputs as "Approximation 1" and "Approximation 2" makes the results easier to understand.
* **Conciseness:** The code directly calculates the approximations in the `println` statements for brevity.  You could break them down into separate variables if you preferred a more step-by-step approach for debugging.


How to compile and run:

1. Save the code as `ApproximatePi.java`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Compile: `javac ApproximatePi.java`
5. Run: `java ApproximatePi`


The output will then show the two approximations of pi.
