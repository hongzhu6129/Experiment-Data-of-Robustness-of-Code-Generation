**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases, including corner cases, to test the Java program:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Output: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Coordinates:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -74
   - Expected Output: 0 km

3. **North and South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0 
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0 (Longitude doesn't matter at poles)
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)


4. **Opposite sides of the Earth:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 180
   - Expected Output: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

5. **Near Antipodal Points (not exactly opposite but close):**
    - lat1: 45
    - lon1: -70
    - lat2: -44.5 // Almost opposite latitude
    - lon2: 111   // Roughly opposite longitude  (-70 + 180 = 110)
    - Expected output: Close to, but slightly less than, Earth's circumference / 2

6. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 20
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: -160 
   - Expected Output: ~17744.74 km


7. **Invalid Input (Optional):**  You could add error handling to your program to test invalid input:
   - lat1: 91 (out of range)
   - ...



**How to Run Test Cases:**

You can manually enter these test cases into the console or (better yet) modify the Java program to accept command-line arguments or read inputs from a file to automate the testing process.  This would give you more consistent and efficient testing.  For example, you could create a text file with the test cases and then read them in one by one.


Example of testing with file input (modify your `EarthDistance.java`):
