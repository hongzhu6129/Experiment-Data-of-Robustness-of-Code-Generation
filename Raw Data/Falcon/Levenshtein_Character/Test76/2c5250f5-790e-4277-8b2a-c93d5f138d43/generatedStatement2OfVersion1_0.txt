**Test Cases:**

Here are some test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

1. **Provided Example:**
   - lat1: 25
   - lon1: 35
   - lat2: 35.5
   - lon2: 25.5
   - Expected Distance: ~1480.08 km

2. **Same Point:**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74
   - lat2: 40
   - lon2: -74
   - Expected Distance: 0 km

3. **North & South Poles:**
   - lat1: 90  (North Pole)
   - lon1: 0 
   - lat2: -90 (South Pole)
   - lon2: 0  (Longitude doesn't matter at the poles)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 km (approximately Earth's circumference / 2)

4. **Antipodes (Opposite sides of Earth):**
   - lat1: 40
   - lon1: -74 (New York)
   - lat2: -40
   - lon2: 106 (Near Perth, Australia � roughly antipodal to New York)
   - Expected Distance: ~20015.08 / 2 =  ~10007.54  km (halfway around the world)

5. **Points on the Equator:**
   - lat1: 0
   - lon1: 0
   - lat2: 0
   - lon2: 90
   - Expected Distance: ~10007.54 km (quarter way around the Earth)




6. **Points near the International Date Line:**
   - lat1: 10
   - lon1: 179
   - lat2: 10
   - lon2: -179
   - Expected Distance: Small distance (because they are close despite the large longitude difference)



7. **Invalid Input (optional):**
   - lat1: 100 (latitude out of range -90 to 90 )
   - lon1: 200 (longitude out of range -180 to 180)
   -  Your code should ideally handle these gracefully (e.g., throw an exception, print an error message).


**How to Test:**

You can modify the `main` method of the Java program to hardcode these test cases or use a testing framework like JUnit to automate the tests. JUnit would provide a more structured way to define and run your test cases, assert expected outcomes, and handle potential exceptions.
