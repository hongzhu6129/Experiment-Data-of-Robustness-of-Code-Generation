Explanation:

1. **Import necessary classes:**
   - `java.time.LocalDate`:  Represents a date (year, month, day).
   - `java.time.Month`: An enum representing the months of the year.
   - `java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit`: Provides utility methods for working with time units (like months).

2. **Get current date:**
   - `LocalDate currentDate = LocalDate.now();` obtains the current date.

3. **Get end-of-year date:**
   - `LocalDate endOfYear = LocalDate.of(currentDate.getYear(), Month.DECEMBER, 31);` creates a `LocalDate` object representing December 31st of the current year.

4. **Calculate months remaining:**
   - `ChronoUnit.MONTHS.between(currentDate, endOfYear)` calculates the number of months between the current date and the end of the year. The `ChronoUnit.MONTHS` part specifies that we want the difference in months.

5. **Alternative calculation (including the current month):**
    - The provided alternative calculation adds `1` to the result only if it's NOT the first day of the month, effectively adding the remainder of the current month to the count of full months remaining.

6. **Print the result:**
   - `System.out.println()` displays the calculated `monthsLeft`.


This improved version uses the modern `java.time` API (introduced in Java 8), which is preferred over older classes like `Date` and `Calendar` because it's more clear, concise, and handles time zones and other date/time concepts more effectively.
