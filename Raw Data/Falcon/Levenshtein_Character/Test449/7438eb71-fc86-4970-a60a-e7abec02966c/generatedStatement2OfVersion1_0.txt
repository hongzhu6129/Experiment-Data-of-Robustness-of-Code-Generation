Key improvements in this version:

* **Separate Comparator Class:** The `StringLengthComparator` is now a separate, named inner class.  This is better practice for organization and reusability.
* **Clearer Demonstration:**  The `main` method demonstrates both how to use the `Comparator` with the `TreeMap` constructor and how to use the `compare()` method directly for other comparison purposes (outside the TreeMap).
* **Concise Commenting:** Comments explain the key parts of the code.
* **Integer.compare():** Uses `Integer.compare()` for length comparison, which handles potential integer overflow issues more robustly than simply subtracting lengths.


How to Compile and Run:

1. Save the code as `TreeMapSort.java`.
2. Compile: `javac TreeMapSort.java`
3. Run: `java TreeMapSort`


The output will show the TreeMap sorted by the lengths of the keys (shortest to longest).  It will also demonstrate the direct usage of the `compare` method.
