Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clear Comments:**  The code is well-commented to explain the logic step-by-step.
2. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code includes handling for empty and null input arrays, which is important for robustness.
3. **Educational Print Statements:** The `main` method demonstrates usage with multiple examples, including edge cases, and prints both the updated array (for visualization) and the new length.
4. **Efficiency:**  The algorithm is efficient (O(n) time complexity) as it traverses the array only once.
5. **Clear Variable Names:** Using descriptive names like `uniqueIndex` improves code readability. 


This enhanced example provides a better educational experience and demonstrates good coding practices.
