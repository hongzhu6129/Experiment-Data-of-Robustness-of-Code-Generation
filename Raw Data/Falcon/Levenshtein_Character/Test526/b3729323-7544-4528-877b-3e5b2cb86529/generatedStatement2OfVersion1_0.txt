Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  The code now correctly handles empty arrays (`{}`) and `null` input.
* **Clearer variable naming:**  `uniqueIndex` is a more descriptive name than `j`.
* **Improved comments:** Comments explain the logic more clearly.
* **Comprehensive testing:**  The `main` method includes more test cases to demonstrate the code's behavior with different inputs, including edge cases.
* **Output formatting:** The output now clearly shows the new length and the updated array contents (only up to the new length), making it easier to verify the results.  `Arrays.copyOfRange` is used to avoid printing the unmodified portion of the original array.



This revised version adheres to the specified method signatures and provides a robust and well-documented solution.
