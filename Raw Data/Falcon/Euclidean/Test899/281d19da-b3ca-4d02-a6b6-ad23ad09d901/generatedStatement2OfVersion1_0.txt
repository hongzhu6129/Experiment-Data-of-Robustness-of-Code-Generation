Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `j`.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes checks for `null` or empty input arrays.

3. **Concise Logic:** The core logic for removing duplicates remains efficient and easy to understand.

4. **Comprehensive `main` Method:** Includes multiple test cases to demonstrate the functionality with various inputs (including empty and null arrays).

5. **Output Formatting:**  Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` and `Arrays.toString` in the `main` method to print only the relevant portion of the modified array (up to the new length). This makes it easier to see the result of the `removeDuplicates` function.  It also specifically handles outputting the results for an empty or null array more clearly.


This revised version addresses potential issues and presents a more robust and well-rounded solution to the problem.
