Key improvements in this version:

* **Word Boundaries (`\\b`):**  The regular expressions now use `\\b` to ensure we're matching whole words of length 3 and 4, not just substrings.  This prevents "fourteen" from being counted as both a 3-letter and a 4-letter word.
* **`\\w` for Word Characters:** The `\\w` character class matches letters, numbers, and underscores, making the matching more robust.
* **Clearer Examples in `main`:** The `main` method now demonstrates various cases, including empty strings and strings with different numbers of 3-letter and 4-letter words.
* **Handles `null` Input:** The `checkSameAppearance` method now handles the case where the input string is `null`.


This revised code addresses the potential issue of substrings being counted incorrectly and provides more comprehensive testing.
