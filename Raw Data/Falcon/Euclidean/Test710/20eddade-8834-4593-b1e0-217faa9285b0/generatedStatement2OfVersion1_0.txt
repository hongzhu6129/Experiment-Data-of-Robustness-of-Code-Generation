Key Improvements in this version:

* **Handles Edge Cases:** Properly handles `null` or empty input strings.
* **More Robust Splitting:** Uses `\\s+` in the `split` method to handle multiple spaces between words correctly.
* **Clearer Output:**  Uses `trim()` to remove trailing spaces from the output.
* **Uses Collections.reverse():**  A more concise and efficient way to reverse the characters in each word.


This revised code addresses the limitations of the previous version and provides a more complete and reliable solution for reversing each word in a string.
