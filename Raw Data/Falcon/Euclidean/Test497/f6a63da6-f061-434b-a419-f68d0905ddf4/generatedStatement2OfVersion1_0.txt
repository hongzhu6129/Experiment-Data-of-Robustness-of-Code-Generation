Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Efficiency:** The code is optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations. It stops the outer loop when `a^3` exceeds `n` and the inner loops when a second representation is found.

2. **Correctness:** The code correctly handles the requirement for *distinct* pairs. The inner loops ensure that `b < a` and `d != b`. We don't want solutions where the pairs are just swapped, e.g. (1,12) and (12,1) are considered the same. Also the use of `Math.round()` along with checking if `c*c*c == diff` is a better way for calculating cubic roots of integers.

3. **Clarity:** Variable names and comments are improved for better readability.



This revised version provides a more efficient and accurate solution to the Ramanujan number problem within the constraints of a single `main` method.
