Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Avoids Duplicate Pairs:**  The inner loop for `b` now starts from `a + 1`. This is crucial to avoid counting the same pair of cubes twice (e.g., 1^3 + 12^3 and 12^3 + 1^3).

2. **Optimization with `break`:**  If the sum `a*a*a + b*b*b` exceeds `n`, there's no point in continuing the inner loops. The `break` statement efficiently exits the inner loops in such cases.

3. **Clearer Output:** The output now clearly shows both ways the number can be expressed as the sum of two cubes.

4. **Option for Finding Only One Number:** I've added a commented-out `return` statement. If you only want the program to find the *first* such number and then exit, uncomment this line.

5. **Correct Inner Loop Bounds:** The inner loop for `c` goes up to `b-1`, and the loop for `d` can potentially go up to `n` (or you could optimize it further, but for simplicity, I've kept it as `n`).  This ensures we find all distinct pairs.


How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `Ramanujan.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:  `javac Ramanujan.java`
3. **Run:**  `java Ramanujan`


The output for `n = 1729` will be:
