Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Output:**  Added separators (`---`) and more descriptive labels for each method demonstrated.
2. **String Formatting (Method 4):**  Uses `String.format()`  for more organized and readable output, especially when IDs or names might have varying lengths.  `%-5d` creates a 5-character wide field for the product ID and left-aligns the number within it.
3. **Multiple Methods:** Demonstrates several common ways to iterate through a map and access its key-value pairs. This provides a more comprehensive understanding of the available options.
4. **Comments:** Added explanatory comments to the code to make it easier to follow.
5. **Java 8 Stream API:** Includes an example using the Stream API (`forEach`), which is a concise and modern way to iterate through collections.
6. **Example Data:**  Uses a `HashMap` with some sample product data, making it easier to see how the output is generated.


This revised response provides a more complete and practical solution to the problem of generating a catalogue view of a map's contents.
