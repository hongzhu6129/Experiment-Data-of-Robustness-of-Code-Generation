**Test cases:**

* **Corner cases:**
    * Input string is empty
    * Sequence is empty
    * Sequence is longer than the input string
* **Normal cases:**
    * Input string contains the sequence
    * Input string does not contain the sequence
    * Sequence is at the beginning of the input string
    * Sequence is at the end of the input string
    * Sequence is in the middle of the input string

**Example test cases:**

* **Corner cases:**
    * Input string: ""
    * Sequence: ""
    * Sequence: "abc" (input string is "ab")
* **Normal cases:**
    * Input string: "abcde"
    * Sequence: "bc"
    * Input string: "abcde"
    * Sequence: "ef"
    * Input string: "abcde"
    * Sequence: "ab"
    * Input string: "abcde"
    * Sequence: "de"
    * Input string: "abcde"
    * Sequence: "cde"
