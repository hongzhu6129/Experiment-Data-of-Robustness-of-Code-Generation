Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:**  The `sort` method now correctly handles `null` and empty input arrays.
* **Clearer comments:** The comments explain the logic of the partitioning process in `quickSort` more clearly.
* **Added tests in `main`:** The `main` method now includes tests with an empty array and a `null` array to demonstrate the robust handling of these edge cases.
* **Uses a more common pivot selection:** The pivot is now chosen as the middle element using `arr[low + (high - low) / 2]`. This helps prevent worst-case scenarios with already sorted or nearly sorted arrays.  This avoids potential integer overflow that could happen if you simply do  `(low + high)/2`.


This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and demonstrates good coding practices.
