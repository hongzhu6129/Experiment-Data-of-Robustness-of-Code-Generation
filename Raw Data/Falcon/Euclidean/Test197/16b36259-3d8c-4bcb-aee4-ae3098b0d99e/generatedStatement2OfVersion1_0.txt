Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct Pivot Selection and Partitioning:**  The pivot selection is now improved by using the middle element `array[lowerIndex+(higherIndex-lowerIndex)/2]`.  This helps avoid worst-case scenarios with already sorted or nearly sorted data.  The partitioning logic is also more robust.
* **Handling Edge Cases:**  The code now handles cases where the input array is `null` or empty.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Variable names like `lowerIndex` and `higherIndex` are more descriptive than `lower` and `higher`.
* **Comments:** Added comments explaining key parts of the code, making it more understandable.
* **Output:** The `main` method now prints the sorted array, which is essential for verifying the correctness of the algorithm.


This improved version addresses the issues present in the previous responses and provides a more correct and robust implementation of Quicksort.
