This is just a basic example; a robust test suite would cover many more scenarios, especially boundary conditions and error handling.  You can add exception handling to the `Rectangle` class itself to handle invalid inputs (like negative length or width) more gracefully.


This enhanced response gives a much more detailed and practical way to test the code, particularly using the JUnit framework, which is standard for Java testing.  It also includes a more complete set of test cases.
