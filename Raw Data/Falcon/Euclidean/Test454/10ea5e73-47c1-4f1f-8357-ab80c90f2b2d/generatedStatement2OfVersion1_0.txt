**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Node Class:** A `Node` class is defined to represent the nodes of the binary tree. Each node stores its data and references to its left and right children.

2. **maxDepth(Node node):**  This recursive method calculates the maximum depth.
   - **Base Case:** If `node` is `null` (empty tree or end of a path), it returns 0.
   - **Recursive Step:** It recursively calculates the depth of the left and right subtrees.  Then, it returns the maximum of these depths plus 1 (to account for the current node).

3. **main(String[] args):**
   - Example usage: Creates a sample binary tree and calls `maxDepth()` to find its height.
   - Includes test cases for empty tree and single-node tree to demonstrate correctness.
   - Clear output messages make the results easy to understand.




**Key Improvements over Simpler Solutions:**

- **Handles Edge Cases:** Explicitly handles the case of an empty tree (`node == null`), preventing `NullPointerExceptions`.
- **Clearer Code Structure:** Uses a separate `Node` class to represent tree nodes, making the code more organized and readable.
- **Comprehensive Testing:**  Includes test cases for different scenarios (empty tree, single node, more complex tree) to ensure robustness. 
- **Explanatory Comments:**  Comments throughout the code explain the logic and purpose of each part.


This improved version provides a complete and robust solution to the problem of finding the maximum depth of a binary tree in Java.
