Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity and Readability:**  Better comments and formatting.
* **Time Zones:**  Demonstrates how to handle time zones using `ZonedDateTime` and `ZoneId`, which is crucial for real-world applications.  The example shows how to get the current time in UTC.
* **Flexibility:** Shows how to calculate the previous time using `minus()` and `ChronoUnit`, making it easy to adapt to different time intervals (minutes, hours, days, etc.).
* **Individual Components:** Shows how to access year, month, day, hour, minute, and second if you need those specific values.
* **Error Handling (removed):** The `try-catch` for `DateTimeParseException` isn't needed when using `LocalDateTime.now()` or `ZonedDateTime.now()` directly.  We only need it when parsing a String into a date/time.


This revised code provides a more complete and robust solution for getting the current, previous, and specific time components in Java.
