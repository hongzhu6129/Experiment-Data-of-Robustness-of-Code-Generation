Key Improvements:

1. **Handles Zero Inputs:** The code now explicitly throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if either input is zero, as per the problem's requirement of handling only non-zero inputs.
2. **Handles Negative Numbers:**  Correctly handles multiplication with negative numbers by tracking the sign separately.
3. **Clearer Recursive Approach:** The recursive function `multiplyRecursive` is now more concise and easier to understand. It correctly handles the base cases (b=1 and b = 0) making it complete.
4. **Thorough Testing in `main`:** The `main` method demonstrates various test cases, including positive, negative, and zero inputs (to show the exception handling).

This revised version addresses the limitations of the previous responses and provides a more robust and accurate solution to the problem.
