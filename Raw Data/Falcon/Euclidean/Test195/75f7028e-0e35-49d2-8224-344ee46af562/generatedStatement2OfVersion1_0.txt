Here's how this code addresses the problem, adhering to the provided method signatures:

1. **`CountCharacters(String, int[])`**: This method efficiently counts the occurrences of each letter (case-insensitively) in the input string.  It uses an integer array `charCounts` of size 26 (for English lowercase letters) as a frequency counter.


2. **`showDuplicates(String)`**:  This method does the following:
   - Initializes `charCounts` to store character counts.
   - Calls `CountCharacters` to populate `charCounts`.
   - Iterates through `charCounts`. If a count is greater than 1, the corresponding character is a duplicate and printed.
   -  Handles cases where no duplicates are found.



3. **`main(String[])`**: The `main` method provides example strings to test the `showDuplicates` method, ensuring the code works as expected.



Key improvements in this revised version:

- **Case-Insensitivity:** The code now treats "P" and "p" as the same character.
- **Clarity and Readability:**  Comments and variable names are more descriptive.
- **Handles "No Duplicates" Case:** The code now explicitly informs the user if there are no duplicate characters.
- **Conciseness and Efficiency:** The logic is more straightforward and efficient.
