Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Names and Comments:** The method names and comments are more descriptive, explaining the purpose of each part of the code.
2. **Helper Function `containsDigit7`:**  This function makes the code more readable and modular by separating the logic of checking for the digit 7.
3. **Main Method with Examples:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `count_nums_not_7` function with a few examples, including cases where 'a' contains 7 and where 'a' is 7 itself.
4. **Efficiency:**  The code is reasonably efficient for moderate values of 'a'. For extremely large values, further optimizations might be considered (though not usually needed for this kind of problem).
