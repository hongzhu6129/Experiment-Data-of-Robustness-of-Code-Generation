Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Comparator Implementation:** The `StringLengthComparator` is now a separate, named inner class. This improves code readability and organization.

2. **Descending Sort Logic:**  The `compare` method correctly implements descending sorting by comparing `s2.length()` with `s1.length()`.

3. **Example with Ascending Order:** An additional example is included to show how to sort in ascending order, both by string length and using natural string ordering.  This demonstrates flexibility.

4. **Conciseness and Correctness:** The code is more concise and adheres strictly to the requested method signatures (`main` and `compare`).

5. **Comments and Explanations:**  Comments are added to explain the code's functionality and the sorting logic.

6. **Reusing Data:**  The ascending TreeMap example reuses the data from the descending one, making the code more efficient.


This revised code provides a complete and accurate solution to the problem while adhering to the specified method signature restrictions. It also offers more clarity and demonstrates both ascending and descending sorting options.
