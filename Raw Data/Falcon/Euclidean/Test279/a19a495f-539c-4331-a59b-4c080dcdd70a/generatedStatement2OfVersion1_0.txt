Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles Edge Cases:**  Explicitly handles `null` and empty arrays.
- **Clearer Variable Names:** `uniqueIndex` makes the purpose more obvious.
- **Improved Comments:**  Explains the logic concisely.
- **Illustrative `main` Method:**  Demonstrates usage with multiple test cases, including edge cases, and prints the updated array for better visualization.
- **Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`:**  In the `main` method, `Arrays.copyOfRange` is used to print only the relevant part of the modified array (up to `newLength`),  avoiding printing the remaining "garbage" values after the unique elements.


This version adheres to the requested method signatures while providing robust and understandable code.
