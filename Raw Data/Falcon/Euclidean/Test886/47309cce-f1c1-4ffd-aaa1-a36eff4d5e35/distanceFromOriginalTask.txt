nullInput Sentence 1:  \nWrite a Java program to check whether a number is an automorphic number or not. In mathematics, an automorphic number is a number whose square ends in the same digits as the number itself. For example, 5 = 25, 6 = 36, 76 = 5776, and 890625 = 793212890625, so 5, 6, 76 and 890625 are all automorphic numbers.\nInput a number : 76                                                   \nAutomorphic Number.\n\n\n Input Sentence 2: 6. write a Java program to check could a number is an automorphic number or not. in mathematics, an automorphic number is a number whose square ends in the same digits as the number itself. for example, 5 = 25, 6 = 36, 76 = 5776, and 890625 = 793212890625, so 5, 6, 76 and 890625 are all automorphic numbers. input a number: 76 automorphic number.Cosine Similarity: 0.9986Euclidean Distance: 0.1475
