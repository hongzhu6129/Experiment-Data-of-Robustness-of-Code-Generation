Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Signature:** The `ternary_search` method signature now correctly reflects its purpose: `static int ternary_search(int[] arr, int left, int right, int target)`.

2. **Recursive Implementation:**  The `ternary_search` uses recursion, dividing the search space into thirds with each call.

3. **Two Midpoints:**  Calculates `mid1` and `mid2` to divide the array into three parts.

4. **Comparison and Recursive Calls:** Compares the target with elements at `mid1` and `mid2`.  Makes recursive calls on the appropriate sub-array based on the comparison results.

5. **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes checks (`right >= left`) to prevent infinite recursion when the element is not found.

6. **Returns -1 for Not Found:** Returns -1 to indicate that the target element is not present in the array.

7. **Example Usage in `main`:**  Demonstrates how to use the `ternary_search` method with sample data, including a case where the element is not found.


This revised code provides a functional and correct implementation of ternary search in Java, adhering to the specified method signatures and incorporating best practices.
