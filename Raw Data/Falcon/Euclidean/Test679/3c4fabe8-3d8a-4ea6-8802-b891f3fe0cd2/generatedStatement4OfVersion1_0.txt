**Key improvements in this version:**

- **Clearer Method Names:**  `showPermutation` is a more descriptive name than just `permutation`.
- **Simplified Logic:**  The code is more concise and easier to understand.
- **Correct Handling of Repetition:** The code now correctly generates permutations *with* repetition, as requested in the prompt.
