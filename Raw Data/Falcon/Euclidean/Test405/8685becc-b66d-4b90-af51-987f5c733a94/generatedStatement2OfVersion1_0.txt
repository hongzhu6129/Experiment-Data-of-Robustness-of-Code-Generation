**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The code explicitly handles cases where the input array is `null` or empty, returning 0 as the length.

2. **In-Place Modification:** The `removeDuplicates` function modifies the original array `nums` in place. The unique elements are moved to the beginning of the array.

3. **Clearer Variable Names:** Using `uniqueCount` instead of just `i` or `count` makes the code more readable.

4. **Efficient Logic:** The logic is streamlined and avoids unnecessary comparisons. It iterates through the array only once.

5. **Comprehensive Testing:**  The `main` method includes test cases with different arrays (including empty and null) to demonstrate the correctness of the code.

6. **Outputting the modified Array:** The code in `main` now also prints the modified array (up to the `newLength`) using `Arrays.copyOfRange`, which provides a clear view of the result.


This revised solution is more robust, efficient, and easier to understand, adhering to best practices for coding.  It directly answers the problem description's requirement of finding the updated length and also shows how the array is modified.
