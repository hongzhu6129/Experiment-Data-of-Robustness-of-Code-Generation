**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Clarity and Readability:**  Comments are added to explain the logic, and variable names are more descriptive.

2. **Efficiency:**
   - The outer loop only iterates up to `p * p <= n`. This optimization is because if a number `n` is not prime, it must have a divisor less than or equal to its square root. 
   - The inner loop starts from `p * p` because all smaller multiples of `p` would have already been marked by previous iterations.

3. **Correctness:** The code now handles the edge cases of `n <= 1` correctly.  If `n` is 1 or less, there are no primes, so an empty array is returned.

4. **Conciseness:** The code is slightly more compact and avoids unnecessary code duplication.

5. **Adherence to prompt:** The code uses *only* the specified method signatures: `private static int[] generatePrimes(int)` and `public static void main(String[])`.


This improved version is more efficient, easier to understand, and correctly handles various input scenarios.  It also demonstrates good Java coding practices.
