**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Handles Null and Empty Inputs:** The `removeDuplicates` method now correctly handles cases where the input array is `null` or empty. It returns 0 in these scenarios.

2. **Clearer Variable Naming:** The `uniqueIndex` variable is more descriptive than just `i` or `j`, indicating its purpose.

3. **Concise Return:** The return statement is simplified to `uniqueIndex + 1`.

4. **Comprehensive Main Method:** The `main` method includes more test cases, demonstrating the function's behavior with different inputs, including edge cases like empty and null arrays.  It also uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to clearly print only the updated portion of the array.  This prevents displaying the original, unchanged elements after the unique portion.


This revised code adheres to the requested method signatures, provides clear explanations, and incorporates robust error handling for edge cases. It efficiently removes duplicates from a sorted array and returns the correct new length.
