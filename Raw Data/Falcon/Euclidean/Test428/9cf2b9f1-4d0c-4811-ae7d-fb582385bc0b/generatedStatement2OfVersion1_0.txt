Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Method Separation:** Two distinct methods for creating max PriorityQueues are demonstrated:
   - Using `Collections.reverseOrder()` (preferred for generality).
   - Multiplying by -1 (for numerical types only).

2. **Custom Object Example:** Includes an example of creating a max PriorityQueue for custom objects using a `Comparator`. This demonstrates how to handle more complex scenarios.

3. **Improved Output:** The output is formatted to be more readable, showing the PriorityQueue's contents clearly.


4. **Explanation within comments:** The code includes comments that explain each method and how it works.


Choose the method that best suits your needs:

- `Collections.reverseOrder()`:  The most general and recommended approach. Works with any comparable data type.
- Multiplying by -1: Simpler for numerical data, but less flexible.
- Custom `Comparator`: Necessary when working with custom objects or needing a specific ordering logic.
