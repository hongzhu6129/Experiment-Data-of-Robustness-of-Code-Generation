4. **Output to different consoles/terminals:** Test in different terminal environments (e.g., command prompt, PowerShell, various Linux terminals) to ensure consistent output.

5. **Integration with other programs (if applicable):** If this `printFace()` method were to be part of a larger application, you would need integration tests to ensure it interacts correctly with other parts of the program.  For example, if it was used to display a face in a graphical user interface, you'd need to test the GUI integration.

For a simple program like this, visual inspection and redirection to a file are likely sufficient.  More complex programs involving user input or interactions with other systems would require more sophisticated tests.


**Example of a very basic JUnit test (although arguably overkill for this specific case):**
