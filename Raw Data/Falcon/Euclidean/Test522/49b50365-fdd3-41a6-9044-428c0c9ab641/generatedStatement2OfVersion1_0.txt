**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **`calculateFermatNumber(int n)` method:** This helper method calculates the Fermat number for a given `n`.  It uses `Math.pow()` to perform the exponentiation. The result is cast to `long` because Fermat numbers grow very quickly and can exceed the capacity of `int`.

2. **`main` method:**
   - It prints a clear header.
   - The loop iterates from `n = 0` to `n = 9` (inclusive) to calculate and display the first 10 Fermat numbers.
   - It calls `calculateFermatNumber()` within the loop to get each Fermat number.
   - The calculated Fermat number is then printed to the console.


**Limitations with `long`:**

Even using `long`, you'll encounter overflow issues fairly quickly.  Fermat numbers grow extremely rapidly. Numbers beyond the fifth Fermat number (65537) will exceed the maximum value that a `long` can hold and will result in incorrect output due to overflow.

**Handling Larger Fermat Numbers (If needed):**

If you need to work with Fermat numbers beyond the first few, you'll have to use `BigInteger` which can handle arbitrarily large integers:
