Key improvements and explanations in the code:

* **Handling invalid inputs:** The `multiplyBinary` method now handles `null` and empty string inputs gracefully, returning "0" in those cases.  This prevents `NullPointerException` or other unexpected behavior.

* **Clearer Conversion Methods:** `binaryToDecimal` and `decimalToBinary` are separated for better readability and maintainability.

* **Comprehensive Test Cases:**  The test cases cover various scenarios, including:
    * Normal multiplication
    * Multiplication with zero (corner case)
    * Multiplication with one
    * `null` inputs (corner case)
    * Empty string inputs (corner case)
    * Large number multiplication to demonstrate no overflow (important because we are now handling the multiplication as a string).



This revised answer provides a more robust and well-tested solution for binary multiplication in Java.  The use of JUnit ensures that the code works correctly under various conditions.  Remember to include the JUnit library in your project to run these tests.
