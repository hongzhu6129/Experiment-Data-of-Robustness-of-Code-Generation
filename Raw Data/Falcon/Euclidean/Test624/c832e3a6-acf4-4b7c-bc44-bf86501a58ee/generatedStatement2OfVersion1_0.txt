**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Handles Command-Line Arguments:** The code now accepts the string, character to replace, and replacement character as command-line arguments. This makes it more flexible and reusable.

2. **Error Handling:**  It includes basic error handling to check if single characters are provided for replacement.  It prints an error message if the input is incorrect.

3. **Clearer Usage Instructions:** The `else` block provides instructions on how to run the program from the command line.

4. **Example for Clarity:** If no command-line arguments are given, it runs a built-in example so the user can immediately see how it works.


**How to Compile and Run (with command-line arguments):**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `ReplaceCharacter.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile: `javac ReplaceCharacter.java`
3. **Run:**  `java ReplaceCharacter "hello world" "l" "X"`  (This will replace 'l' with 'X').  Replace the arguments in quotes with your desired string and characters.


**How to Run (without command-line arguments - will use the hardcoded example):**

1. **Compile:**  `javac ReplaceCharacter.java`
2. **Run:** `java ReplaceCharacter` (This will run the `abracadabra` example).
