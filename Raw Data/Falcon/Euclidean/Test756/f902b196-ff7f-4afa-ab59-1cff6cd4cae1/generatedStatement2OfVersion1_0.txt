Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  Explicitly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays.
- **Clearer variable names:** `uniqueIndex` makes the code easier to follow.
- **Comprehensive testing in `main`:** Demonstrates the function's behavior with different inputs, including edge cases.
- **Output formatting:** The `main` method now prints the length *and* the modified array (up to the new length) for better visualization.  It also handles the `null` case gracefully.  The use of `Arrays.copyOfRange` is important to avoid printing the "garbage" values beyond the new length.


This revised solution is more robust, easier to understand, and thoroughly tested.
