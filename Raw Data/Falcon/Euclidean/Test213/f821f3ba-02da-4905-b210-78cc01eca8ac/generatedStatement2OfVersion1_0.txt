This code adheres to the specified method signatures:

* **`public static void main(String[] args)`:** This is the entry point.  It calls `printMatrix` with a sample value (5 in this case). You can change this value to print a different sized matrix.
* **`public static void printMatrix(int n)`:** This method takes the size `n` as input and prints the n-by-n matrix.  Inside the nested loops, `i` represents the row number, and `j` represents the column number.  The code currently prints the column index `j`. You can modify this to print any desired value or pattern within the matrix.


**Example Output (for n=5):**
