...Converting Roman Numerals to Integers

Roman numerals use letters to represent numbers.  The basic symbols are:
I = 1
V = 5
X = 10
L = 50
C = 100
D = 500
M = 1000

Numbers are formed by combining symbols, generally from largest to smallest.
For example, LXXVI is 50 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 76
However, there are subtractive cases:
IV = 4 (not 6)
IX = 9 (not 11)
XL = 40
XC = 90
CD = 400
CM = 900

Let's convert some examples:

Roman: III  Integer: 3   (Expected: 3)
Roman: IV  Integer: 4   (Expected: 4)
Roman: IX  Integer: 9   (Expected: 9)

Explanation for IX:
I before X means subtraction: 10 - 1 = 9

Roman: LVIII  Integer: 58   (Expected: 58)
Roman: MCMXCIV  Integer: 1994   (Expected: 1994)

Explanation for MCMXCIV:
M = 1000
CM = 900 (C before M)
XC = 90 (X before C)
IV = 4 (I before V)
1000 + 900 + 90 + 4 = 1994

Roman: DCXXI  Integer: 621   (Expected: 621)
