Key improvements and explanations in this version:

* **Clearer Interval Class:** The `Interval` class is well-defined with a constructor, `getStart()`, and `getEnd()` methods.
* **Comparator for Sorting:**  Uses a `Comparator` with the `compare` method within `Collections.sort()` to correctly sort intervals based on their start times. This is crucial for the merging logic to work properly.
* **Handles Edge Cases:** Includes checks for `null` or empty input in the `merge` method, making it more robust.
* **Correct Merging Logic:** The merging logic now accurately handles overlapping and adjacent intervals.
* **Adds Last Interval:**  Correctly adds the last processed interval to the `mergedIntervals` list after the loop finishes.
* **Example Usage in main:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to create and merge a sample list of intervals.
* **toString() Method:** Added a `toString()` method to the `Interval` class for cleaner output.



This revised code addresses the prompt's requirements effectively and provides a more complete and functional solution.  It also adheres to best practices for Java code structure and clarity.
