Key improvements in this version:

- **Dynamic Programming (Memoization):** The `lookup` table is used to store the results of subproblems. This avoids redundant calculations and significantly improves performance, especially for larger input strings.
- **Handling trailing '*'):** The code correctly handles cases where `str2` has trailing '*' characters.
- **Clearer base cases:** The base cases for recursion are more explicitly defined, making the logic easier to follow.
- **Conciseness:** The code is slightly more concise while maintaining readability.  



This enhanced version addresses the limitations of the previous response and provides a much more efficient and robust solution for wildcard string matching.
