**Explanation:**

1. **Input:** The `main` method uses a `Scanner` to get three integer inputs from the user.
2. **`test` Method:** The `test` method takes the three numbers and a boolean `abc` as input.
3. **Conditional Logic:** Inside `test`, it checks the value of `abc`:
   - If `abc` is `true`, it only checks if `num3` is greater than `num2`.  The condition `num2 > num1` is ignored.
   - If `abc` is `false` (the default in this example), it checks if `num2` is greater than `num1` AND `num3` is greater than `num2`.
4. **Output:** The `main` method prints the boolean result returned by the `test` method.
5. **Resource Management:**  The `scanner.close()` statement is included to release the `Scanner`'s resources, which is good practice.



**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `NumberComparison.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler:
