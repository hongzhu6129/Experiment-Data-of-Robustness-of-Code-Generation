Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles null and empty arrays:**  The code now explicitly checks for `null` arrays and empty arrays.  This prevents `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` errors.
* **Clearer logic:** The comparison logic is now more concise and easier to understand.
* **More test cases in `main`:** Demonstrates the behavior with different array scenarios, including empty arrays and single-element arrays.
* **Private helper method:** The comparison logic is extracted to a separate `compareFirstAndLast` method, which makes the `main` method cleaner and more focused on testing.  The helper method is `private` because it's intended for internal use within the class.


This revised answer addresses the potential problems of the previous versions and provides a more robust and well-structured solution.
