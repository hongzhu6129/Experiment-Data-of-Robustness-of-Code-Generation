Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n`:  The total number of coins.
   - `row`: Keeps track of the current row number (starts at 1).
   - `coinsInRow`: The number of coins in the current row.
   - `coinsUsed`: The total number of coins used so far.


2. **Outer `while` loop:** Continues as long as there are coins remaining (`coinsUsed < n`).

3. **Increment `coinsInRow`:**  For each row, we need one more coin than the previous row.

4. **Check for sufficient coins:** `if (coinsUsed + coinsInRow <= n)` makes sure we have enough coins to complete the current row.

5. **Print the row:**  If enough coins are available, we print `coinsInRow` asterisks (*) to represent the coins.

6. **Update `coinsUsed`:**  After printing a row, we update `coinsUsed` with the number of coins in that row.

7. **Increment `row`:** Prepare for the next row.

8. **Handling remaining coins:**  The `else` block handles the case where there aren't enough coins to complete a full row. It prints the remaining coins and then breaks out of the `while` loop.
