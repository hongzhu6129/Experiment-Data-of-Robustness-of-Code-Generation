Key improvements:

* **Clearer method names:** `is_Valid` is changed to `isValid` (standard Java naming convention) and `area_triangle` to `areaTriangle`.
* **Javadoc comments:** Added Javadoc comments to explain the purpose and parameters of each method.
* **Error handling:** `areaTriangle` returns -1 if the triangle is invalid.
* **Demonstrative main method:** The `main` method provides examples of how to use the methods.
* **Conciseness and readability:**  Improved overall code structure and readability.
* **Example of an invalid triangle added to main to show the error handling.**


This revised version is more robust, easier to understand, and adheres to standard Java coding practices.
