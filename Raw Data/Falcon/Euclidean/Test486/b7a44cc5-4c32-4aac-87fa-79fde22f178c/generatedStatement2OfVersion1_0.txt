**Explanation and how to use it:**

1. **Replace `"path/to/your/file.txt"`:**  Change this placeholder to the actual path of your text file.  For example:
   -  `"my_document.txt"` if the file is in the same directory as your Java program.
   -  `"C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\my_document.txt"` for a Windows path.
   -  `"/home/YourName/Documents/my_document.txt"` for a Linux/macOS path.

2. **Compile and run:** Compile the Java code (e.g., `javac ReadFile.java`) and then run it (e.g., `java ReadFile`).

3. **Output:** The program will print the contents of the text file to the console, line by line.


**Error Handling:**

The code includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions`.  If the file is not found, or if there's another problem reading the file, an error message will be printed to the console.

**Important Considerations:**

* **File Path:**  Make sure the file path is correct.  Relative paths are relative to where you run the Java program from, not necessarily where the `.java` file is located.
* **File Encoding:**  If your text file uses a different encoding than your system's default (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1), you might need to specify the encoding when creating the `FileReader`:
