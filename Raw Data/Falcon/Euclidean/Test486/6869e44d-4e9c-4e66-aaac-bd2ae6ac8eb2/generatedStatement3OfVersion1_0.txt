2. **Compile and Run:** Compile the Java code (e.g., `javac ReadPlainTextApplication.java`) and then run it (e.g., `java ReadPlainTextApplication`).

3. **Output:** The program will print the contents of the text file to the console, line by line.

4. **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles potential `IOExceptions` (e.g., if the file doesn't exist or there are permissions issues).  It prints an error message if something goes wrong.

5. **Try-with-resources:** The `try (BufferedReader reader = ...)` ensures that the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed, even if an exception occurs, preventing resource leaks.
