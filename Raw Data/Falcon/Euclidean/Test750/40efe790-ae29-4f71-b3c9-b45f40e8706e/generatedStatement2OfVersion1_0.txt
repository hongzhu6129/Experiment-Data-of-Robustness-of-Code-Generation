This code will output the colors in alphabetical order because `PriorityQueue` by default orders elements according to their natural ordering (which for Strings is lexicographical).  If you wanted a different order, you would provide a `Comparator` to the `PriorityQueue` constructor.  The key methods demonstrated are:

* `add(element)`: Adds an element to the queue.
* Enhanced `for` loop (or `iterator()`):  Used to traverse the queue (though the iterator doesn't guarantee priority order retrieval).
* `poll()`: Retrieves and *removes* the head (highest priority) of the queue.  Important to note that this modifies the queue.


The most common and straightforward way to print the elements without modifying the queue is using the enhanced `for` loop as shown in Method 1.
