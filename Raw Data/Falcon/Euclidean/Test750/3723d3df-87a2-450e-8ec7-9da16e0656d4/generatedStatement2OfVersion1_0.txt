**Explanation:**

1. **Import `PriorityQueue`:**  `import java.util.PriorityQueue;` imports the necessary class.
2. **Create a `PriorityQueue`:** `PriorityQueue<String> colorQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();` creates a new `PriorityQueue` that will store strings. By default, strings are ordered lexicographically (alphabetically).
3. **Add elements:** `colorQueue.add("color");` adds string elements ("colors" in this case) to the queue.
4. **Print elements:** The `while` loop iterates as long as the queue is not empty. Inside the loop, `colorQueue.poll()` retrieves and removes the head (the element with the highest priority - in this case, the lexicographically smallest string) of the queue and prints it.  This continues until all elements have been removed and printed.
