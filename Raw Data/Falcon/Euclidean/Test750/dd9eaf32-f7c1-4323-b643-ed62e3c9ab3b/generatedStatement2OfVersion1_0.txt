Explanation:

1. **Import PriorityQueue:** The `java.util.PriorityQueue` class is imported to use priority queue functionality.

2. **Create PriorityQueue:** A `PriorityQueue` named `colorQueue` is created to store strings (colors in this case). By default, a `PriorityQueue` orders elements in their natural order (for strings, this is lexicographical/alphabetical order).

3. **Add elements:**  The `add()` method adds colors to the queue.

4. **Print elements (Method 1: Destructive):** The `while` loop iterates as long as the queue is not empty. Inside the loop, `poll()` is used to retrieve and *remove* the head (the element with the highest priority � in this case, the lexicographically smallest string). This is printed to the console. This method empties the queue.

5. **Print elements (Method 2: Non-Destructive - Java 8+):** This method shows how to print the elements *without* removing them from the queue using the `forEach` method (requires Java 8 or later).  Since Method 1 emptied the queue, the code re-adds the color strings.  This is the preferred way if you need to maintain the queue after printing its contents in order.
