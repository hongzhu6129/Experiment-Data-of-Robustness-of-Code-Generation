Here's a breakdown of the improvements and test cases:

**Improvements:**

* **Explicit Exception Handling:** The code now throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the input strings are null or have a length less than 1. This makes the code more robust and helps identify invalid inputs.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** The exception messages provide more specific information about the error.
* **JUnit Tests:** The code includes JUnit tests to verify the functionality of the `concatenateStrings` method.


**Test Cases (using JUnit):**

* **`testValidStrings`:** Tests with valid strings of different lengths, including corner cases where one or both strings have a length of 1.
* **`testNullStrings`:** Tests with null input strings.
* **`testEmptyString`:** Tests with empty input strings.




This improved version addresses the issues and provides a more robust and testable solution for concatenating strings with the first character removed.
