**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code now includes robust error handling. It throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if either string is `null` or has a length less than 1. This prevents unexpected behavior.

2. **Clearer Error Messages:** The exception messages are more informative, making debugging easier.

3. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The JUnit tests cover a wider range of scenarios, including:
   - Valid strings of different lengths.
   - Single-character strings (a corner case).
   - Empty strings (a corner case).
   - `null` strings (a corner case).
   - Strings with leading/embedded spaces.
   - Strings with special characters

4. **Main Method Example:** The `main` method demonstrates how to use the function and handle potential exceptions.

5. **JUnit for Testing:** Using a testing framework like JUnit is crucial for verifying the correctness of the code and ensuring it handles edge cases appropriately.  The provided test cases demonstrate good testing practices.


**How to Run the JUnit Tests:**

If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you can usually right-click on the test class or method and select "Run".  If you're using the command line and have JUnit set up, you can compile and run the tests using the appropriate commands (e.g., `javac` and `java` with the JUnit library on the classpath).
