To compile and run this code from the command line:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `StringComparison.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run:  `javac StringComparison.java`
3. **Run:**  `java StringComparison string1 string2`  (Replace `string1` and `string2` with the strings you want to compare).


Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer explanation:**  Comments explain the difference between `.equals()` (content comparison) and `==` (reference comparison).
* **Illustrative examples:**  Shows how string interning can make `==` behave unexpectedly with string literals.
* **User input handling:**  Demonstrates a way to accept command-line arguments for more interactive testing, while staying within the `main` method's limitations.
* **Best practice recommendation:** Explicitly advises against using `==` for general string content comparisons due to interning and emphasizes `equals()` for reliability.
