**Test Cases:**

**1. Basic Case:**
   - Input: {1, 2, 3, 4} (as in the code)
   - Expected Output: 24 unique three-digit numbers (4 * 3 * 2 = 24 permutations) and the numbers themselves printed.

**2. Repeated Digits Input:**  (This tests handling of duplicates in the input which shouldn't affect the unique 3-digit number count using 1,2,3,4 if the program is correct.)
   - Input: {1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2} 
   - Expected Output: Still 24 unique three-digit numbers and the numbers themselves printed.  The duplicate 1s and 2s should be ignored.


**3. Fewer Digits Input:** (Corner Case)
   - Input: {1, 2, 3}
   - Expected Output: 6 unique three-digit numbers (3 * 2 * 1 = 6 permutations).

**4. Single Digit Input:** (Corner Case)
   - Input: {1}
   - Expected Output: 0 unique three-digit numbers.  It's impossible to form a 3-digit number with only one distinct digit. You might want to handle this with a specific message like "Not enough unique digits to form a three-digit number."


**5. Empty Input:** (Corner Case)
   - Input: {}
   - Expected Output: 0 unique three-digit numbers. A similar message as the previous case could be used.
