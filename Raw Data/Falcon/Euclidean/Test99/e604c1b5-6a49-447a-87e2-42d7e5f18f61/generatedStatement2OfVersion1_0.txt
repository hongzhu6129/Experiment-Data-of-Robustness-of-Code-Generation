**Test Cases:**

**For `generateAndDisplayFiveDigit()`:**

1. **Basic Test:** Run the program multiple times and verify that it always generates a five-digit number containing only 1, 2, 3, and 4, with no repetition of digits.

2. **Uniqueness Test:** Run the program a significant number of times (e.g., 1000) and store the generated numbers in a set. The size of the set should be equal to the number of runs, indicating that all generated numbers are unique.  (There are only 4! = 24 unique 5 digit numbers possible in this case).  So running it thousands of time demonstrates uniqueness reasonably well.
