**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **HashSet for Uniqueness:** The code now uses a `HashSet` to store the generated numbers. This automatically handles duplicates, ensuring that only unique three-digit numbers are stored and displayed.

2. **Clearer Output:** The output is formatted to be more readable, clearly showing the list of unique numbers and their count.

3. **Test Cases:**  Crucially, I've added a `test()` function and several test cases, including corner cases:
   - **Standard Case:**  Using `1, 2, 3, 4`.
   - **All Digits Same:**  Using `1, 1, 1, 1` (should produce 0 unique numbers).
   - **Fewer Than 4 Digits:** Using `1, 2, 3`.
   - **Duplicate Digits:**  Using `1, 2, 2, 3`.

4. **Error Handling in Tests (Improved):** The `test()` function now uses `System.err` to clearly indicate test failures, making it easier to debug.


**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `UniqueThreeDigitNumbers.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using: `javac UniqueThreeDigitNumbers.java`
3. **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program using:  `java UniqueThreeDigitNumbers`


The output will display the unique three-digit numbers and their count, followed by the results of the test cases. This improved version is more robust, efficient, and testable.
