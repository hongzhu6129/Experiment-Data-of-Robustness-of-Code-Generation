3. **Character-by-Character Check (More Advanced):**  You could theoretically write a separate Java program (or use a testing framework like JUnit) that captures the output stream of `AnotherFace` and checks it character by character against the expected output.  This would be more involved but would provide a more robust automated test.  It's likely overkill for this simple example though.

4. **Corner Cases (Not Applicable):** There aren't traditional "corner cases" for a program like this because it doesn't take any input.  Corner cases typically arise from unusual or boundary input values.  However, the "visual inspection" acts as a catch-all for ensuring there are no unexpected characters or formatting issues which could be considered analogous to handling corner cases.
