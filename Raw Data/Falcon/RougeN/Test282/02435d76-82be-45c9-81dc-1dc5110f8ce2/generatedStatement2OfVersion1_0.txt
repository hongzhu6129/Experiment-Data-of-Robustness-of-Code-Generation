**Explanation:**

1. **`public static void main(String[] args)`:** This is the standard entry point for Java programs.
2. **`System.out.println(...)`:** This line prints an introductory message to the console.
3. **`for (int n = 0; n < 10; n++)`:**  This loop iterates 10 times, calculating the Fermat number for each value of `n` from 0 to 9.
4. **`long fermatNumber = (long) Math.pow(2, Math.pow(2, n)) + 1;`:**  This is the core of the calculation.
   - `Math.pow(2, n)` calculates 2 raised to the power of `n`.
   - `Math.pow(2, ...)` calculates 2 raised to the power of the previous result (2^n).
   - `+ 1` adds 1 to the result, completing the Fermat number formula.
   - `(long)` casts the result to `long`. This is crucial because Fermat numbers grow very quickly, and `int` would overflow for even small values of `n`.  `long` provides a larger range, but even it will eventually be insufficient for larger Fermat numbers.
5. **`System.out.println(fermatNumber);`:**  This line prints the calculated Fermat number for the current value of `n`.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Overflow:**  As mentioned, Fermat numbers grow extremely rapidly. Even `long` will not be able to hold the exact values for n > 4. For n = 5 and beyond, you'll see incorrect results due to overflow.  To handle arbitrarily large numbers, you would need to use the `BigInteger` class in Java.
* **Efficiency:** The repeated calls to `Math.pow()` can be slightly inefficient.  For a more optimized approach (especially if you were working with `BigInteger`), you could calculate powers of 2 iteratively.
