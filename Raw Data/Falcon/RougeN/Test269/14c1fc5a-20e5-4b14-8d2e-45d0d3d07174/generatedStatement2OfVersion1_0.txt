Key improvements in the sophisticated version:

* **Generics:**  The `swapFirstLastGeneric` and `printArrayGeneric` methods use generics `<T>`, making them work with arrays of any data type (Integer, String, Double, custom objects, etc.).
* **Error Handling:** It includes a `null` check and a `try-catch` block to handle potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if there's an issue accessing the array elements. This makes it more robust.
* **Clearer handling of edge cases:**  The code explicitly addresses cases where the array is `null` or has 0 or 1 elements, preventing unexpected behavior.


This revised response provides both a basic and a more advanced, robust solution within the `main` method's constraints.
