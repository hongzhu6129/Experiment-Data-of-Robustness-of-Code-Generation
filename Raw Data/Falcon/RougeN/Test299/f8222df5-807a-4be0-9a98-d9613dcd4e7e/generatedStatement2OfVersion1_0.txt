Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Name:** `found10` is more descriptive than just `found`.
* **Efficient Inner Loop:**  The inner loop now starts from `i + 1` (the element *after* the current 10).  This avoids unnecessary checks and ensures the 20 comes *after* the 10.
* **Return True Immediately:** Once a 20 is found after a 10, the function immediately returns `true`. This is more efficient than continuing to check the rest of the array.
* **Test Cases:**  A thorough set of test cases demonstrates different scenarios and ensures the function behaves correctly.  This helps catch edge cases and improves confidence in the code's reliability.


The core logic remains similar to the previous solution, using nested loops. However, the enhanced efficiency and clarity make it a more robust and maintainable solution.
