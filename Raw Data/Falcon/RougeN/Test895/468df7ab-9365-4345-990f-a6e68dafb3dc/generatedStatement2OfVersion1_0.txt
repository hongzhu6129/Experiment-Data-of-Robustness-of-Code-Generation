Key improvements:

* **Clarity and Readability:** Added more comments and meaningful variable names.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Included multiple test cases in `main` to demonstrate different scenarios, including edge cases with null and empty strings.
* **Error Handling (Optional):**  The `removeString` method now checks for null inputs. You can customize how you want to handle nulls (e.g., throw an exception, return an empty string, etc.) depending on your requirements.


This revised code adheres to the given method signature restrictions and provides a clear, robust, and well-tested solution to the problem.
