This revised code adheres strictly to the requested method signatures, including `public static void main(String[])` and `public static int getPentagonalNumber(int)`.  It introduces a helper method `displayFirst50PentagonalNumbers()` to encapsulate the looping and printing logic, keeping the `main` method concise. The output is formatted for better readability.
