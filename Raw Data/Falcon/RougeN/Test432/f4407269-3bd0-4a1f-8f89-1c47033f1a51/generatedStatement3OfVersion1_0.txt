This JUnit example shows how to test the `sum` operation. You'd add similar `@Test` methods for the other operations (subtract, multiply, divide, remainder) and adapt the expected values according to the test case table.  Make sure you add the JUnit library to your project.  This more structured approach is better for larger projects.


This provides a comprehensive set of test cases and a basic framework for automated testing. Remember to adapt the JUnit example by creating the corresponding static methods in your `ArithmeticOperations` class.
