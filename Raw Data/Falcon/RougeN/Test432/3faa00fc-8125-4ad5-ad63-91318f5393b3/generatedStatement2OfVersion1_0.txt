**Test Cases:**

Here's a set of test cases covering various scenarios, including corner cases:

| Test Case | num1 | num2 | Expected Sum | Expected Difference | Expected Product | Expected Quotient | Expected Remainder |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Positive Numbers | 10 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 2. Negative Numbers | -10 | -5 | -15 | -5 | 50 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 3. Mixed Signs | 10 | -5 | 5 | 15 | -50 | -2.0 | 0.0 |
| 4. Zero as num1 | 0 | 5 | 5 | -5 | 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 5. Zero as num2 (Except Division) | 10 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | "Division by zero" | "Division by zero" |
| 6. Decimal Numbers | 10.5 | 2.5 | 13.0 | 8.0 | 26.25 | 4.2 | 0.0 |
| 7. Large Numbers | 100000 | 50000 | 150000 | 50000 | 5000000000.0 | 2.0 | 0.0 |
| 8. Small Numbers | 0.001 | 0.002 | 0.003 | -0.001 | 0.000002 | 0.5 | 0.0 |
| 9. Integer division with remainder | 17 | 5 | 22 | 12 | 85 | 3.4 | 2.0 |



**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. **Manually:**  Input these values into the program when prompted and verify the output against the expected results.

2. **Automated Testing (Recommended - using JUnit):**  Create a separate test class (e.g., `ArithmeticOperationsTest.java`) and use a testing framework like JUnit.  This allows for more systematic and efficient testing.  Here's a very basic example of what a JUnit test could look like:
