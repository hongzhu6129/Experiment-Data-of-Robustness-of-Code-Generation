Key improvements:

* **Clearer Explanation about "Sustainable" Properties:**  The code now explicitly explains that there is no standard Java way to get "sustainable" system properties and that this usually requires OS-specific code or external libraries.
* **Conceptual Example:**  A conceptual example (using `ProcessBuilder` as an illustration) is provided to demonstrate how you might approach getting OS-specific power information (like battery status).  This emphasizes the platform-dependent nature of these tasks.
* **Platform Check:** Includes a basic `System.getProperty("os.name")` check so that you can conditionally include the appropriate OS-specific code.  The example shows placeholders where you would integrate actual commands or library calls for your target OS.
* **Error Handling:** Basic error handling (`try-catch`) is added to handle potential exceptions during the execution of OS-specific code.





Remember:  To run the example related to battery status (using `upower`), you'll need to have `upower` installed on a Linux system.  For other operating systems (Windows, macOS), you'll need to replace the example with the appropriate OS-specific code/libraries.  This example is purely illustrative of the general approach.
