This improved version handles the following:

* **Error Handling:** Checks if a pathname argument is provided.  If not, it prints a usage message and exits with an error code.
* **File vs. Directory:**  Clearly indicates whether the existing pathname refers to a file or a directory.


This makes the code more robust and user-friendly.
