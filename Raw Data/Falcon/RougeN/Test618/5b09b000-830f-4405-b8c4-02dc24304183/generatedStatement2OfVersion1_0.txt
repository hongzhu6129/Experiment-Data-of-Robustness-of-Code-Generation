Key improvements in this version:

* **Generics:** The `getGreatestKeyLessThan` method now uses generics `<K, V>` to work with any `TreeMap` key and value types, not just `Integer` and `String`. This makes it more reusable.
* **Handles null/empty map:** It explicitly checks for `null` or empty `treeMap` and returns `null` in those cases, preventing potential `NullPointerExceptions`.
* **Clearer Example Usage:** The `main` method now demonstrates the functionality with multiple test cases including an empty `TreeMap` and a `TreeMap` with a single element, making it easier to understand how the code behaves in different scenarios.
* **Uses `lowerKey()`:**  Directly utilizes the `lowerKey()` method of `TreeMap`, which is the most efficient way to find the greatest key strictly less than the given key.
* **Conciseness:** The code is now more concise and easier to read.
* **Better commenting:**  More comments added to explain the logic.
