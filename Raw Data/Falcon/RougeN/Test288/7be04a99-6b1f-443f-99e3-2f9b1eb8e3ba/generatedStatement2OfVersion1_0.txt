**Test Cases (While these aren't automated unit tests, they represent different scenarios to consider):**

1. **Basic Functionality:**  Simply run the program as is.  Visually inspect the output to verify it matches the expected face.

2. **Output Redirection:** Redirect the output to a file and then compare the file contents to the expected output.  This helps test in environments without a direct console.
