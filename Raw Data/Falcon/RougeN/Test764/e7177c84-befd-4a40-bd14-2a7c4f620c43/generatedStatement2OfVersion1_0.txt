**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Hardcoded Test Data:** The initial part of the `main` method demonstrates the basic addition using hardcoded values 74 and 36.

2. **Command-Line Arguments:** The improved version uses `args` (command-line arguments) to make the program more flexible.  It attempts to parse the first two command-line arguments as integers and calculate their sum. The `try-catch` block handles potential `NumberFormatException` if the user provides non-numeric input.

3. **Handling "74 h 36":** The code now includes a specific check for the input "74 h 36" as requested in the problem description. Since "h" is not a valid number, we can't directly use `parseInt`. This specific block treats it as a special case.

**How to Compile and Run:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as `SumOfTwoNumbers.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile using:
