**Test Cases:**

1. **Valid Binary Number:**
   - Input: "101101"
   - Expected Output: 45

2. **Single Digit Binary:**
   - Input: "1"
   - Expected Output: 1

3. **All Zeros:**
   - Input: "000" 
   - Expected Output: 0

4. **Leading Zeros:**
   - Input: "0010"
   - Expected Output: 2

5. **Invalid Input (Non-Binary Character):**
   - Input: "10A10"
   - Expected Output: Invalid Input: Not a binary number.

6. **Empty Input:**
   - Input: ""
   - Expected Output: 0  (Could also be handled as an error depending on your requirements)

7. **Large Binary Number:**
   - Input: "11111111111111111111"  (Max Integer value testable)
   - Expected Output: 1048575 (or an appropriate error for overflow if you're not using `long`)

8. **Boundary Case (Max Integer):**
     - Input: "1111111111111111111111111111111" (for Integer.MAX_VALUE)
     - Expected Output: 2147483647 (or an error if overflow isn't handled)


**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes a check for invalid input (non-binary characters). If a non-binary character is detected, the function returns -1 to indicate an error, which the `main` method then handles.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Minor improvements in variable names and comments enhance readability.
* **Robustness:**  The test cases cover a wider range of scenarios, including invalid input, empty input, and large binary numbers to ensure the program handles different situations correctly.


This revised version is more robust and handles potential issues, making it a better solution overall.  Remember that if you need to handle very large binary numbers that could exceed the `int` range, you might consider using `long` or `BigInteger` for the `decimal` variable.
