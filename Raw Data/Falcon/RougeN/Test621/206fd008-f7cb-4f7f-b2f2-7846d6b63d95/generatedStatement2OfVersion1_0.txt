This improved version includes:

- **Clearer Explanations:**  The `main` method now provides educational explanations for each example, demonstrating how duplicates are removed and the resulting array/length.
- **Handle Edge Cases:**  The `removeDuplicates` method now correctly handles edge cases like an empty array (`{}`) or `null` input.
- **Example with No Duplicates:** Includes an example demonstrating the case where there are no duplicates in the original array. 
- **Using `Arrays.copyOfRange`:** To avoid printing the entire original array (which is modified in-place), `Arrays.copyOfRange` is used to create a copy containing only the unique elements.


This format makes the code easier to understand and learn from, showcasing the logic of duplicate removal with different scenarios.
