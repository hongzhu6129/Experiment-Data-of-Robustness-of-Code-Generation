Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Edge Cases:** The code now explicitly handles `null` and empty input arrays, returning 0 in those cases, preventing `NullPointerException` and `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. **Clearer Variable Naming:** `uniqueIndex` is used instead of `j`, which makes the code easier to understand. `uniqueIndex` keeps track of where to place the next unique element.

3. **Correct Length Calculation:** The code returns `uniqueIndex + 1` because `uniqueIndex` represents the *index* of the last unique element, so the actual length of the unique portion of the array is one greater.

4. **Efficient In-Place Modification:** The algorithm modifies the original array `nums` directly, making it space-efficient (O(1) extra space).

5. **Comprehensive Test Cases:** The `main` method includes more test cases, including empty and null arrays, to demonstrate the robustness of the code.

6. **Output Clarity:** The output now prints both the new length and the updated array (using `Arrays.copyOfRange` to avoid printing the unchanged portions of the original array), which helps visualize the results better.


This improved version provides a more robust and understandable solution to the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array.
