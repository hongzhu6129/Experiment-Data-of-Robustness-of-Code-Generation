Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Clearer Structure:** The code is organized into separate functions (`isDisarium` and `isUnhappy`) for better readability and maintainability.

2. **Correct Disarium Calculation:** The `isDisarium` function now correctly calculates the sum of digits raised to their respective positions (starting from 1).

3. **Efficient Unhappy Number Check:** The `isUnhappy` function uses a `HashSet` to detect cycles and efficiently determine if a number is unhappy.  It avoids infinite loops.

4. **Informative Output:** The `main` function prints clear messages indicating whether the input number is Disarium and/or Unhappy.

5. **Example Usage:**  The `main` method demonstrates how to use the functions with a sample input.  You can easily change the `num` variable to test other numbers.


How to Compile and Run:

1. **Save:** Save the code as `DisariumAndUnhappyNumberChecker.java`.
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using:  `javac DisariumAndUnhappyNumberChecker.java`
3. **Run:** Execute the compiled code: `java DisariumAndUnhappyNumberChecker`


Example Output (for input 135):
