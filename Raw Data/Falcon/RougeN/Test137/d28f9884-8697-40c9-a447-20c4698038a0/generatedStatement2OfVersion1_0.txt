The provided error message "invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'sort'" is unrelated to the Gnome Sort algorithm itself. It typically occurs in Python when you try to convert a string containing non-numeric characters (like "sort") into an integer using `int()`.  The provided Java code correctly implements Gnome Sort and addresses the prompt's requirement to use only `gnomeSort(int[])` and `main(String[])`.  The main method now includes more comprehensive testing with different array examples (including empty and already sorted arrays).
