   Replace `my_text_file.txt` with the actual filename.

3. **Output:** The program will print each line of the file along with its line number and the word count for that line. It also demonstrates a basic check for keywords like "error" or "warning".

**Key Improvements & Features:**

* **Error Handling:**  The code uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential `IOExceptions` that might occur if the file doesn't exist or there are problems reading it. This makes the program more robust.
* **Command-Line Arguments:** The program now takes the filename as a command-line argument, making it more flexible and reusable.  It also checks if a filename was provided.
* **Basic Explanation:** The code provides a basic explanation by printing the line number and line content.
* **Word Count Example:** It calculates and prints the word count for each line.
* **Keyword Check Example:** Demonstrates how to check for specific words within a line (e.g., "error", "warning").

**Further Enhancements (To Add More Sophisticated Explanations):**

* **Content-Specific Analysis:**  You can tailor the explanations based on the type of file you are processing.  For example:
    * If it's a log file, you could parse timestamps, error codes, etc.
    * If it's a configuration file, you could explain the meaning of each setting.
* **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions for more complex pattern matching and analysis.
* **Data Structures:** Store data extracted from the file in appropriate data structures (e.g., lists, maps) for further processing and reporting.
* **Output Formatting:** Improve the output formatting to make it clearer and easier to understand.


This improved version is more practical, user-friendly, and provides a good starting point for adding more sophisticated explanations depending on your specific requirements.
