   This will print the multiplication table for 8.  Replace `8` with any other integer you want.

3. **Error Handling:** The code now includes error handling using a `try-catch` block.  If the user enters something that's not a valid integer (e.g., "abc", "3.14"), the program will print an informative error message instead of crashing.

4. **Input Validation:** The code also checks if any argument has been provided at all.  If the user runs the program without providing a number, they will receive a message explaining how to use it correctly.


**Key improvements in this version:**

* **Robustness:** Handles invalid input gracefully.
* **Clearer Instructions:** Tells the user what to do if they don't provide input.
* **Best Practice:**  Using `try-catch` for exception handling is essential for robust Java code.
