nullInput Sentence 1:  \nWrite a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the Bucket Sort Algorithm.\nBucket sort is a sorting algorithm that distributes the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. It is a distribution sort, a generalization of pigeonhole sort, and a cousin of radix sort in the most-to-least significant digit flavor. Input Sentence 2: 4. write a Java program. sort an array of given integers using the bucket sort algorithm. bucket sort is a sorting algorithm that distributes the elements of an array into a number of buckets. each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. it is a distribution sort, a generalization of pigeonhole sort, and a cousin of radix sort in the most-to-least significant digit flavor.Cosine Similarity: 0.9984Euclidean Distance: 0.1940
