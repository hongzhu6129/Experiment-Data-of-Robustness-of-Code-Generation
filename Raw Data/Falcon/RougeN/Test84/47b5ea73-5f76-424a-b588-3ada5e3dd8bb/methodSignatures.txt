 Only use the method signatures public static void main(String[]) to generate code for the Problem Description : \nWrite a Java program to check whether a number is an automorphic number or not. In mathematics, an automorphic number is a number whose square "ends" in the same digits as the number itself. For example, 5 = 25, 6 = 36, 76 = 5776, and 890625 = 793212890625, so 5, 6, 76 and 890625 are all automorphic numbers.\nInput a number : 76                                                   \nAutomorphic Number.\n\n\n The programming language you need to use is: java.\n\n
