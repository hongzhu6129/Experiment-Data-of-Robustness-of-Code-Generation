Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles empty arrays and `null` input.
- **Clearer variable names:**  `uniqueIndex` is more descriptive than just `j`.
- **Improved comments:** Comments explain the logic more thoroughly.
- **Comprehensive `main` method:** Includes more test cases to demonstrate different scenarios, including empty and null arrays.
- **Uses `Arrays.copyOfRange`:**  In the `main` method,  `Arrays.copyOfRange` is used to print only the relevant part of the modified array (up to the new length), avoiding printing the unchanged "garbage" values at the end.



This revised version provides a more robust and understandable solution to the problem.
