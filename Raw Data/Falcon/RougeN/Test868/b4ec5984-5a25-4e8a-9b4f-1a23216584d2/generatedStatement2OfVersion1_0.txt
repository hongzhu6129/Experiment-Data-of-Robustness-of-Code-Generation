**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Multiple Iteration Methods:** The code demonstrates multiple ways to iterate, including enhanced for loop, iterator, `poll()`, `toArray()`, and Java Streams.  It also explains which methods are destructive (remove elements).
* **Preserving Order:**  The output clearly indicates which methods preserve the priority queue's order (most do, except for `poll()` which retrieves and *removes* the head, altering the queue).
* **`poll()` Warning:**  The code emphasizes that using `poll()` to iterate is destructive, and provides a way to copy the queue first if you need to preserve the original.
* **Clearer Output:**  The output is formatted to be more readable, separating the results of different methods with newlines.
* **Modern Java Features:**  The code uses `var` for type inference (Java 10+) and Java Streams (Java 8+) where appropriate, demonstrating modern Java practices.
* **Comments:**  The code is well-commented to explain each iteration method and its characteristics.



This revised answer offers a more complete and educational example of iterating through a `PriorityQueue` in Java.  It emphasizes best practices, highlights potential pitfalls, and uses modern language features where appropriate.
