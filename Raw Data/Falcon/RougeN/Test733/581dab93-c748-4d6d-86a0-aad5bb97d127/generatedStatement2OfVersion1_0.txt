Key improvements in this version:

* **Handles edge cases:** The code now correctly handles empty (`{}`) and `null` arrays without throwing exceptions.
* **Clearer output:** The `main` method now prints the updated array contents (the unique elements) along with the length, making it easier to verify the results.  It uses `Arrays.copyOfRange` to only display the relevant portion of the array after duplicates are removed.
* **More test cases:**  Added more test cases in `main` to demonstrate the handling of different scenarios (duplicates at the beginning, duplicates throughout, already unique array).
* **Efficiency:** The `removeDuplicates` method continues to be efficient using only O(1) extra space (in-place modification).  It iterates through the array only once.
