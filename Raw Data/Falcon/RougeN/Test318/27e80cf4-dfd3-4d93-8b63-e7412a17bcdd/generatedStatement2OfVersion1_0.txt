This code combines both problems within a single `main` method:

1. **Average Calculation:**
   - It declares three `double` variables (`num1`, `num2`, `num3`) and initializes them with example values.  You can modify these to take input from the user if needed (using `Scanner` which would require modifying the method signature, or command line arguments by parsing `args`).
   - It calculates the average and stores it in the `average` variable.
   - It prints the average to the console.

2. **Rectangle Area and Perimeter:**
   - It declares `width` and `height` variables and initializes them with the given test data (5.5 and 8.5).
   - It calculates the area and perimeter using the standard formulas.
   - It prints the area and perimeter to the console.
