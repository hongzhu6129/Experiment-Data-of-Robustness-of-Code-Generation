**How to run the tests (manually):**

1. Save the code as `AverageCalculator.java`.
2. Compile: `javac AverageCalculator.java`
3. Run: `java AverageCalculator`
4. Enter the input values when prompted.


**Key Improvements in the code:**

* **Input Validation:** The `try-catch` block handles `InputMismatchException` to prevent the program from crashing if the user enters non-numeric input.
* **Resource Management:** The `scanner.close()` is now in a `finally` block. This is crucial to ensure that the `Scanner` is closed even if an exception occurs, preventing resource leaks.
* **Clearer Error Message:** The error message is more informative, telling the user exactly what went wrong.
* **Testability:** The `calculateAverage` method is now a separate function.  This makes unit testing much easier (you can call `calculateAverage` directly with various inputs in a testing framework like JUnit).



This revised answer provides a more robust and testable solution for calculating the average of three numbers in Java. The test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.  This comprehensive approach is essential for good software development practice.
