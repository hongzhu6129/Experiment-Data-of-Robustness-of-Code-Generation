Explanation and Improvements:

1. **ListIterator:** The most flexible and recommended approach is using a `ListIterator`. It allows you to start iterating from a specific position and also provides methods to traverse both forwards and backwards.

2. **Error Handling (For Loop):** The for loop version now includes a crucial check to ensure that `startPosition` is within the valid bounds of the list. This prevents `IndexOutOfBoundsException` errors if an invalid `startPosition` is provided.

3. **Clarity:** Comments have been added to explain the code and its purpose, including explaining why `ListIterator` is generally preferred and where a simpler `for` loop might suffice.

4. **Example List:**  A sample list is created for demonstration.  You can easily modify the contents of `involvedList` to test with different data.


How to Run:

1. Save the code as `IterateFromPosition.java`.
2. Compile: `javac IterateFromPosition.java`
3. Run: `java IterateFromPosition`
