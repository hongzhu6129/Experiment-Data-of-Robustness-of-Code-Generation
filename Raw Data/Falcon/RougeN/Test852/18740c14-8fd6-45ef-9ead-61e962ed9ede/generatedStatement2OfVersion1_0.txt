**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Double Precision:** The code now uses `double` for the calculations and the `1.0` instead of `1` to ensure floating-point division is performed, yielding a more accurate approximation of pi.  Integer division would have resulted in incorrect results.

2. **Clarity and Readability:** The code is formatted for better readability, with clear variable names and comments explaining the purpose of each calculation.

3. **Correct Formula Application:**  The provided formula alternates signs. The code correctly applies the alternating `+` and `-` signs in the series.

4. **Two Approximations:**  The code calculates and displays both the approximation up to 1/11 and the approximation up to 1/13 as requested in the prompt.


This improved version addresses the issues in the previous responses and provides a correct and more precise approximation of pi using the given formula.
