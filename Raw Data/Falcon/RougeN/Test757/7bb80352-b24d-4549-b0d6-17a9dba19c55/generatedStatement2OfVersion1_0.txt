Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using names like `losAngeles` instead of `zoneId1` makes the code easier to understand.
* **`formatOffset` Method:**  Handles formatting the offset into a string like "GMT-08:00" or "GMT+01:00", making the output much more readable.  It now also correctly handles the sign and pads with zeros.
* **Optional Specific Time Example:** Demonstrates how to get the offset for a specific date and time, as sometimes offsets can change due to daylight saving time.
* **Comments:** Explaining each section of the code.
* **Absolute Value for Minutes:** Ensures the minutes are always positive in the formatted offset.


This revised code provides a much better solution for defining, extracting, and displaying zone offsets in Java.  It addresses the prompt's requirement to use only `main` and `formatOffset` methods effectively.
