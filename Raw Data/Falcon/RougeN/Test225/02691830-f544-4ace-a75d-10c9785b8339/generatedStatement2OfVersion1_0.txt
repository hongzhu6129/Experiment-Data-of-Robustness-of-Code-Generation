Key improvements and explanations in this version:

1. **Odd Order Check:**  The code now includes a check to ensure that `n` is odd.  Magic squares using this method (Siamese method) can only be generated for odd orders.  An informative message is printed if the user enters an even number.

2. **Clearer Comments:**  More comments have been added to explain the logic, especially the wrap-around handling and the condition for moving down a row.

3. **Formatted Output:** The `printf` method is used to format the output so that the numbers in the magic square align nicely, even for larger values of `n`.

4. **Optional Magic Sum Verification:** The code includes a commented-out section that calculates and prints the magic sum. You can uncomment this if you want to verify that the generated square is indeed magic.


How to use it:

1. Save the code as `MagicSquare.java`.
2. Compile: `javac MagicSquare.java`
3. Run: `java MagicSquare`

Change the value of `n` in the `main` method to generate magic squares of different (odd) sizes.
