Key improvements in this version:

* **Clarity:** The code explicitly calculates both the current seconds since the epoch and the total seconds within the year 1970, clearly labeling each result.
* **Accuracy:** The calculation for seconds in 1970 is now accurate by including the final second of the year (+1) and handling potential leap seconds that might have occurred during that year by using `toEpochSecond`.
* **Readability:** Uses more descriptive variable names and comments to explain the logic.
* **Correctness:** Uses `ZoneOffset.UTC` consistently to avoid potential timezone issues.  Epoch time is always relative to UTC.  This is crucial for correctness.




If you just need the seconds in 1970 (which the prompt implies more strongly), you can simplify the `main` method:
