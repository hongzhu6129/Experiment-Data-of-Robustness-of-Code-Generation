5. **Input:**  2147483647 (Integer.MAX_VALUE)  // Test for potential overflow
   **Expected Output:** (Check for correct results, might overflow for some multiplications) The output will likely be correct for smaller multiples, but larger ones (like 9 and 10) might exhibit integer overflow, resulting in unexpected negative values.

6. **Input:** -2147483648 (Integer.MIN_VALUE) // Test for potential overflow.  Similar to MAX_VALUE,  -2147483648 * 2 or higher will likely overflow in Java.


**How to Run the Test Cases:**

1. **Manually:** You can run the program multiple times, entering each test case input as prompted. Verify the output against the expected output.
2. **Automated Testing (Recommended):**  Using JUnit or TestNG (testing frameworks in Java) is the best practice.  You would write separate test methods for each case.  Example using JUnit:
