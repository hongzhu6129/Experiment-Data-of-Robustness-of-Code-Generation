Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Handles Negative Numbers:** The code now uses `Math.abs(number)` to handle negative input correctly.  The sum of the digits is calculated based on the absolute value.
2. **Clearer Output:**  Spaces are added between the English words representing the digits of the sum. A new line is printed at the end for better formatting.
3. **Error Handling (optional but good practice):** The `print_number` method includes a basic check to handle potential errors if the digit is outside the 0-9 range, although it's not strictly necessary in this case because the sum's digits will always be in that range.
4. **Resource Management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `input.close()` to release the resource. This is good practice.
5. **Comments and Readability:**  The code has comments explaining the steps for better understanding.


This improved version addresses all the requirements of the problem statement and provides a more robust and well-structured solution.
