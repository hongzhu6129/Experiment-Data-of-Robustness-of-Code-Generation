Key improvements:

* **Handles negative numbers:** The code now uses `Math.abs()` to correctly calculate the sum of digits even for negative input.
* **Clearer output:**  A space is added between the English words representing the digits of the sum, making the output more readable.  A newline is also added at the end of the output.
* **Improved `print_number`:** The `print_number` method is more concise using a `switch` statement, which is more efficient than a chain of `if-else if`.  A `default` case is included for robustness (though it shouldn't be reached with correct usage).
* **Resource management:** The `Scanner` is closed using `scanner.close()` which is good practice.
