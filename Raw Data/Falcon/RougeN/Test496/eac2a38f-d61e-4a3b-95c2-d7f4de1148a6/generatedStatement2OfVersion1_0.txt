Key improvements:

* **Correct Star Pattern:** The code now correctly alternates the star pattern on each row to create the offset effect seen in a real flag.
* **Clearer Structure:** The code is separated into logical blocks for printing the starred section and the striped section, making it easier to understand and modify.
* **Adjustable Stripe Length:**  The number of `=` characters used can be easily adjusted if you want longer or shorter stripes.  The star section and stripe sections are printed with different loop lengths to get the desired output shape.  The  "34" and "46" constants control these lengths.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain what each part of the code does.
