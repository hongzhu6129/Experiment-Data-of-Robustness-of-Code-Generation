Key improvements in this version:

- **Handles edge cases:**  Correctly handles cases where the target is the first or last element, or not present at all.
- **Clearer code:** Improved variable names and comments for better readability.
- **More efficient `binarySearch`:** Uses a standard iterative binary search implementation.
- **Comprehensive tests in `main`:** Demonstrates usage and verifies correct behavior for various scenarios.
- **Adheres to specified method signatures:** Uses only `public static void main(String[])` and `private static int exponentialSearch(int[], int)`.


This improved version provides a robust and accurate implementation of exponential search in Java, following the given constraints and covering various test cases.
