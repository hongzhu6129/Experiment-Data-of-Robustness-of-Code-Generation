**Test Cases:**

Since this program has no input and simply prints a fixed output, traditional unit testing with assertions isn't very applicable.  Instead, we can consider "visual testing" and verifying against the expected output string.  While not a corner case in the traditional sense, we can think about different output environments that might affect the rendering (though this is more of a system-level concern).

1. **Standard Output Test:**
   - Run the program and visually inspect the output.  Does it resemble a face?  Does the spacing match the intended design?  This is the primary "test."  You'd compare the console output with the expected face:
