**Test Cases (Conceptual - Java doesn't have a simple way to directly test console output without using external libraries or redirecting streams):**

1. **Basic Functionality Test:**  Run the `printFace()` method. Visually verify that the output matches the intended face shape and characters.  This confirms the core logic is working.

2. **Character Encoding Test:**  Run the program on different systems/terminals with varying character encodings (e.g., UTF-8, ASCII). Ensure the face displays correctly, and special characters like " " and "|" are rendered as expected.  This checks for encoding compatibility.

3. **Output Redirection Test (Advanced):**  Redirect the program's output to a file.  Then, compare the contents of the file against the expected face representation.  This requires some shell scripting or file I/O but allows for automated testing. For example, on Linux/macOS:
