* **Special characters:** The program should handle special characters and spaces correctly.

**Regular Cases:**

* **No duplicate characters:** The program should return the original string if there are no duplicate characters nearby.
* **Consecutive duplicate characters:** The program should remove all duplicate characters that are next to each other.
* **Non-consecutive duplicate characters:** The program should remove only nearby duplicate characters, leaving non-nearby duplicates intact.
